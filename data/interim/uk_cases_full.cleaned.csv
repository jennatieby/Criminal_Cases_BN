Neutral Citation Number: [2022] EWCA Crim 933 CASE NO 202103929/A3 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL CRIMINAL DIVISION Royal Courts of Justice Sitting at Mold Crown Court The Law Courts Mold CH7 1AE Wednesday 25 May 2022 B e f o r e : LADY JUSTICE NICOLA DAVIES DBE MRS JUSTICE JEFFORD DBE MRS JUSTICE COLLINS RICE DBE ____________________ REGINA V CHUN XU ____________________ Computer Aided Transcript of Epiq Europe Ltd, Lower Ground, 18-22 Furnival Street, London EC4A 1JS Tel No: 020 7404 1400; Email: rcj@epiqglobal.co.uk (Official Shorthand Writers to the Court) ____________________ MR T CROWTHER QC appeared on behalf of the Applicant ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © MRS JUSTICE JEFFORD: On 9 November 2021 in the Crown Court at Merthyr Tydfil, the applicant, then aged 32, was convicted following a trial of the murder of Wenjing Lin and the attempted murder of Yongquan Jiang. Wenjing was the 16-year-old daughter of Meifang Xu and Yongquan was Meifang's husband and stepfather to Wenjing. On 12 November 2021 the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Wenjing with a minimum term of 30 years. For the attempted murder of Yongquan he was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment to run concurrently. He sought leave to appeal in respect of the minimum term. Leave was refused by the single judge and he now renews that application. Meifang's parents had, in China, lived next door to the applicant's parents. She had known him since birth and treated him like a member of her family. In 2020, Meifang and the applicant we both now living in the United Kingdom. The applicant and his brother-in-law collected £30,000 from Meifang which was intended to be sent back to China to repay money she had borrowed to start a take-away business. The applicant did not send all of the money to China and eventually told Yongquan that he had used, and lost, much of the money in gambling. Meifang's evidence was that £14,000 of that money had not been sent back to China. The applicant was paying off the debt that he owed to Meifang in instalments and the amount of the debt had been reduced to something in excess of £7,000. At trial there was evidence that, or that the applicant believed that, Meifang had told his sister or other members of his family about his debt and his gambling. On 4 March 2021 the applicant visited Meifang and her family at their take-away business, the Blue Sky Chinese take-away in Treherbert. The applicant had called Meifang the day before asking to visit, which was unusual, and had asked Meifang not to tell anyone else that he was visiting. He spent the afternoon and the evening with the family and after the shop closed at around 11 pm they all had dinner, before going to bed. The applicant stayed the night. The night before that the applicant had stayed at another business in Pontypridd and had taken with him, from that business, a knife. At 7.55 am on 5 March 2021 the applicant made internet searches on his mobile phone including, ""Will fingerprints be burnt by fire?"", ""My fingerprints are on the knife. Will the fingerprints still exist after [the knife] is burnt by fire?"", ""Fingerprints are left on a brick if [I] burn the [brick] [can I] get rid of the fingerprints?"". Later that morning the applicant strangled 16-year-old Wenjing to death. Wenjing, still at school, had got up earlier than others to log on to an online maths class. She was an exemplary student who was expected to receive excellent GCSE results. Her mother heard her getting up and getting into the shower. Wenjing was exchanging Snapchat messages with a friend and the last message was sent by her at 9.27 am. Her friend tried to message her further but got no reply. By that time she had been killed by the applicant. He had strangled her face to face with his bare hands. At 10.21 am the applicant rang Meifang's mobile phone. She was still asleep and did not answer. Yongquan woke at around 11 am. He saw the applicant standing at the bottom of the stairs. The applicant asked Yongquan if he could have some fish out of the freezer in the basement to take with him when he left. Yongquan, in his dressing gown and bare foot, led the way down to the basement. Yongquan then opened the freezer and bent in to get the fish out. The applicant started to stab him with a knife to his neck. Yongquan turned round and saw that the applicant had two knives. He asked the applicant what he was doing but he did not reply and kept attacking Yongquan, aiming the knife towards his head. Yongquan grabbed him to try and stop him and they fell to the floor. There was a struggle and the applicant stopped his attack saying that he was tired and asking if they should stop fighting. Yongquan took hold of the applicant's hands to protect himself and they sat on the basement stairs. He asked the applicant why he had attacked him and the applicant replied, ""Money, money, money."" Yongquan then called out for his wife. He asked the applicant if he could ring his wife but the applicant said ""No"". Yongquan asked if he could ring his daughter and the applicant said he could, although he (the applicant) of course knew by that time that she was dead. Yongquan tried calling her but received no reply. The applicant then told him to stop using his phone and said he wanted to kill himself. He threw one of the knives away but kept the other. Yongquan heard his wife upstairs and called out to her. The applicant then resumed his attack on Yongquan as Meifang came downstairs to the basement. Yongquan told his wife that the applicant had stabbed him from behind. She tried to call a friend, but the applicant stopped her by biting her on the arm. Yongquan then managed to get the knife off the applicant and went upstairs. There he found Wenjing lying on the floor by the shop counter. Efforts to revive Wenjing were hopeless. For the purposes of sentencing and having heard all of the evidence at trial, the judge formed the view that this was a carefully and callously planned crime which the judge described as a vengeful and murderous attack. The motive for this attack on the family was revenge for Meifang having told others about the applicant's gambling and debt. He took advantage of his relationship with the family, their friendship and the fact that Meifang saw him as part of her extended family to engineer a situation in which he would stay the night and find the family vulnerable in their own home. The judge was sure that the applicant's intention was to kill Meifang, but first to kill the other members of her family in such a way as to cause her the maximum possible anguish. He was thwarted in his plan, and did not go on to kill Meifang, only because Yongquan fought back and was able to subdue him. As part of his plan the appellant had taken with him a knife which he used in the attack on Yongquan. He had carried out internet searches about the destruction of fingerprint evidence by fire. The applicant first quietly killed Wenjing with his hands and then lured Yongquan to the basement waiting until he was in a vulnerable position bent over the freezer to attack him from behind with two knives, slashing and stabbing him about 20 times. As the judge summarised it, this was a revenge attack with the aim of killing a family in retribution for a very trivial reason. In fixing the minimum term the judge carefully considered whether this offence could properly be characterised as a murder for gain. He was not sure that it was a murder for gain and he did not proceed on that basis. Instead he took as his starting point a minimum term of 15 years in accordance with paragraph 5 of schedule 21 to the Sentencing Act 2020. He properly concluded that there were no statutory aggravating features, but he took into account other aggravating features to which we have already made reference. Those were the planning of this offence including the deception of the family, the young age of Wenjing, the fact that she was murdered in her own home and the terror that she must have felt when strangled face to face. If that offence of murder were to be sentenced in isolation the minimum term the judge would have fixed was one of 22 years' imprisonment. The applicant does not, and could not in our judgment, argue that such a minimum term would have been manifestly excessive. The judge had, however, also to take into account the conviction for the attempted murder of Yongquan. Having regard to the Definitive Guideline for cases of attempted murder, the judge found this to be a Category 2B case. That categorisation was accepted by the applicant in counsel's note for sentencing and it is not and could not be criticised before us. Accordingly the starting point for this offence of attempted murder was a sentence of 25 years' imprisonment and the range was 20 to 30 years. There were a number of aggravating features of this offence. Again it was planned and, in particular, the applicant had lured his victim into a vulnerable position. He used the knife or knives that he had brought with him, it was a sustained attack, and the attack on Yongquan has had a significant impact on him, to some extent physical but particularly mental in that he has lost his confidence. Further, both he and Meifang feel deeply the loss of their beloved daughter. Nonetheless the judge did not increase the sentence over the starting point and imposed a sentence of 25 years' imprisonment for this offence. The judge correctly noted that the applicant would have served 16 years and eight months of a determinate sentence of that length. He similarly correctly observed that he could not simply add that to the period of the minimum term for the offence of murder, but rather that he should have regard to the criminality as a whole. He directed himself in that respect, taking account of the decision of the Court of Appeal in R v Farhad Mahmud [2014] EWCA Crim 1008 and the decision in R v Jama Ahmed [2018] EWCA Crim 739 . Having done so he increased the minimum term to one of 30 years' imprisonment. In doing so he explained clearly the approach he was taking and that he was uplifting the minimum term to reflect the conviction for attempted murder and the overall criminality of the applicant. Mr Crowther QC, who appears pro bono on behalf of the applicant accepts that uplifting the minimum term to take account of the conviction for attempted murder was the proper approach and indeed the one that he had advocated on behalf of the applicant. But he submits that in making that uplift the judge was wrongly double-counting the aggravating features and that the resultant minimum term was in any event manifestly excessive and did not properly reflect totality. We can see no merit at all in that submission. There was some commonality in the aggravating features relating to the count of murder and the count of attempted murder. That is because they were part of the planned sequence of this attack. The planning of this attack therefore necessarily played a part both in the judge's assessment of the minimum term that he would have fixed if the offence of murder had been looked at in isolation and in the fixing of the determinate sentence for the attempted murder. In indicating the minimum term that he would have fixed looking at the count of murder in isolation, he took account of the further aggravating features of that offence. Similarly in fixing the determinate sentence for the attempted murder charge he took account of the aggravating features of that offence. What the judge was entitled to do and did was uplift the minimum term to reflect the totality of the offending and the criminality. He properly recognised that he could not add the determinate sentence of 25 years, or the element of such a sentence that would have been served, to the minimum term and instead increased the minimum term by eight years. We have already said that we do not regard that as involving any element of double-counting. Further, taking account of all the aggravating features we do not see that that could possibly be regarded as resulting in a sentence that was manifestly excessive. The minimum term of 30 years properly reflects the overall criminality of this offending. Mr Crowther QC places reliance on the decisions in Mahmud and Ahmed as indicating the scale of uplift to a minimum term that might be appropriate in a case such as this, although he carefully and clearly does not go so far as to suggest that these decisions set some kind of tariff. His submission is that the uplift in these cases was, as a percentage, significantly less than in the present case. The submission is one of proportionality rather than tariff. We do not consider this comparison or percentage approach to be helpful. Mahmud, for example, was a case in which there was a single act of arson which resulted in multiple deaths or attempted murders. The murder of more than one person meant that the starting point was a minimum term of 30 years and any uplift for the offences of attempted murder has to be seen in the context of that high starting point. In the present case there were two distinct offences, albeit forming part of a sequence of events. The starting point was a lower one, but one which the judge was entitled to increase both for the aggravating features of the murder and for the attempted murder. There is nothing in the decisions in Mahmud or Ahmed which points to or supports some sort of percentage approach to this uplift. In short, all cases turn on their own facts. In this case the judge's sentence was unimpeachable. This appeal has no prospect of success and leave to appeal is refused.

Neutral Citation Number: [2025] EWCA Crim 969 Case No: 202501491 B4 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL (CRIMINAL DIVISION) ON APPEAL FROM THE CROWN COURT Royal Courts of Justice Strand, London, WC2A 2LL 23/07/2025 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE EDIS MR JUSTICE CALVER and HER HONOUR JUDGE MORRIS Honorary Recorder of Winchester, sitting as a judge of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division ____________________ Between: THE KING Respondent - and - ANL Appellant ____________________ Lewis Power KC and Darryl Cherrett (assigned by the Registrar) for the Appellant Jane Osborne KC and Paul Casey (instructed by the CPS London Homicide Team) for the Respondent Hearing dates : 23 July 2023 ____________________ HTML VERSION OF APPROVED JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © Lord Justice Edis: This is an appeal by leave of the trial judge against a decision he made in a preparatory hearing that it is lawful for the prosecution to be granted a retrial on an allegation of murder against ANL. The ruling was made after a trial where the jury convicted ANL of count 2, manslaughter, which had been added to the indictment as an alternative to murder, which was count 1. They were discharged from returning a verdict on count 1 following their inability to agree a verdict on it. The appeal is brought under section 35 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. We have received helpful written and oral submissions from counsel on both sides, for which we are grateful. During the deliberations, the judge received a note from the jury. Although he was unable to reveal the content, he told the court that he had reason to believe that if the jury were unable to reach a verdict on count 1 in relation to the appellant, it was likely that they would be able to reach a verdict in relation to count 2 in his case. On the morning of 17 th January 2025 he received a further note indicating that they were unable to reach a verdict in relation to murder but had proceeded to consider count 2 and had reached a verdict on that count. The matter was discussed in court and the judge subsequently discharged the jury from returning a verdict on count 1 in ANL's case, and invited them to consider count 2. They did so and subsequently returned a unanimous verdict of guilty in relation to manslaughter on the afternoon of 17 th January 2025. As a result of the jury failing to agree in the first trial, a co-defendant also faces a retrial for manslaughter. On a later date, the prosecution informed the court that they intended to seek retrials in the two cases where the jury had been unable to agree verdicts, and an objection to this was made on behalf of ANL on the ground that the court might be precluded from doing so in light of the procedure that had been undertaken in relation to the taking of the verdicts. On 15 th March 2025, the judge ordered that a preparatory hearing should be held so that the issues could be fully argued and determined. The hearing took place on Friday 28 th March 2025 and the judge decided that it was lawful for a retrial against the appellant for murder to take place. In his ruling, the judge set out the facts of the case and the history of the proceedings. He referred to R v McEvilly [2008] EWCA Crim 162 and R v Fernandez [1997] 1 Cr App R 123. He said that those cases decided that where there were two charges in the alternative on an indictment arising from the same facts, the judge should not take a verdict on the less serious count until finality (for example a not guilty verdict or a decision to discharge the jury) had been reached in relation to the more serious charge. The judge recorded that he had been invited to discharge the jury from returning a verdict on the murder count and to take the manslaughter verdict. Nothing had been said by counsel as to what, if any, consequence might follow in relation to the future possibility of retrying the murder count. Had the question been raised, the judge would have sought to resolve that issue before agreeing to discharge the jury from returning a verdict on count 1. The judge considered that the verdicts suggested that the jury were sure that he participated in the attack which resulted in the death of the deceased but fewer than 10 jurors were sure that he had an intention to kill or cause really serious injury. Contrary to their submissions at the time, counsel for the prosecution submitted that the taking of the manslaughter verdict for the appellant was an irregularity as this would never have been an acceptable disposal of the indictment in his case. Alternatively, it was submitted that the taking of the verdict did not preclude a retrial on the murder count. Counsel for the appellant submitted that there was no irregularity in the taking of the verdict and that it would be an abuse of the process of the court to permit a retrial. The judge considered R v Saunders [1987] 85 Cr App R 334 ("" Saunders"" ) and concluded that the circumstances of that case were very different from those with which he was dealing. The judge noted that he had not asked whether a retrial might be sought and had not been asked to form a view or express a view as to whether a conviction for manslaughter would suffice to provide a just determination of the case. He would have done so if asked and would not have exercised any judicial discretion so as to preclude the possibility of a retrial. The judge also considered R v Bayode [2013] EWCA Crim 356 ("" Bayode ""), R v Skeete [2002] EWCA Crim 1654 , and R v Yusuff and Others v The Governor of HMP Belmarsh [2024] EWHC 692. He did not find that any of these decisions prevented the court from conducting a retrial of ANL on count 1. The prosecution had invited the judge to set aside the verdict on count 2 in order to allow section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1968 to have full effect and for the verdict on the alternative count to follow an acquittal of the more serious count rather than the jury being unable to agree. The judge declined to take this course. He held that the retrial of the appellant for murder could be conducted fairly and any potential unfairness would be addressed by the court exercising its discretion in relation to the admissibility of evidence. If a new jury convicted the appellant of murder, his manslaughter conviction would fall away or could be quashed by order of the court so as not to offend the rule against contradictory convictions. The Grounds of Appeal The appellant contends that the judge erred in i) Finding that it was lawful for the appellant to be retried for murder. The judge should have followed the decision in Bayode as the circumstances were more closely aligned to the facts of the present case. It is submitted that R v McEvilly can be distinguished as: a) The facts and circumstances of that case are completely different from the present case. b) In McEvilly , there had been no finality in the jury's consideration of the more serious count. ii) Failing to find that the crown's decision to retry the appellant in these circumstances amounted to an abuse of the court's process. Respondent's Grounds of Opposition The prosecution contends that the judge did not err in his ruling. It remains the prosecution's case that the cases of Saunders and Bayode were not only decided on substantially different facts but they do not definitively determine the issue of whether a re-trial in such circumstances would be an abuse of the court's process. However, if the judge's ruling is deemed to be incorrect or if the consequence of his ruling is that a retrial for the appellant on count 1 is deemed to be unfair, then the indictment should not be stayed as an abuse of process. It is submitted that the conviction on count 2 could simply be excluded from the jury's consideration. Alternatively the court could quash the conviction on count 2 and allow a retrial to proceed on both counts as per R v Fernandez . Analysis and discussion Procedural rules exist in order to facilitate the doing of justice. Although the criminal justice system in England and Wales has a procedural code, contained in the Criminal Procedure Rules, that code does not contain any rule which prevents a retrial being ordered in a case such as the present. The overriding objective of the code, it is said in Rule 1.1, ""is that criminal cases be dealt with justly"". Rule 1.2 identifies 8 factors which are included within that objective to which regard should be had when making procedural decisions. These include ""acquitting the innocent and convicting the guilty"". None of them is served by the suggested rule that a retrial for murder cannot be held in this case. That suggests that the origin and scope of this rule should be carefully examined before it should be held to deny the prosecution the opportunity to present its case on murder for decision by a new jury which may be able to agree on a verdict. The effect of the proposed rule is to treat ANL as if he had been acquitted of murder by the jury when he has not been. Justice requires a decision by a jury of the murder allegation. The proposed rule does not facilitate the doing of justice in that way; it prevents it. The Rule The rule which we are invited to apply (""the Rule"") provides that where a defendant is charged with two or more offences which are alternatives to each other in the strict legal sense, he or she cannot be convicted of both or all of them. If, therefore, there is a conviction for a lesser offence then a verdict of guilty cannot be returned on any more serious offence, either at the same trial which resulted in the conviction or at a retrial following that first trial. Any attempt to secure such a conviction at a retrial would be an abuse of the process of the court. The most common situation where such an attempt may be made is following the discharge of the jury which returned the guilty verdict of the lesser offence but which could not agree a verdict on the more serious offence. The Rule applies strictly whatever view the judge may take of the requirements of justice. The Rule is said to apply to two types of alternative offences:- i) Offences which are truly alternatives in that guilt of one precludes guilt of the other. Theft and handling stolen goods is a commonly encountered example. Handling can only be committed ""otherwise than in the course of the stealing"", see section 22(1) of the Theft Act 1968. A handler of goods cannot be guilty of ""the stealing"" which caused them to become stolen goods. ii) Offences which are alternatives in that they arise out of the same conduct, but result in different legal classification of that conduct. Murder and manslaughter is one such case, and the offences under section 18 and section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 is another. The Rule does not apply in cases where offences appear on an indictment and are presented as alternatives during the trial by the prosecution but they are not alternatives in either of the senses just identified. These have been called ""forensic alternatives"", see R v Akhtar [2015] EWCA Crim 176 ; [2015] 1 WLR 3046 ("" Akhtar ""). Section 6(2) and (3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 provides a statutory code for the ability of a jury to convict of an offence not identified in a count in the indictment when finding a person not guilty of an offence specifically charged in the indictment. These provisions do not, however, address a case where a jury cannot agree on that specific count and have to be discharged. Neither do they deal with a case, such as the present, where the lesser offence is specifically charged in the indictment in a separate count. They provide a lawful basis for conviction by a jury of an offence which is not charged in the indictment but which is comprehended within an offence which is, and provide a method of determining which offences are in play before the jury by this route. The Rule is, therefore, if it exists, a creature of the common law. The origin of the Rule The origin of the Rule is Saunders , at least according to Akhtar at [30]: ""Turning to the principle that once an accused has been convicted of the lesser of two alternatives, a further trial is an abuse of process, the starting point is the decision of the House of Lords in R v Saunders [1988] AC 148."" In fact, Saunders is not authority for the Rule. It holds that where the jury cannot agree on murder, but are able to agree a guilty verdict on manslaughter, the judge can discharge the jury from returning a verdict on murder. It was a case where the judge considered that the manslaughter conviction was an appropriate disposal of the case in the interests of justice. After reviewing some of the old cases, Lord Ackner said, at 160-161: ""Given that the judge has the judicial discretion to discharge a jury from giving a verdict, there would appear to be no good reason either in law or in common sense why on a charge of murder the trial judge should not, in the judicial exercise of his discretion, discharge the jury from giving a verdict of murder where they are agreed on a verdict of manslaughter and the judge considers that justice is properly satisfied by such a verdict. The industry of counsel has discovered no case which clearly so decides."" Saunders decides that (1) the judge has power, in an appropriate case, to bring proceedings to an end by discharging the jury from returning a verdict on murder in these circumstances and (2) this power arises even when the prosecution does not agree, and wishes to pursue the murder allegation further. Saunders is authority for these propositions. Lord Ackner said this, at 161-162:- ""In a trial on an indictment for murder, where manslaughter is a possible verdict, the jury's task is first to consider whether or not they are satisfied that the accused is guilty of murder. It is only when they have made the positive determination that the accused is not guilty of murder that they should then proceed to consider the lesser offence of manslaughter. However, there is no legal principle which prevents this impediment to considering the lesser offence being removed by judicial intervention, namely by discharging the jury from the obligation of returning a verdict on the major offence, if the justice of the case so requires. This appeal provides a very good example. This was a case where, as previously stated, the prosecution would have accepted a plea to manslaughter, if Mr. Townend's instructions had permitted his offering that plea. Before the judge took the course that he suggested, he invited the views of the prosecution and the defence. The course he proposed had their joint support. He concluded that it would be a just determination of the trial to accept a verdict of guilty on the alternative offence of manslaughter, avoiding as it would the burden of a retrial with all the anxiety which this would entail. I shall perhaps add that if, having invited the prosecution's submissions, these proved hostile to the course contemplated by the judge, he in the proper exercise of his judicial discretion would be fully entitled, having considered those submissions, to adhere to the course he proposed. In such circumstances there could be no question of the prosecution re-indicting the accused for murder. To attempt to do so would clearly be an abuse of the process of the court and the indictment would be stayed: see Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] A.C. 1254 ."" These propositions from Saunders do not apply in this case. The judge was not exercising a power to bring the proceedings to an end when he decided to take a verdict on count 2 and to discharge the jury from returning a verdict on count 1. He intended that the option to pursue a retrial on count 1 would be available to the prosecution if they sought to do so. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of the power in Saunders that the judge decides that the conviction for manslaughter sufficiently addresses the interests of justice on the facts of the particular case. This never happened in the present case. On analysis, Saunders decides something which is really quite obvious. Where the prosecution is disposed to accept a verdict of manslaughter and does not wish to pursue the allegation of murder the judge can give effect to that by taking a verdict on manslaughter, discharging the jury from returning a verdict on murder and not ordering a retrial having decided that the course favoured by the prosecutor is in the interests of justice. Where the prosecution resists that course, says Saunders , the judge has power to take this course anyway if the court decides that this is in the interests of justice. That second proposition from Saunders appears to be obiter , is not explained in the judgment, and is a significant and perhaps anomalous extension of the limited powers of a trial judge to stay a prosecution which is evidentially sound. At all events, it does not arise in the present case because both the judge and the prosecution considered that the interests of justice in this case required a retrial for murder. Saunders records a rather outdated practice which Lord Ackner describes in relation to adding a second count of manslaughter in cases where count 1 alleges murder arising out of the same killing. He said: ""Not only would this be contrary to long established practice, but I wholly agree with the observation of Lawton L.J. when giving the judgment of the court in the instant appeal that this would tend to confuse the jury. Moreover, such a course would not deal with the case, which is not uncommon, in which the possibility of a verdict of manslaughter only becomes apparent during the course of the trial. There is the further important point that there are cases in which the prosecution, on the basis of the evidence which they propose to present, consider that the only true verdict is that of murder. To include a separate count of manslaughter could well lead to the suggestion by the defence that since the prosecution have charged manslaughter, manslaughter must on the facts be an acceptable alternative. "" This reflects a practice which has long fallen into disuse. A second count of manslaughter frequently appears on an indictment for murder. This would only remain for consideration by the jury if manslaughter was an alternative which the judge intended to leave to the jury. The effect of the explicit count 2 of manslaughter, together with an appropriate route to verdict and written directions, would be to simplify the jury's task as against having to listen to oral directions on the subject, in the absence of a specific count, and then to try to remember and apply them. In such circumstances the prosecution has to deal with manslaughter anyway, and the suggested forensic disadvantage of a manslaughter count is not a substantial factor. Saunders does not say what should happen when the judge is forced to discharge the jury from returning a verdict on count 1, because they are unable to do so, but where they have indicated that they have reached a perfectly lawful and valid verdict on count 2, manslaughter, and where the judge considers that the manslaughter conviction does not meet the justice of the case. The Rule requires that the manslaughter verdict should not be taken because it prevents any further prosecution for murder whatever the interests of justice may require. The Rule, therefore, does not arise from Saunders . It is found in Bayode . In one sense this is surprising because Bayode was another case where the judge decided (on a later date) that the conviction for manslaughter was a sufficient reflection of the evidence in the case, and that, therefore, the interests of justice did not require a retrial on murder. It was, therefore, enough for the Court of Appeal to dismiss the prosecution's appeal by a simple application of the second proposition in Saunders (because the prosecution did not agree that manslaughter was enough). It was perhaps necessary to address the six questions posed by the ingenuity of counsel resisting the prosecutor's appeal, but the decision required only an application of Saunders . The issues considered in Bayode were put in this way by Hughes LJ, giving the judgment of the court: ""The issues raised in argument 14. The arguments before the judge in January and before us have ranged considerably wider than those advanced in the aftermath of the verdicts. Not all those advanced to the judge have been developed in this appeal. Those which we have to address are these:- i) does the defendant have available to him the plea in bar of autrefois convict as a result of the jury verdict of guilty of manslaughter, which for that reason prevents a further trial on the issue of murder? ii) if not, is a re-trial prevented by the principle derived from the line of cases of which R v Elrington (1861) 1 B & S 688 is an early example? iii) whether (i) or (ii) apply or not, is it possible to pursue a re-trial upon one alternative allegation where there is an extant verdict of guilty upon the other alternative? iv) what is the import of the judge's ruling on 28 January 2013 that if he had applied his mind to the question in October, he would have 'adhered to the course which I now take', viz prevented a re-trial? v) is a re-trial prevented by the fact that the jury considered manslaughter at a time when it had not reached a concluded view about murder? vi) apart from above, were there grounds for staying any re-trial on the issue of murder as an abuse of the process of the court?"" Only issue (iv) is necessary for the decision and the court was bound by Saunders to answer it in the way that it did, unless it held that the second proposition in Saunders was obiter , wrong, and not to be followed because it was inconsistent with the way the abuse of process jurisdiction has developed subsequently. This does not appear to have been argued. In fact the court dismissed the prosecution's appeal on issues (iii) and (iv). (i), (ii), (v) and (vi) did not produce that result for the reasons given. It is the court's resolution of issue (iii) which is the strongest ground on which the Rule may stand, and an issue arises whether it is obiter . In Barking & Dagenham LBC v Argos Limited [2022] EWHC 1398 (Admin) Edis LJ, with whom McGowan J agreed, said, at [40]:- ""It is true that where a judge gives two reasons for arriving at a decision they will generally both be regarded as part of the ratio. However, as Lord Simonds in Jacobs [1950] AC 361 makes clear (at p 370), the establishment of the ratio is ""not always easy"". Some of the problems were identified by Leggatt LJ in Youngsam [2020] QB 387 ."" The majority in Youngsam said (at[31]) that the law on establishing the ratio of a decision was sufficiently stated in the statement of Professor Cross in Cross & Harris, Precedent in English Law , 4th ed (1991), p 72, namely: ""The ratio decidendi of a case is any rule of law expressly or impliedly treated by the judge as a necessary step in reaching his conclusion, having regard to the line of reasoning adopted by him "" Much of the reasoning in Bayode on issue (iii), on which the Rule depends, is concerned with rejecting an argument advanced by the prosecution that the guilty verdict on manslaughter was not a conviction because Bayode had not yet been sentenced. That argument was necessary because the prosecution accepted that a person could not validly be convicted of both murder and manslaughter in respect of the same killing. The court accepted that the word ""conviction"" was commonly used in two senses, namely (1) a finding of guilt such that a sentence may lawfully be imposed; and (2) the final determination of criminal proceedings, including sentence. The court decided that for the purposes of the admissibility of convictions (section 74 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) and of appealing against conviction (the Criminal Appeal Act 1968) the meaning of conviction was (1) rather than (2) and that for the purposes of the common law in relation to alternative verdicts the word should be given the same meaning. The court in Bayode said this at [33] about the situation which arises where murder and manslaughter are charged in separate counts on this indictment: ""If, however, there are two counts, it is not necessary to vacate the plea to the lesser count (although this may well be permitted in some cases). But whether there is one count or two, there cannot be convictions for both of two offences which are properly mutually exclusive alternatives. If there were two counts, and no plea of guilty, the jury would try the defendant on both, but would not be permitted to return verdicts of guilty on more than one. In our view, the course now proposed by the Crown in this case would offend against this fundamental concept of alternative charges."" Importantly, the court considered the potential for the conviction for manslaughter to cause difficulties for the defendant at the trial, but would not have dismissed the prosecution's appeal because of them. The trial judge has ample discretion to exclude evidence where necessary to ensure the fairness of the trial. Two difficulties were considered, first the evidential problem for a defendant whose denial of any involvement in the killing is negated by the conviction for manslaughter and secondly the legal consequences of that conviction being admitted into evidence so far as the burden of proof is concerned. Hughes LJ said, at [34], after explaining why these were not grounds to dismiss the appeal: ""Both matters, however, serve to underline the reasons why the principle should be maintained that there can be one conviction only in the case of alternative charges."" With the greatest of respect to the court, it seems to us that the opposite is true. The fact that the consequences of the manslaughter conviction can be fairly managed within a retrial for murder is a reason in favour of permitting that retrial notwithstanding that the conviction for manslaughter subsists. The editors of Archbold at 4-526 have this comment on Bayode at 4-256: ""A verdict of guilty cannot be returned under s.6(3) of the 1967 Act unless the jury have found the defendant not guilty of the offence specifically charged: Collison (1980) 71 Cr. App. R. 249, CA; and see Griffiths [1998] Crim. L.R. 348, CA (a decision to like effect in relation to the similarly worded provision in s.24 of the RTOA 1988 (§ 32-224)). Where this gives rise to difficulty, because the jury are unable to agree in respect of the offence charged, an alternative count may be added to the indictment if it causes no injustice to the defendant: Collison , above. See also Saunders , § 4-529. Where such a course is adopted, there can be no retrial on the more serious alternative if the two alternatives are mutually exclusive, as with murder and manslaughter: Bayode [2013] EWCA Crim 356 (but this must be open to doubt; whilst the court said that pursuit of a retrial would offend against what it described as ""a fundamental concept of alternative charges"" which, according to the court, precludes convictions on each of two true alternatives, this overlooks long-standing practice involving trials of more serious offences taking place following pleas of guilty being entered to less serious (included) offences, and retrials of more serious offences taking place following convictions for less serious (included) offences; the true principle is, it is submitted, that nobody should be sentenced (""conviction"" in the true sense depending on ""judgment"") for both a more serious offence and a less serious included offence)."" The editors of Blackstone at D19.67 and 68, comment that it would be an ""absurd result"" if a trial ended with a jury being ""discharged from giving any verdict whatsoever when they are agreed that the accused is guilty of something"". They say that the solution to the problem reached by the case is far from satisfactory and that Saunders should be confined to its own facts. This must mean it should be regarded only as authority for the ""obvious"" proposition identified at [22] above. In our judgment, there is a significant difficulty for the proposition advanced by the court in Bayode in answering issue (iii) which is the basis of the Rule. If a conviction (as defined) for manslaughter is a bar to a trial for murder arising from the same killing, what happens when the defendant pleads guilty to manslaughter and the prosecution do not accept it? They are not denying that he is actually guilty of, at least, manslaughter but are asserting that they can prove that he is actually guilty of murder. According to R v Hazeltine [1967] 2 QB 857 the position is different depending on whether the plea was entered on the count alleging the more serious offence or on a separate count alleging the less serious alternative count. In the former case, if it is not accepted the plea is treated as withdrawn and no conviction results except by verdict of the jury. In the latter case sentence may be passed if the jury acquits of the more serious offence. The distinction on a ""novel point"" decided under the long-repealed section 39(1) the Criminal Justice Administration Act 1914 may no longer be sound, but we are concerned in this case with the second situation where the decision is not based on the 1914 Act. ""A case such as this is quite different from a case such as R v Cole 1965] 2 Q.B. 388; [1965] 3 W.L.R. 263 where there were two counts in the indictment, one charging a serious offence, one a lesser offence. That case lays down the correct procedure to be followed where a prisoner pleads guilty to the count charging the lesser offence and not guilty to the count charging the more serious offence. If the plea to the less serious offence is not accepted, the prisoner will then be put in the charge of the jury only on the more serious count. If he is acquitted on that count he will then be sentenced on the count to which he has pleaded guilty. If, on the other hand, he is convicted on the more serious count, the proper course is for the judge to allow the count to which he has pleaded guilty to remain on the file and not to proceed to sentence him on that count. In the present case, however, there was but one count which is indivisible and the only effective plea to that count in respect of which the appellant was put in charge of the jury was the plea of not guilty."" If Bayode is right on issue (iii) and the Rule subsists, how does the trial there described take place? Hazeltine was cited in Bayode but this problem was not identified. In Akhtar the court was unenthusiastic about a hard edged rule that different charges could not be brought against a person arising from the same facts, and pointed out that where there was duplication between offences of which a person was convicted, no separate penalty could be imposed in respect of any which were otiose, see [38] and [41]. This is not always appropriate as a sentencing technique, see R v WAG [2025] EWCA Crim 968 , but the overall sentence for any series of offences will always be proportionate to the criminality involved, as required by the Sentencing Council's guideline on Totality, effective from July 2023. It is an unnecessary complication, in many cases, for the same conduct to be charged as different criminal offences but it ought not to operate to increase the sentence at all. What then is the vice which the Rule seeks to cure? Decision It seems to us that there are at least four outcomes which we should deal with. We leave out of account the submission that we should allow the appeal because the retrial cannot be fair. A similar submission was made in Bayode without success. If the retrial cannot be fair, then it should be stayed by the trial judge. If he wrongly fails to take that step, then an appeal lies to this court after any conviction even if the ruling is not made within a preparatory hearing to enable an appeal to be brought before trial. Before staying the retrial the judge would explore all options to ensure that prejudicial evidence is not wrongly admitted, against ANL and those options, in this case, might include severing the trial from that of the other person who faces a retrial. The judge was clearly right to take this view. These four outcomes to the submission that no retrial can lawfully take place, even if it is a fair trial:- i) We might dismiss the appeal, holding that the decision on issue (iii) in Bayode was obiter , and based on an obiter observation in Saunders , and not follow it. In that case, ANL remains convicted of manslaughter and is retried for murder. ii) We might express concerns about whether Bayode was rightly decided on issue (iii), but hold that it is binding on us and we must follow it. This would result in the appeal being allowed and no retrial of ANL for murder. iii) We might hold that Saunders should be confined to its own facts and that, except in precisely the same situation at Saunders, a jury can only return a verdict of guilty to manslaughter if they have acquitted of murder, by reason of section 6(2) of the 1967 Act. Since that did not happen, the conviction for manslaughter was irregular, must be quashed and a retrial on murder and manslaughter can take place. iv) We might allow appeal, following the decision on issue (iii) in Bayode because it is right. We do not consider that either (iii) or (iv) in paragraph 41 are appropriate outcomes. The judge considered that he may have had a power to quash or in some other way dispose of the jury's verdict convicting ANL of manslaughter. We do not agree. Equally, neither party has sought to appeal against that conviction, attacking the decision (with which both agreed) that the verdict should taken in the circumstances which prevailed. The appeal is brought against the ruling in the preparatory hearing that a retrial for murder should take place notwithstanding the conviction for manslaughter. That is the decision with which ANL is unhappy. Under section 35(3) of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 on hearing this kind of appeal, we may confirm, reverse or vary the decision appealed against. There is nothing there to suggest that we have any greater powers in relation to the decision than the judge had. For the reasons identified above, we do not consider that the decision in Bayode was right on issue (iii). We therefore turn to the question of whether we are bound by it. We have explained above at [22] something about the ambit of the decision in Saunders . We have also explained above how the prosecution argued the case in Bayode . As we have pointed out at [27] above, the prosecution did not seek to argue that there is no rule that a person cannot be convicted of both manslaughter and murder in respect of the same killing. The jury cannot convict of both, by reason of the Criminal Law Act, and the circumstances where both convictions might co-exist are very rare, probably limited to the case where a plea to manslaughter has been entered but rejected and the present situation where a jury has convicted of manslaughter and failed to agree on murder. There is no authority cited for the proposition advanced at paragraph 33 of Bayode . Although Hazeltine was mentioned by the court, the important passage cited above does not seem to have been relied upon by the prosecution. Moreover, the prosecution did not point out that the assertion of a power in the court to prevent a retrial where the prosecution was hostile to that course was obiter and inconsistent with the subsequent development of the law of abuse of process in R (ex Bennett) v. Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court [1994] 1 AC 42 . It asserts a species of abuse which does not fit in the classification adopted in this case and now firmly established in the criminal law. Had that argument been made successfully, that court's approach may have been affected. The prosecution drew our attention to the common case where, after a person is convicted of an offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, the victim dies. This has never been held to bar a prosecution for murder. It is a further indication that the Rule is not soundly based which was not fully addressed in Bayode . We have pointed out above that the exercise of identifying the ratio of a decision which rested on more than one ground is not always straightforward, and the case of Bayode on issue (iii) is a good example of this. In our judgment, having regard to the matters set out above it is open to this court to hold that it should be treated as not essential to the decision dismissing that prosecution appeal which was justified by another ground. For the reasons given we hold that we are not bound to follow it, and decline to do so. That being so, we hold that there is no authority which justifies the Rule, and a finding that the mere existence of a conviction for manslaughter is a bar to a trial, or retrial, for murder arising out of the same killing. Result For these reasons we hold that the judge's order was correct and dismiss the appeal.

Clarence Cooper was killed during the course of a burglary of which the appellant, on the prosecution's case, was the master mind. He appeals against his conviction for murder following a reference by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (""CCRC""). At the conclusion of this morning's hearing we announced that the appeal was dismissed. We now give our reasons. We are grateful for the comprehensive analysis of the case in the CCRC's Statement of Reasons. We take the facts from that statement: ""2. On count 2, Mr Webb was jointly convicted with Michael Micklewright of murdering Clarence Cooper (aged 84 years) at Mr Cooper's home in Alexandra Road Walsall. Jason Matthews was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Anthony French was acquitted following the trial judge's ruling on a submission of no case made on his behalf. Evidence was presented that Mr Cooper was murdered during a burglary at his home on the night of 8/9 August 1994. His body was found at around 12:30/12:45pm on 9 August 1994 by a neighbour, Tye Paddock. Mr Cooper had been stabbed 12 times in the neck with a sharp instrument but had died from asphyxia caused by a handkerchief (probably used as a gag) which had been pushed into his mouth. The pathologist, Dr Acland, calculated the time of death as between 11:43pm on 8 August and 5:19am on 9 August 1994. 3. It was the prosecution's case that Mr Webb was the leader of a small gang comprising Jason Matthews, Michael Micklewright, Anthony French and himself, and that he had taught the others (then aged between 16 and 17) how to commit burglaries. This was supported by Mr Webb's own admissions in his police interviews (see below) that he showed the boys how to do ""sleepers"" (burglaries at night), had provided them with the requisite tools and on one occasion had disposed of the stolen goods. Mr Webb also accepted at his interviews that on the night of the murder the gang left his house to commit burglary and were carrying screwdrivers, Stanley knives and an Army knife. He also said in his interview that Mr Micklewright was a ""nutter"". The prosecution contended that the parties had entered into a conspiracy to burgle Mr Cooper's home at night and that Mr Cooper was murdered when he disturbed them. 4. The prosecution unequivocally asserted that Messrs Micklewright, Mathews and French were at Mr Cooper's address on the night in question. As to Mr Webb's role, the case as left to the jury was that Mr Webb might have physically participated in the burglary by entering Mr Cooper's house; that he might have remained outside the premises; or, he might have remained inside his own home having entered into a joint enterprise with the others. The prosecution adduced evidence in support of each of these scenarios. 5. Important evidence against Mr Webb consisted of his alleged ""confessions"" to Darren Cooke and Carol Wallbank, who were living together with Mr Webb in a hostel after the murder had taken place. According to Miss Wallbank and Mr Cooke, Mr Webb told them about the murder of Clarence Cooper almost on a daily basis on occasions between 12th September and 17th October 1994. Miss Wallbank gave evidence that Mr Webb had told her that he went to Mr Cooper's house with the boys to set up the burglary and that he stayed outside whilst the three boys went inside. He heard a smash and the three boys ran out covered in blood. Mr Cooke gave evidence that Mr Webb told him that Mr Micklewright had stabbed Mr Cooper in the throat with a knife or a screwdriver which had come from Mr Webb's house and that somebody had stuffed a handkerchief into Mr Cooper's mouth. In addition Mr Webb told him that he and the boys had all kicked and punched Mr Cooper. Mr Cooke also stated that Mr Webb told him that they stole £100 from Mr Cooper's home and went back to his, Mr Webb's house, where he told the others he could burn their clothes and showed them how to clean themselves. Mr Cooke also gave evidence that Mr Webb told him that he disposed of Mr Micklewright's knife. 6. Victoria Webster gave evidence that she and Gary Matthews (brother of the co-accused Jason Matthews) went to see Mr Webb on 27 August 1994 and Mr Webb told her the following: He could get Jason Mathews off the charges with the police if in return Mr Matthews would tell him what he had told the police about Mr Webb's role. He (Mr Webb) had told the police that Mr Matthews had stayed at his house on the night of the murder. Victoria Webster in her evidence went on to say that Mr Webb told her that Messrs Micklewright and French had gone out with knives and black bags and a handkerchief taken from his drawer and that they murdered Mr Cooper. She also stated that Mr Webb told her that they, Messrs Micklewright and Matthews, deliberately set him up by leaving the handkerchief and the bin liner at Mr Cooper's house. Mr Webb had also told her that the burglars carried an Army knife and another knife which was possibly a Stanley knife. Mr Webb's interviews 7. On 22 August 1994, Mr Webb went voluntarily to Walsall police station and made a witness statement. He was arrested on 24 August 1994 for murder and was interviewed at length. He consistently claimed that during the night of 8/9 August 1994 Messrs Micklewright, French and Matthews left his house at about 1.30am, and, having returned in the early hours, went out again and returned about 4.45am. Mr Webb said that they went out with his two screwdrivers, balaclavas and gloves to commit burglaries. He admitted that he knew Mr Micklewright had an Army and a Stanley knife and that Mr French had a Stanley knife. He admitted that he had shown them how to do ""sleepers"", but denied sending them to Mr Cooper's house. He said that he did not know where Mr Cooper lived. He denied any involvement with Mr. Cooper's death. He said that Messrs Micklewright and French changed their clothes the next day and that he had heard about the murder at the Glebe Centre between 12 and 1pm on 9 August. He also said that Mr Micklewright had told him that they (Messrs Micklewright, French and Matthews) had panicked and stabbed the old man when the lights came on. Joint enterprise . 8. It was the prosecution's case that Mr Webb was the leader, organiser and planner of the defendant's burgling activities generally, and in particular on the night of the murder. The prosecution argued that there was evidence that showed that Mr Webb had organized the burglary at Mr Cooper's home. The prosecution adduced evidence that the defendants carried with them weapons (namely Mr Micklewright's Stanley and Army knives and Mr French's Stanley knife), and two of Mr Webb's screwdrivers. 9. The prosecution said that Mr Webb's knowledge of the weapons, coupled with his view of Mr Micklewright, indicated an awareness of the possibility that an occupier would be seriously injured if the need arose. Substantial argument took place about the law relating to joint enterprise. We add to this summary only the following. The handkerchief probably belonged to the victim and we shall so assume. The pathologist gave the cause of death as asphyxia perhaps aggravated by the neck wounds. It was not clear whether the neck wounds preceded or followed the application of the gag. The appellant chose not to give evidence. It was the respondent's case that the appellant was a party to the murder. Another defendant had pushed the handkerchief into the deceased's mouth causing his death. The judge gave the following direction to the jury to apply to any defendant who did not actually cause the death: ""The prosecution case is that the defendants committed this murder jointly. Where the offence is committed by two or more persons, each of them play a different part, but if they're acting together as part of a joint plan to commit an offence, they are each guilty of it. Before you can convict any of the defendants you must either be sure that he committed the murder himself or that he did an act or acts as part of a joint plan with the other defendants to commit murder. If you are not sure that he was killed by the defendant whose case you are considering you must go on to decide whether the defendant whose case you are considering was a party to a joint enterprise which included either an agreement, tacit or express, involving the intention to kill Clarence Cooper or to cause him really serious bodily harm if the need arose during the course of the burglary; or, without agreeing to such conduct being used, the realisation that Clarence Cooper might be killed or caused really serious bodily harm during the burglary. ... What about B and C who are party to the joint enterprise to burgle the house? The law is that where two or more persons embark on a joint criminal enterprise, in this case burglary, each is liable for the acts done in pursuance of that joint enterprise, and that includes liability for the unusual consequences if they arise from the carrying out of the joint enterprise. However, if one of the burglars goes beyond what had been agreed between them as part of the joint enterprise and does an act which is outside the scope of what has been agreed between them, then the others are not liable for the consequences of that unauthorised act. It is for you to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise or went beyond it and was in fact an act unauthorised by the joint enterprise. ... In any of those situations it is open to you to conclude that the defendant whose case you are considering was a secondary party to the joint enterprise, but you must also be sure that the joint enterprise in which he participated included either an agreement involving an intention to kill Clarence Cooper, or to cause him really serious harm if the need arose during the burglary, or without agreeing to such conduct being used the realisation that Clarence Cooper might be killed or might be caused really serious bodily harm in the course of the burglary. In fact, the way the prosecution put their case is that the secondary parties to the joint enterprise must have realised or contemplated that really serious harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper, and that they nevertheless continued to participate in the burglary. If, therefore, you are sure that one of the three defendants killed Clarence Cooper with the requisite intention for murder, namely to kill or to cause really serious bodily harm, and that the killing occurred during the execution of a joint enterprise which involved the realisation that serious bodily harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper, and if you are sure that the defendant whose case you are considering participated in that joint enterprise with that realisation, then the defendant whose case you are considering will be guilty of murder."" The judge gave the jury some written questions. In so far as relevant to this appeal, they were, as set out by the judge in the summing up: ""Thirdly, are you sure that one of the defendants, other than the defendant whose case you are considering, killed Clarence Cooper with the intention to kill him or to cause him really serious bodily harm? If yes, consider question 5; if no, consider question four. Fourthly, are you sure that one of the defendants, other than the defendant whose case you are considering, killed Clarence Cooper in circumstances that all reasonable and sober people would inevitable realise must subject someone to the risk of some harm although not serious harm? If yes, consider question 7; if no, find him not guilty of murder and manslaughter. Fifthly, are you sure that the defendant whose case you are considering took part in a joint enterprise with the defendant who killed Clarence Cooper to burgle 178 Alexandra Road? If no, find him not guilty of murder and manslaughter. If yes, consider question 6. Sixthly, are you sure that the joint enterprise in which the defendant whose case you are considering took part included the realisation by him that really serious bodily harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper? If yes, find him guilty of murder; if no, consider question 7. Seventhly, are you sure that the joint enterprise in which the defendant whose case you are considering took part involved a realisation by him that some harm might be caused to Clarence Cooper? If yes, find him guilty of manslaughter; if no, find him not guilty of murder and manslaughter. You probably realise by now, members of the jury, why I thought it might be helpful if you were to have those directions in writing so that you can take them out with you and consider them when you retire."" Although the judge in his oral directions told the jury to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise or went beyond it, that was not repeated in the written directions. The trial being conducted prior to the decision of the House of Lords in Powell and English [1997] 1 AC 1 no specific direction was given about the handkerchief. Mr Parker QC who, like Mr Thomas QC, was not counsel at trial concedes rightly that the direction was not in accordance with Powell and English . Given that the appellant was convicted of murder, the jury must have been sure that he participated (in some way) in the burglary of the home of Clarence Cooper and he realised (at the least) that serious bodily harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper during the burglary. The appellant had admitted in his police interviews that he showed the boys how to do ""sleepers"" (burglaries at night), had provided them with the requisite tools and on one occasion had disposed of the stolen goods. Mr Webb also accepted during his interviews that on the night of the murder the gang left his house to commit burglary and were carrying screwdrivers, Stanley knives and an Army knife. He also said in his interview that Micklewright was a ""nutter"". Mr Thomas rightly and importantly conceded that the jury must have concluded that the appellant realised that one or more of the ""weapons"" might be used with the intention of causing (at the least) serious bodily harm to the occupant of the house being burgled. That was how the judge approached the case in his ruling on a submission of no case to answer. Given that the appellant realised (as the jury found) that serious bodily harm might be inflicted on Clarence Cooper during the burglary, he will be guilty of murder if what the killer did was within the scope of the joint enterprise. In Attorney General's Reference under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 No 3 of 2004 [2005] EWCA Crim 1882 , discussed in [2006] Crim L R 63 the Court said this about the scope of a joint enterprise: ""32. Mr Perry concedes (rightly in our view) that the test for whether what the primary party did is within or outside the scope of the joint enterprise requires the application of a subjective test. Did the secondary party foresee the possibility that the primary party would do what he did? It is preferable to define the scope of the joint enterprise in this way rather than by using such language as ""Did the act go beyond what had tacitly been agreed?"" or ""Did he depart from the concerted action of the common design?"". That is established by Powell and English (see e.g. 31C-D). Nor is a test fashioned on the law of causation probably very helpful. Earlier cases which talk of ""must have anticipated"" may also now be ignored. 33. The issue in this case is what does the secondary party have to have foreseen as a possibility? There is no dispute between Mr Perry and Mr Cox that it is an act and in the case of English, as in this case, it is the act which caused the death. Lord Hutton in Powell and English said: 'The first issue is what is the degree of foresight required to impose liability under the principle stated in Chan Wing-Siu [1985] AC 168 . On this issue I am in respectful agreement with the judgment of the Privy Council in that case that the secondary party is subject to criminal liability if he contemplated the act causing the death as a possible incident of the joint venture, unless the risk was so remote that the jury take the view that the secondary party genuinely dismissed it as altogether negligible.'(Underlining added)"". It is clear from Powell and English that it is sufficient if the defendant foresaw an act of the type which the principal party committed . Lord Hutton said, at page 29: ""Mr Sallon, for the appellant, advanced to your Lordships' House the submission (which does not appear to have been advanced in the Court of Appeal) that in a case such as the present one where the primary party kills with a deadly weapon, which the secondary party did not know that he had and therefore did not foresee his use of it, the secondary party should not be guilty of murder. He submitted that to be guilty under the principle stated in Chan Wing-Siu the secondary party must foresee an act of the type which the principle party committed, and that in the present case the use of a knife was fundamentally different to the use of a wooden post. My Lords, I consider that this submission is correct. It finds strong support in the passage of the judgment of Lord Parker C.J. in Reg. v. Anderson; Reg. v. Morris [1966] 2 Q.B. 110, 120 which I have set out earlier, but which it is convenient to set out again in this portion of the judgment: 'It seems to this court that to say that adventurers are guilty of manslaughter when one of them has departed completely form the concerted action of the common design and has suddenly formed an intent to kill and has used a weapon and acted in a way which no party to that common design could suspect is something which would revolt the conscience of people today.'. The judgment in Chan Wing-Siu's case [1985] AC 168 also supports the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant because Sir Robin Cooke stated at p.175: 'The case must depend rather on the wider principle whereby a secondary party is criminally liable for acts by the primary offender of a type which the former foresees but does not necessarily intend.' (Emphasis added.)"" Mr Parker (upon whom we did not call) referred us in his skeleton argument to another passage in Lord Hutton's speech which is to a similar effect (page 30): ""However, I would wish to make this observation: if the weapon used by the primary party is different to, but as dangerous as, the weapon which the secondary party contemplated he might use, the secondary party should not escape liability for murder because of the difference in the weapon, for example, if he foresaw that the primary party might use a gun to kill and the latter used a knife to kill, or vice versa."" Mr Thomas submits that the jury should have been directed that to convict of murder they had to be sure that the appellant had in contemplation the use of a handkerchief or towel as a gag if necessary. That in our view overlooks the fact that it is sufficient if the defendant foresaw an act of the type which the principal party committed. We take the view that, in the light of Powell and English , the jury should have been directed along the following lines on the facts of this case and in the light of the other directions: ""If you are sure that the defendant realised that a screwdriver or knife might be used with the intention of causing (at least) serious bodily harm to Clarence Cooper and if you are sure that the defendant realised that one of the burglars may, with the intention that serious bodily harm be caused to Clarence Cooper (by himself or another), take steps to silence the victim's voice, then he is guilty of murder [the other ingredients being satisfied]."" We know the jury were sure of the first part, namely that the defendant realised that a screwdriver or knife might be used with the intention of causing (at least) serious bodily harm to Clarence Cooper. Mr Thomas, relying on Greatrex [1999] 1 Cr App R 126, submits the second part should have been left to the jury. That not having been done, the appeal must succeed, so he submits. In our view Greatrex was quite different. The fatal blow was delivered by an iron bar to the head. The appellant, on the jury's verdict, was, with others, involved in violently kicking the victim. It was held that it was for the jury to decide whether the use of the iron bar was within the appellant's contemplation and that it was open to the jury on the facts of that case to have decided either way. In this case the ""weapon"" used to cause death was only a handkerchief. Given that the second part of this question should have been left to the jury for their determination, we have to ask whether the conviction is unsafe. In our view, in the light of the admissions made by the appellant, a jury would inevitably have convicted if this direction had been given. We add this. If, in the instant case, the knife wounds had been a substantial cause of death (either medically or because of their disabling effect), then the direction given by the judge may well have satisfied the Powell and English test.

Clarence Cooper was killed during the course of a burglary of which the appellant, on the prosecution's case, was the master mind. He appeals against his conviction for murder following a reference by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (""CCRC""). At the conclusion of this morning's hearing we announced that the appeal was dismissed. We now give our reasons. We are grateful for the comprehensive analysis of the case in the CCRC's Statement of Reasons. We take the facts from that statement: ""2. On count 2, Mr Webb was jointly convicted with Michael Micklewright of murdering Clarence Cooper (aged 84 years) at Mr Cooper's home in Alexandra Road Walsall. Jason Matthews was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Anthony French was acquitted following the trial judge's ruling on a submission of no case made on his behalf. Evidence was presented that Mr Cooper was murdered during a burglary at his home on the night of 8/9 August 1994. His body was found at around 12:30/12:45pm on 9 August 1994 by a neighbour, Tye Paddock. Mr Cooper had been stabbed 12 times in the neck with a sharp instrument but had died from asphyxia caused by a handkerchief (probably used as a gag) which had been pushed into his mouth. The pathologist, Dr Acland, calculated the time of death as between 11:43pm on 8 August and 5:19am on 9 August 1994. 3. It was the prosecution's case that Mr Webb was the leader of a small gang comprising Jason Matthews, Michael Micklewright, Anthony French and himself, and that he had taught the others (then aged between 16 and 17) how to commit burglaries. This was supported by Mr Webb's own admissions in his police interviews (see below) that he showed the boys how to do ""sleepers"" (burglaries at night), had provided them with the requisite tools and on one occasion had disposed of the stolen goods. Mr Webb also accepted at his interviews that on the night of the murder the gang left his house to commit burglary and were carrying screwdrivers, Stanley knives and an Army knife. He also said in his interview that Mr Micklewright was a ""nutter"". The prosecution contended that the parties had entered into a conspiracy to burgle Mr Cooper's home at night and that Mr Cooper was murdered when he disturbed them. 4. The prosecution unequivocally asserted that Messrs Micklewright, Mathews and French were at Mr Cooper's address on the night in question. As to Mr Webb's role, the case as left to the jury was that Mr Webb might have physically participated in the burglary by entering Mr Cooper's house; that he might have remained outside the premises; or, he might have remained inside his own home having entered into a joint enterprise with the others. The prosecution adduced evidence in support of each of these scenarios. 5. Important evidence against Mr Webb consisted of his alleged ""confessions"" to Darren Cooke and Carol Wallbank, who were living together with Mr Webb in a hostel after the murder had taken place. According to Miss Wallbank and Mr Cooke, Mr Webb told them about the murder of Clarence Cooper almost on a daily basis on occasions between 12th September and 17th October 1994. Miss Wallbank gave evidence that Mr Webb had told her that he went to Mr Cooper's house with the boys to set up the burglary and that he stayed outside whilst the three boys went inside. He heard a smash and the three boys ran out covered in blood. Mr Cooke gave evidence that Mr Webb told him that Mr Micklewright had stabbed Mr Cooper in the throat with a knife or a screwdriver which had come from Mr Webb's house and that somebody had stuffed a handkerchief into Mr Cooper's mouth. In addition Mr Webb told him that he and the boys had all kicked and punched Mr Cooper. Mr Cooke also stated that Mr Webb told him that they stole £100 from Mr Cooper's home and went back to his, Mr Webb's house, where he told the others he could burn their clothes and showed them how to clean themselves. Mr Cooke also gave evidence that Mr Webb told him that he disposed of Mr Micklewright's knife. 6. Victoria Webster gave evidence that she and Gary Matthews (brother of the co-accused Jason Matthews) went to see Mr Webb on 27 August 1994 and Mr Webb told her the following: He could get Jason Mathews off the charges with the police if in return Mr Matthews would tell him what he had told the police about Mr Webb's role. He (Mr Webb) had told the police that Mr Matthews had stayed at his house on the night of the murder. Victoria Webster in her evidence went on to say that Mr Webb told her that Messrs Micklewright and French had gone out with knives and black bags and a handkerchief taken from his drawer and that they murdered Mr Cooper. She also stated that Mr Webb told her that they, Messrs Micklewright and Matthews, deliberately set him up by leaving the handkerchief and the bin liner at Mr Cooper's house. Mr Webb had also told her that the burglars carried an Army knife and another knife which was possibly a Stanley knife. Mr Webb's interviews 7. On 22 August 1994, Mr Webb went voluntarily to Walsall police station and made a witness statement. He was arrested on 24 August 1994 for murder and was interviewed at length. He consistently claimed that during the night of 8/9 August 1994 Messrs Micklewright, French and Matthews left his house at about 1.30am, and, having returned in the early hours, went out again and returned about 4.45am. Mr Webb said that they went out with his two screwdrivers, balaclavas and gloves to commit burglaries. He admitted that he knew Mr Micklewright had an Army and a Stanley knife and that Mr French had a Stanley knife. He admitted that he had shown them how to do ""sleepers"", but denied sending them to Mr Cooper's house. He said that he did not know where Mr Cooper lived. He denied any involvement with Mr. Cooper's death. He said that Messrs Micklewright and French changed their clothes the next day and that he had heard about the murder at the Glebe Centre between 12 and 1pm on 9 August. He also said that Mr Micklewright had told him that they (Messrs Micklewright, French and Matthews) had panicked and stabbed the old man when the lights came on. Joint enterprise . 8. It was the prosecution's case that Mr Webb was the leader, organiser and planner of the defendant's burgling activities generally, and in particular on the night of the murder. The prosecution argued that there was evidence that showed that Mr Webb had organized the burglary at Mr Cooper's home. The prosecution adduced evidence that the defendants carried with them weapons (namely Mr Micklewright's Stanley and Army knives and Mr French's Stanley knife), and two of Mr Webb's screwdrivers. 9. The prosecution said that Mr Webb's knowledge of the weapons, coupled with his view of Mr Micklewright, indicated an awareness of the possibility that an occupier would be seriously injured if the need arose. Substantial argument took place about the law relating to joint enterprise. We add to this summary only the following. The handkerchief probably belonged to the victim and we shall so assume. The pathologist gave the cause of death as asphyxia perhaps aggravated by the neck wounds. It was not clear whether the neck wounds preceded or followed the application of the gag. The appellant chose not to give evidence. It was the respondent's case that the appellant was a party to the murder. Another defendant had pushed the handkerchief into the deceased's mouth causing his death. The judge gave the following direction to the jury to apply to any defendant who did not actually cause the death: ""The prosecution case is that the defendants committed this murder jointly. Where the offence is committed by two or more persons, each of them play a different part, but if they're acting together as part of a joint plan to commit an offence, they are each guilty of it. Before you can convict any of the defendants you must either be sure that he committed the murder himself or that he did an act or acts as part of a joint plan with the other defendants to commit murder. If you are not sure that he was killed by the defendant whose case you are considering you must go on to decide whether the defendant whose case you are considering was a party to a joint enterprise which included either an agreement, tacit or express, involving the intention to kill Clarence Cooper or to cause him really serious bodily harm if the need arose during the course of the burglary; or, without agreeing to such conduct being used, the realisation that Clarence Cooper might be killed or caused really serious bodily harm during the burglary. ... What about B and C who are party to the joint enterprise to burgle the house? The law is that where two or more persons embark on a joint criminal enterprise, in this case burglary, each is liable for the acts done in pursuance of that joint enterprise, and that includes liability for the unusual consequences if they arise from the carrying out of the joint enterprise. However, if one of the burglars goes beyond what had been agreed between them as part of the joint enterprise and does an act which is outside the scope of what has been agreed between them, then the others are not liable for the consequences of that unauthorised act. It is for you to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise or went beyond it and was in fact an act unauthorised by the joint enterprise. ... In any of those situations it is open to you to conclude that the defendant whose case you are considering was a secondary party to the joint enterprise, but you must also be sure that the joint enterprise in which he participated included either an agreement involving an intention to kill Clarence Cooper, or to cause him really serious harm if the need arose during the burglary, or without agreeing to such conduct being used the realisation that Clarence Cooper might be killed or might be caused really serious bodily harm in the course of the burglary. In fact, the way the prosecution put their case is that the secondary parties to the joint enterprise must have realised or contemplated that really serious harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper, and that they nevertheless continued to participate in the burglary. If, therefore, you are sure that one of the three defendants killed Clarence Cooper with the requisite intention for murder, namely to kill or to cause really serious bodily harm, and that the killing occurred during the execution of a joint enterprise which involved the realisation that serious bodily harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper, and if you are sure that the defendant whose case you are considering participated in that joint enterprise with that realisation, then the defendant whose case you are considering will be guilty of murder."" The judge gave the jury some written questions. In so far as relevant to this appeal, they were, as set out by the judge in the summing up: ""Thirdly, are you sure that one of the defendants, other than the defendant whose case you are considering, killed Clarence Cooper with the intention to kill him or to cause him really serious bodily harm? If yes, consider question 5; if no, consider question four. Fourthly, are you sure that one of the defendants, other than the defendant whose case you are considering, killed Clarence Cooper in circumstances that all reasonable and sober people would inevitable realise must subject someone to the risk of some harm although not serious harm? If yes, consider question 7; if no, find him not guilty of murder and manslaughter. Fifthly, are you sure that the defendant whose case you are considering took part in a joint enterprise with the defendant who killed Clarence Cooper to burgle 178 Alexandra Road? If no, find him not guilty of murder and manslaughter. If yes, consider question 6. Sixthly, are you sure that the joint enterprise in which the defendant whose case you are considering took part included the realisation by him that really serious bodily harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper? If yes, find him guilty of murder; if no, consider question 7. Seventhly, are you sure that the joint enterprise in which the defendant whose case you are considering took part involved a realisation by him that some harm might be caused to Clarence Cooper? If yes, find him guilty of manslaughter; if no, find him not guilty of murder and manslaughter. You probably realise by now, members of the jury, why I thought it might be helpful if you were to have those directions in writing so that you can take them out with you and consider them when you retire."" Although the judge in his oral directions told the jury to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise or went beyond it, that was not repeated in the written directions. The trial being conducted prior to the decision of the House of Lords in Powell and English [1997] 1 AC 1 no specific direction was given about the handkerchief. Mr Parker QC who, like Mr Thomas QC, was not counsel at trial concedes rightly that the direction was not in accordance with Powell and English . Given that the appellant was convicted of murder, the jury must have been sure that he participated (in some way) in the burglary of the home of Clarence Cooper and he realised (at the least) that serious bodily harm might be intentionally inflicted on Clarence Cooper during the burglary. The appellant had admitted in his police interviews that he showed the boys how to do ""sleepers"" (burglaries at night), had provided them with the requisite tools and on one occasion had disposed of the stolen goods. Mr Webb also accepted during his interviews that on the night of the murder the gang left his house to commit burglary and were carrying screwdrivers, Stanley knives and an Army knife. He also said in his interview that Micklewright was a ""nutter"". Mr Thomas rightly and importantly conceded that the jury must have concluded that the appellant realised that one or more of the ""weapons"" might be used with the intention of causing (at the least) serious bodily harm to the occupant of the house being burgled. That was how the judge approached the case in his ruling on a submission of no case to answer. Given that the appellant realised (as the jury found) that serious bodily harm might be inflicted on Clarence Cooper during the burglary, he will be guilty of murder if what the killer did was within the scope of the joint enterprise. In Attorney General's Reference under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 No 3 of 2004 [2005] EWCA Crim 1882 , discussed in [2006] Crim L R 63 the Court said this about the scope of a joint enterprise: ""32. Mr Perry concedes (rightly in our view) that the test for whether what the primary party did is within or outside the scope of the joint enterprise requires the application of a subjective test. Did the secondary party foresee the possibility that the primary party would do what he did? It is preferable to define the scope of the joint enterprise in this way rather than by using such language as ""Did the act go beyond what had tacitly been agreed?"" or ""Did he depart from the concerted action of the common design?"". That is established by Powell and English (see e.g. 31C-D). Nor is a test fashioned on the law of causation probably very helpful. Earlier cases which talk of ""must have anticipated"" may also now be ignored. 33. The issue in this case is what does the secondary party have to have foreseen as a possibility? There is no dispute between Mr Perry and Mr Cox that it is an act and in the case of English, as in this case, it is the act which caused the death. Lord Hutton in Powell and English said: 'The first issue is what is the degree of foresight required to impose liability under the principle stated in Chan Wing-Siu [1985] AC 168 . On this issue I am in respectful agreement with the judgment of the Privy Council in that case that the secondary party is subject to criminal liability if he contemplated the act causing the death as a possible incident of the joint venture, unless the risk was so remote that the jury take the view that the secondary party genuinely dismissed it as altogether negligible.'(Underlining added)"". It is clear from Powell and English that it is sufficient if the defendant foresaw an act of the type which the principal party committed . Lord Hutton said, at page 29: ""Mr Sallon, for the appellant, advanced to your Lordships' House the submission (which does not appear to have been advanced in the Court of Appeal) that in a case such as the present one where the primary party kills with a deadly weapon, which the secondary party did not know that he had and therefore did not foresee his use of it, the secondary party should not be guilty of murder. He submitted that to be guilty under the principle stated in Chan Wing-Siu the secondary party must foresee an act of the type which the principle party committed, and that in the present case the use of a knife was fundamentally different to the use of a wooden post. My Lords, I consider that this submission is correct. It finds strong support in the passage of the judgment of Lord Parker C.J. in Reg. v. Anderson; Reg. v. Morris [1966] 2 Q.B. 110, 120 which I have set out earlier, but which it is convenient to set out again in this portion of the judgment: 'It seems to this court that to say that adventurers are guilty of manslaughter when one of them has departed completely form the concerted action of the common design and has suddenly formed an intent to kill and has used a weapon and acted in a way which no party to that common design could suspect is something which would revolt the conscience of people today.'. The judgment in Chan Wing-Siu's case [1985] AC 168 also supports the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant because Sir Robin Cooke stated at p.175: 'The case must depend rather on the wider principle whereby a secondary party is criminally liable for acts by the primary offender of a type which the former foresees but does not necessarily intend.' (Emphasis added.)"" Mr Parker (upon whom we did not call) referred us in his skeleton argument to another passage in Lord Hutton's speech which is to a similar effect (page 30): ""However, I would wish to make this observation: if the weapon used by the primary party is different to, but as dangerous as, the weapon which the secondary party contemplated he might use, the secondary party should not escape liability for murder because of the difference in the weapon, for example, if he foresaw that the primary party might use a gun to kill and the latter used a knife to kill, or vice versa."" Mr Thomas submits that the jury should have been directed that to convict of murder they had to be sure that the appellant had in contemplation the use of a handkerchief or towel as a gag if necessary. That in our view overlooks the fact that it is sufficient if the defendant foresaw an act of the type which the principal party committed. We take the view that, in the light of Powell and English , the jury should have been directed along the following lines on the facts of this case and in the light of the other directions: ""If you are sure that the defendant realised that a screwdriver or knife might be used with the intention of causing (at least) serious bodily harm to Clarence Cooper and if you are sure that the defendant realised that one of the burglars may, with the intention that serious bodily harm be caused to Clarence Cooper (by himself or another), take steps to silence the victim's voice, then he is guilty of murder ."" We know the jury were sure of the first part, namely that the defendant realised that a screwdriver or knife might be used with the intention of causing (at least) serious bodily harm to Clarence Cooper. Mr Thomas, relying on Greatrex [1999] 1 Cr App R 126, submits the second part should have been left to the jury. That not having been done, the appeal must succeed, so he submits. In our view Greatrex was quite different. The fatal blow was delivered by an iron bar to the head. The appellant, on the jury's verdict, was, with others, involved in violently kicking the victim. It was held that it was for the jury to decide whether the use of the iron bar was within the appellant's contemplation and that it was open to the jury on the facts of that case to have decided either way. In this case the ""weapon"" used to cause death was only a handkerchief. Given that the second part of this question should have been left to the jury for their determination, we have to ask whether the conviction is unsafe. In our view, in the light of the admissions made by the appellant, a jury would inevitably have convicted if this direction had been given. We add this. If, in the instant case, the knife wounds had been a substantial cause of death (either medically or because of their disabling effect), then the direction given by the judge may well have satisfied the Powell and English test."

LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE: On 2nd January 2018 at the Central Criminal Court, Theodore Johnson pleaded guilty to the murder of his former partner, Miss Angela Best. On 5th January 2018 he was sentenced by the Common Serjeant, His Honour Judge Marks QC to life imprisonment. The learned judge specified the minimum term to be served as one of 26 years, less the 350 days which Mr Johnson had spent on remand in custody. Pursuant to section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, Her Majesty's Solicitor General now seeks leave to refer the case to this court so that it may review the sentencing and determine whether it was unduly lenient. We grant leave. Miss Best was murdered on 15th December 2016. Before summarising the circumstances of her murder, it is necessary to consider events which occurred many years ago, for it is a striking and unusual feature of the case that the murder of Miss Best was the third occasion on which Mr Johnson has committed a crime of homicide. In May 1981, Mr Johnson killed his then wife, Yvonne. They were living, together with their two young children, in a ninth floor flat. The relationship had become unhappy. On the day of Mrs Johnson's death they argued and began to fight. It was Mr Johnson's case, which must have been accepted by the jury as at least possibly true, that the fight broke out because Mrs Johnson struck him with a broom. He struck her with an ashtray and a vase. The fight moved out onto a balcony, from which he pushed her to her death. He was tried for murder. The jury returned a verdict that he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the ground of provocation. Mr Johnson was sentenced, in accordance with the level of sentence which at that time was regarded as appropriate, to three years' imprisonment. Following his release from that sentence Mr Johnson began a relationship with a Miss Bennett. A child was born to them. By 1992 however the relationship had broken down and Miss Bennett wished to separate. Following police intervention, Mr Johnson left for a time but then returned to the home. There on 20th September 1992 the couple argued, and eventually a fight began. Mr Johnson strangled Miss Bennett using a belt as a ligature. Having killed her, he made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide. Mr Johnson was again prosecuted for murder. Psychiatric reports commissioned by both prosecution and defence concluded that at the material time he was suffering from a severe depressive illness, coupled with a personality disorder, and that his responsibility for the killing was substantially impaired. The prosecution accepted Mr Johnson's plea that he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility. In 1993 a Hospital Order combined with a restriction order without limitation of time was made. Mr Johnson remained in hospital for many years. In the mid-1990s he was granted temporary leave from hospital for rehabilitation purposes and permitted to attend a training course. There he met Miss Best. He was then in his early forties and she was some 12 years younger. In May 1996 a Mental Health Review Tribunal concluded that at that stage it was not safe for Mr Johnson to be discharged from hospital. The Tribunal found that if he did not comply with a condition requiring him to disclose any relationship, there would be a serious risk to any woman who became involved in a relationship with him should Mr Johnson suffer further episodes of depression, as he was expected to do. The Tribunal concluded that at that stage the assessment of the outcome of imposing a condition of that nature was fraught with difficulty and that, having regard to the serious danger which Mr Johnson potentially represented to women in the future, it would at that stage be taking an unjustified risk to release him from hospital. By 1997, however, it was felt that Mr Johnson could be discharged from hospital provided he could be trusted to be frank and open with his care team about developing relationships. A conclusion must have been reached that he could so be trusted, for in October of that year he was granted a conditional discharge from the Hospital Order. One of the conditions of his discharge required him ""to disclose to both his medical and social work supervisor any relationships with women and accept that such disclosure will involve his past history being communicated to such a person."" Within a few years of his being released from hospital, Mr Johnson began a relationship with Miss Best although they never cohabited. In plain breach of the important condition to which we have referred, he failed to disclose the fact of that relationship to any of the persons involved in his care and supervision. On the contrary, he positively denied to them that he had or contemplated having any relationship with a woman. This situation persisted over many years. Mr Johnson's relationship with Miss Best ended in the autumn of 2016, when she met someone else. Mr Johnson could not or would not accept that his relationship with Miss Best was at an end and repeatedly begged her to take him back. She did not wish any resumption of the relationship. Pausing there, the medical evidence indicates that in the years since his conditional discharge from the hospital order, Mr Johnson had remained vulnerable to episodes of depressive illness. The annual care plans prepared in relation to him noted that the early warning signs of a relapse into depression included weight loss, poor self-care and poor appetite. In the weeks leading up to the killing of Miss Best, those familiar with Mr Johnson noted that he was not eating and was losing weight. On 8th December 2016, he told a doctor that he was feeling lonely and that he had been thinking a lot about how things had never gone right in his life. A further appointment was arranged for him to be seen a few days later. Mr Johnson attended that appointment, but unfortunately the doctor was unwell and so the appointment was re-arranged. On 15th December 2016, Miss Best kindly agreed to go to Mr Johnson's house to help him complete an application form, that being something which he found difficult to do without assistance. As the learned judge was to observe in passing sentence, it was a measure of Miss Best that she was still willing to spend time offering her assistance to Mr Johnson. An argument began between them. In his sentencing remarks the learned judge noted that it was unclear how or why that argument began, but felt it highly likely that Mr Johnson became angry about her unwillingness to go back to him and jealous of her new relationship. He then attacked her in a brutal fashion. He struck at least six forceful blows to her head with a claw hammer. He fractured a bone in her hand as she tried to protect herself against that attack. He then strangled her to death with a dressing gown cord, using sufficient force to fracture her hyoid bone. He must have caused her terrible pain and suffering in the last moments of her life. By that dreadful murder he not only ended the life of Miss Best, but he also caused continuing anguish to her family and friends. Victim personal statements provided to the judge, which we too have read, make it clear that Miss Best was an exceptional woman, that her family have been destroyed and devastated by the murder and that the family will never be the same again. We have the contents of those statements well in mind and we offer our sympathy to the bereaved. They will understand, we are sure, that in determining the outcome of this application we cannot and do not in any sense seek to value either the life of Miss Best or the suffering of the bereaved. Following the murder, Mr Johnson left the house without alerting the emergency services. Later that day at a railway station he threw himself in front of a train in an attempt to end his own life. He survived, but as a result of the injuries which he sustained his right arm has been amputated below the shoulder and his left arm has been amputated at the wrist. At a hearing on 22nd May 2017 he plead not guilty to the charge of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility. That plea was not accepted by the prosecution. The trial date was fixed for 2nd January 2018. Both defence and prosecution commissioned medical reports. The former provided support for the partial defence of diminished responsibility. The latter did not. On the day of the trial, and as the jury was about to be sworn, Mr Johnson volunteered from the dock that he wished to plead guilty to murder. We are told, and have no reason to doubt, that his decision to do so was in large part prompted by a desire to spare the bereaved family the ordeal of a trial. After an appropriate adjournment so that he could be advised, Mr Johnson duly entered that plea and sentence was adjourned to 5th January 2018. Mr Johnson was born on 25th December 1953 and so is now 64 years old. In addition to the history of depressive illness, to which we have referred, he suffers from diabetes and glaucoma. As a result of the injuries sustained in his attempted suicide he is now largely dependent upon others for many of the activities of daily living. It is clear from the learned judge's detailed sentencing remarks that he gave careful consideration to the determination of the appropriate minimum term. He considered, as he was bound to do, the provisions of schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. He rejected a defence submission that under that schedule the appropriate starting point was one of 15 years. He concluded that the seriousness of the offence was particularly high, such that the appropriate starting point was one of 30 years. In reaching that conclusion he said he took account of three factors, which he explained as follows: ""The attack perpetrated by you upon Angela Best was sustained, vicious and utterly brutal. She suffered an unimaginably terrible death, and as I have already observed, there can be no doubt whatsoever that you intended to kill her. This is the third occasion when you have killed a female partner, albeit I note and take into account the fact that the two previous occasions were many years ago, and as I have already observed, resulted in convictions for manslaughter and not murder. Such repeated offending resulting in three separate court cases must be almost unprecedented. As I have already observed, the lies that you repeatedly told those who were supervising your conditional discharge, concealing from them that you were in a new relationship and thus depriving them of the opportunity of telling your partner about your past, is an extremely serious aggravating feature. If I am wrong about regarding this as being a case where the appropriate starting point is 30 years and the correct starting point is in fact 15 years, so serious are the factors to which I have just made reference that it would necessitate a very substantial increase from that 15 year figure such that the end figure would not in my judgment be any different."" The learned judge then went on to deal with matters of mitigation. He identified four: Mr Johnson's age, coupled with his serious ill-health and disability, which collectively made it almost unthinkable that he would be in a position to commit a further offence in the future; the absence of any premeditation; the history of mental ill-health and the evidence that at the time of the murder Mr Johnson had been in a low mood for some time and may very well have been in the early stages of a relapse into a depressive illness; and the guilty plea. As to the guilty plea, the learned judge noted that in the ordinary way no more than a five per cent reduction could be made for such a late guilty plea to murder. He indicated however that he was willing to allow a marginally greater discount than that, because Mr Johnson had chosen, albeit extremely late in the day, not to put before the jury a defence for which there was some expert support. We are grateful to counsel for their written and oral submissions which we can encapsulate in this way. Her Majesty's Solicitor General submits that the sentence was unduly lenient because it failed to mark the gravity of the offending, the need to protect the public from harm and public concern about cases of this kind. In his primary submission he particularly argues that the learned judge should have regarded the case as being one of exceptionally high seriousness and should therefore have ordered that the early release provision ought not to apply in this case. In the alternative, he submits, having regard to the previous convictions for manslaughter, the learned judge should have concluded that the starting point must be increased well above 30 years and should further have concluded that even after making appropriate allowance for the mitigation, the minimum term should have been significantly in excess of 30 years. On behalf of Mr Johnson, Miss Henry QC submits that the learned judge took a perfectly proper approach to the application of schedule 21 to the complex circumstances of this case and that the minimum term of 26 years cannot be said to be unduly lenient or ""much too low"". She submits that the suggestion that the experienced judge, after a careful assessment, passed a sentence which was ""much too low"" is difficult to reconcile with the blunt fact of a 26 year minimum term. She emphasises the history of depressive illness and the indications that Mr Johnson was relapsing into a further episode of depressive illness in the days leading up to the murder of Miss Best. She urges the court not inappropriately to undervalue that mitigation. In reflecting upon those submissions we start by considering the statutory framework applicable to this case. The determination as to what punishment is just and proportionate in the circumstances of a particular offence necessarily involves a determination of the seriousness of that offence. So far as material for present purposes, section 143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides as follows: ""143 Determining the seriousness of an offence (1) In considering the seriousness of any offence, the court must consider the offender's culpability in committing the offence and any harm which the offence caused, was intended to cause or might foreseeably have caused. (2) In considering the seriousness of an offence ('the current offence') committed by an offender who has one or more previous convictions, the court must treat each previous conviction as an aggravating factor if (in the case of that conviction) the court considers that it can reasonably be so treated having regard, in particular, to (a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence, and (b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction."" The sentence for murder is fixed by law. It is one of life imprisonment. The effect of section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is that a court when imposing a mandatory life sentence for murder must specify the minimum term which must elapse before the early release provisions (in other words the provisions relating to release on licence) can apply. The minimum term is the period which the court considers appropriate, taking into account the seriousness of the offence. If the court is of the opinion that because of the seriousness of the offence the early release provisions should not apply to the offender, section 269(4) requires the court so to order. That is commonly referred to as a whole life order. Section 269(5) requires the court in considering the seriousness of the offence to have regard to the general principles set out in schedule 21. Paragraph 4 of schedule 21 provides: ""(1) If (a) the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is exceptionally high, and (b) the offender was aged 21 or over when he committed the offence, The appropriate starting point is a whole life order. (2) Cases that would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include (a) the murder of two or more persons, where each murder involves any of the following (i) a substantial degree of premeditation or planning, (ii) the abduction of the victim, or (iii) sexual or sadistic conduct, (b) the murder of a child if involving the abduction of the child or sexual or sadistic motivation, (c) a murder done for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, or (d) a murder by an offender previously convicted of murder."" Paragraph 5 provides: ""(1) If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when he committed the offence, The appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years. (2) Cases that (if not falling within paragraph 4(1)) would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include (a) the murder of a police officer or prison officer in the course of his duty, (b) a murder involving the use of a firearm or explosive, (c) a murder done for gain (such as a murder done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary, done for payment or done in the expectation of gain as a result of the death), (d) a murder intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice, (e) a murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct, (f) the murder of two or more persons, (g) a murder that is racially or religiously aggravated or aggravated by sexual orientation, or (h) a murder falling within paragraph 4(2) committed by an offender who was aged under 21 when he committed the offence."" Paragraph 8 of schedule 21 provides: ""8 Having chosen a starting point, the court should take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors, to the extent that it has not allowed for them in its choice of starting point."" Consideration of those features may lead the court to adjust the starting point either upwards or downwards. Paragraphs 10 and 11 set out non-exhaustive lists of potential aggravating and mitigating factors. It should be noted that one of the potential mitigating factors is a lack of premeditation. When a court does not make a whole life order, but specifies a minimum term, that means precisely what it says. It is the minimum number of years which must pass before the murderer can even be considered for release on licence. Even when the minimum term expires, release on licence does not follow immediately or as a matter of course. The Parole Board must decide whether the protection of the public requires the continued detention of the murderer and will only release him when it is satisfied that it is safe to do so. Those features of a life sentence for murder provide the public with the necessary protection for the future. Thus the minimum term is intended to be the term which is appropriate by way of punishment and retribution. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for a court to increase that term in order to protect the public. We must next mention some features of relevant case law. So far as a whole life order is concerned, in Jones and others [2006] 2 CrAppR (S) 19 , at paragraph 10, the Lord Chief Justice said of a whole life order: "" Often, perhaps usually, where such an order is called for the case will not be on the borderline. The facts of the case, considered as a whole, will leave the judge in no doubt that the offender must be kept in prison for the rest of his or her life."" In Oakes and others [2013] QB 679, Lord Judge, LCJ, said at paragraph 12, that the decision as to whether a whole life order is necessary is therefore a discretionary aspect of the judge's sentencing decision. At paragraph 29 he said that such an order ""is reserved for the few exceptionally serious offences in which, after reflecting on all the features of aggravation and mitigation, the judge is satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the imposition of a whole life order. If that conclusion is justified, the whole life order is appropriate: but only then. It is not a mandatory or automatic or minimum sentence."" Those well-established principles have been reiterated in more recent cases. In Reynolds [2015] 1 CrAppR (S) 24 , at paragraph 5, Lord Thomas, LCJ emphasised that the guidance in schedule 21 is provided to assist the judge to determine the appropriate sentence, that each case will depend critically on its particular facts and that the court should take into account consideration the fact of a guilty plea to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term. Turning now to the provisions of paragraph 5 of schedule 21, this court in Khaleel [2013] 1 Cr.App.R (S) 122, rejected a submission that the court was bound to adopt a 15-year starting point in any case which fell outside the specific identified criteria in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the schedule. The court held that the sentencer must make a judgment as to the seriousness of the offence, and may properly find the case to be of exceptionally high or particularly high seriousness even though it cannot be brought within the specific circumstances listed in paragraphs 4 and 5. A previous conviction for manslaughter may lead a judge to treat a subsequent offence of murder as an offence of particularly high seriousness. In the circumstances of that case, the sentencing judge had been entitled to conclude that an offence of murder committed while the offender was on licence from a sentence of eight years' imprisonment imposed for manslaughter, was an offence of particularly high seriousness and that the 30-year starting point should apply. However, in all the circumstances of that case, ""that conclusion would have reflected all the relevant aggravating features."" As to the age/or ill-health of an offender, this court in Clarke [2017] 2 CrAppR (S) 18 made clear that these are factors which should be taken into account in a limited way. The focus of the court should be on the extent to which a custodial sentence will be more onerous than in the case of a younger, fitter offender. At paragraph 25 the Vice President, Hallett LJ said: ""Whilst we consider that an offender's diminished life expectancy, his age, health and the prospect of dying in prison are factors legitimately to be taken into account in passing sentence, they have to be balanced against the gravity of the offending, (including the harm done to victims), and the public interest in setting appropriate punishment for very serious crimes."" We have applied those principles in reaching our decision in these this case. Of the three points specifically relied upon by the Solicitor General, it seems to us that our focus must be on the gravity of Mr Johnson's crime. The need to protect the public from harm is, as we have indicated, catered for by the nature and the effect of the mandatory life sentence. The reference to public concern about cases of this kind is, as we see it, an aspect of the gravity of the offending. The learned judge did not regard this as a case in which a whole life order was necessary. That was not of course a conclusion that this is anything other than a very serious case, but rather a conclusion that it is not one of the rare and exceptional cases in which such an order is necessary. As the authorities to which we have referred make clear, that is a discretionary decision. We must therefore consider whether it can be said that the sentence was unduly lenient because in all the circumstances it was not properly open to the judge reasonably to conclude that a whole life order was unnecessary. In our judgment, it plainly was open to him reasonably to reach that conclusion as he did. Having regard to Mr Johnson's age and disability, to his guilty plea and to all the circumstances of the case, the learned judge was entitled to conclude that a long minimum term constituted just punishment and retribution for this dreadful crime. We are therefore unable to accept the submission of the Solicitor General that the judge was bound to impose a whole life order. As to the determination of the minimum term, it is in our view clear from the passage in the sentencing remarks which we have quoted that the learned judge regarded the aggravating factors which he identified as collectively making this a case of particularly high seriousness, so that the 30 year minimum term was the appropriate starting point. Having taken all of the aggravating features of the case into account in reaching that decision, he did not then find any further aggravating feature which required him to add to that minimum term. It followed that the effect of the mitigating factors and of the guilty plea was to reduce the sentence below the 30-year starting point. It was in that way that he reached his decision that the appropriate minimum term was one of 26 years. The key question, as it seems to us, is whether that approach was unduly lenient. We naturally hesitate to differ from the assessment made by a highly experienced judge and we acknowledge the force of many of the points made to him and to us by Miss Henry. Nonetheless, and with all respect to the learned judge, we conclude that he did fall into error. Paragraph 8 of schedule 21 requires the court to take account of aggravating factors to the extent that it has not allowed for them in deciding the appropriate minimum term. The judge here correctly identified the aggravating factors and rightly observed that it must be well-nigh unprecedented for an offender to plead guilty to murder having twice previously been charged with murder and convicted of manslaughter. In our judgment, however, he fell into error in his assessment of the weight to be given to those factors, individually and collectively, in determining the seriousness of the offence of murder. It must be remembered that the two previous convictions were for voluntary manslaughter in circumstances where all the ingredients of the offence of murder were proved or admitted but one of the partial defences was successfully invoked. Moreover, the first offence of manslaughter was a case of provocation, not a case in which Mr Johnson's mental health was relevant to the verdict. In our view, the passage of many years since those convictions does not significantly reduce the extent to which they aggravate the seriousness of the present crime. In addition, we agree with the learned judge that Mr Johnson's breach of the condition of his discharge from hospital was a gravely aggravating feature. The obvious purpose of that condition was to safeguard any women with whom Mr Johnson formed or tried to form a relationship. We find nothing in the evidence about Mr Johnson's mental health problems to suggest that he was not fully aware of the importance of the condition. We are unable to accept Miss Henry's submission that it was in some way inappropriate to leave a person with a history of mental health problems to self-report, as this condition required him to do. We have referred to the two assessments which preceded his discharge and to the assessment made at that time that he could be trusted to self-report about this matter. Against that background, Mr Johnson deliberately breached the requirement, not only by failing to disclose relationships to those whom he should have told, but by actively concealing the fact of his relationship with Miss Best when they asked him questions in general terms about any relationship. The awful reality, as it seems to us, is that Miss Best may well have been alive today if Mr Johnson had complied with that important requirement of his conditional discharge from hospital. It is not for us to speculate as to whether she would ever have begun a relationship with Mr Johnson in the first place if she had then known of his true history, but if appropriately advised and warned she would surely at the very least have been on her guard for signs indicative of a decline on his part towards depression, with the associated increase in the risk to her safety. In our view, the combination of the first manslaughter conviction and the brutal circumstances of this murder of a woman who had gone to Mr Johnson's home trusting that he would behave properly towards her, should, without more, have caused the judge to regard this as a case of particularly high seriousness. So too should the combination of two previous convictions for manslaughter followed by the murder of a third woman with whom he had been in a relationship. It follows that in our view the judge should have concluded that the appropriate starting point was 30 years, even without taking into account all three of the factors which he identified. He should then have regarded those features which he had not already taken into account as necessitating an increase from the starting point. We agree with Miss Henry that the judge in such a situation must not count the same factor twice; but that does not mean that the judge must simply look to all the factors collectively in reaching the 30-year starting point, without also considering whether that starting point is reached even before they are all taken into account. Thus in our judgment, with respect to the learned judge, he failed to give sufficient weight individually and collectively to all three factors. In our judgment, notwithstanding Mr Johnson's age and disability, those factors necessitated not only a starting point of 30 years but also a significant increase in that starting point. We conclude that after a trial, but before consideration of personal mitigation, the appropriate minimum term would have been one of 35 years. We give rather greater weight to the personal mitigation than did the learned judge. We do so principally because imprisonment will undoubtedly be very much harder for Mr Johnson as an aging man, largely dependent upon the assistance of others, than for a younger prisoner in better health. We accept Miss Henry's submission that the marginal adjustment to the conventional reduction for a guilty plea was one which the judge was entitled to make. In all the circumstances of the case, it seems to us that the combined effect of the personal mitigation, followed by appropriate credit for the late guilty plea, is to reduce the minimum term of 35 years which we have mentioned to one of 30 years. For those reasons, we accept the submission of the Solicitor General that the sentencing of Mr Johnson was unduly lenient. By treating all of the aggravating features of the case as collectively necessitating a starting point of 30 years, but not as necessitating an increase above that starting point, the learned judge failed fully to reflect the true seriousness of this crime. We therefore quash the minimum term of 26 years imposed below and we substitute for it a minimum term of 30 years. As before, 358 days spent on remand in custody will count towards that minimum term.

LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE: On 2nd January 2018 at the Central Criminal Court, Theodore Johnson pleaded guilty to the murder of his former partner, Miss Angela Best. On 5th January 2018 he was sentenced by the Common Serjeant, His Honour Judge Marks QC to life imprisonment. The learned judge specified the minimum term to be served as one of 26 years, less the 350 days which Mr Johnson had spent on remand in custody. Pursuant to section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, Her Majesty's Solicitor General now seeks leave to refer the case to this court so that it may review the sentencing and determine whether it was unduly lenient. We grant leave. Miss Best was murdered on 15th December 2016. Before summarising the circumstances of her murder, it is necessary to consider events which occurred many years ago, for it is a striking and unusual feature of the case that the murder of Miss Best was the third occasion on which Mr Johnson has committed a crime of homicide. In May 1981, Mr Johnson killed his then wife, Yvonne. They were living, together with their two young children, in a ninth floor flat. The relationship had become unhappy. On the day of Mrs Johnson's death they argued and began to fight. It was Mr Johnson's case, which must have been accepted by the jury as at least possibly true, that the fight broke out because Mrs Johnson struck him with a broom. He struck her with an ashtray and a vase. The fight moved out onto a balcony, from which he pushed her to her death. He was tried for murder. The jury returned a verdict that he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the ground of provocation. Mr Johnson was sentenced, in accordance with the level of sentence which at that time was regarded as appropriate, to three years' imprisonment. Following his release from that sentence Mr Johnson began a relationship with a Miss Bennett. A child was born to them. By 1992 however the relationship had broken down and Miss Bennett wished to separate. Following police intervention, Mr Johnson left for a time but then returned to the home. There on 20th September 1992 the couple argued, and eventually a fight began. Mr Johnson strangled Miss Bennett using a belt as a ligature. Having killed her, he made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide. Mr Johnson was again prosecuted for murder. Psychiatric reports commissioned by both prosecution and defence concluded that at the material time he was suffering from a severe depressive illness, coupled with a personality disorder, and that his responsibility for the killing was substantially impaired. The prosecution accepted Mr Johnson's plea that he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility. In 1993 a Hospital Order combined with a restriction order without limitation of time was made. Mr Johnson remained in hospital for many years. In the mid-1990s he was granted temporary leave from hospital for rehabilitation purposes and permitted to attend a training course. There he met Miss Best. He was then in his early forties and she was some 12 years younger. In May 1996 a Mental Health Review Tribunal concluded that at that stage it was not safe for Mr Johnson to be discharged from hospital. The Tribunal found that if he did not comply with a condition requiring him to disclose any relationship, there would be a serious risk to any woman who became involved in a relationship with him should Mr Johnson suffer further episodes of depression, as he was expected to do. The Tribunal concluded that at that stage the assessment of the outcome of imposing a condition of that nature was fraught with difficulty and that, having regard to the serious danger which Mr Johnson potentially represented to women in the future, it would at that stage be taking an unjustified risk to release him from hospital. By 1997, however, it was felt that Mr Johnson could be discharged from hospital provided he could be trusted to be frank and open with his care team about developing relationships. A conclusion must have been reached that he could so be trusted, for in October of that year he was granted a conditional discharge from the Hospital Order. One of the conditions of his discharge required him ""to disclose to both his medical and social work supervisor any relationships with women and accept that such disclosure will involve his past history being communicated to such a person."" Within a few years of his being released from hospital, Mr Johnson began a relationship with Miss Best although they never cohabited. In plain breach of the important condition to which we have referred, he failed to disclose the fact of that relationship to any of the persons involved in his care and supervision. On the contrary, he positively denied to them that he had or contemplated having any relationship with a woman. This situation persisted over many years. Mr Johnson's relationship with Miss Best ended in the autumn of 2016, when she met someone else. Mr Johnson could not or would not accept that his relationship with Miss Best was at an end and repeatedly begged her to take him back. She did not wish any resumption of the relationship. Pausing there, the medical evidence indicates that in the years since his conditional discharge from the hospital order, Mr Johnson had remained vulnerable to episodes of depressive illness. The annual care plans prepared in relation to him noted that the early warning signs of a relapse into depression included weight loss, poor self-care and poor appetite. In the weeks leading up to the killing of Miss Best, those familiar with Mr Johnson noted that he was not eating and was losing weight. On 8th December 2016, he told a doctor that he was feeling lonely and that he had been thinking a lot about how things had never gone right in his life. A further appointment was arranged for him to be seen a few days later. Mr Johnson attended that appointment, but unfortunately the doctor was unwell and so the appointment was re-arranged. On 15th December 2016, Miss Best kindly agreed to go to Mr Johnson's house to help him complete an application form, that being something which he found difficult to do without assistance. As the learned judge was to observe in passing sentence, it was a measure of Miss Best that she was still willing to spend time offering her assistance to Mr Johnson. An argument began between them. In his sentencing remarks the learned judge noted that it was unclear how or why that argument began, but felt it highly likely that Mr Johnson became angry about her unwillingness to go back to him and jealous of her new relationship. He then attacked her in a brutal fashion. He struck at least six forceful blows to her head with a claw hammer. He fractured a bone in her hand as she tried to protect herself against that attack. He then strangled her to death with a dressing gown cord, using sufficient force to fracture her hyoid bone. He must have caused her terrible pain and suffering in the last moments of her life. By that dreadful murder he not only ended the life of Miss Best, but he also caused continuing anguish to her family and friends. Victim personal statements provided to the judge, which we too have read, make it clear that Miss Best was an exceptional woman, that her family have been destroyed and devastated by the murder and that the family will never be the same again. We have the contents of those statements well in mind and we offer our sympathy to the bereaved. They will understand, we are sure, that in determining the outcome of this application we cannot and do not in any sense seek to value either the life of Miss Best or the suffering of the bereaved. Following the murder, Mr Johnson left the house without alerting the emergency services. Later that day at a railway station he threw himself in front of a train in an attempt to end his own life. He survived, but as a result of the injuries which he sustained his right arm has been amputated below the shoulder and his left arm has been amputated at the wrist. At a hearing on 22nd May 2017 he plead not guilty to the charge of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility. That plea was not accepted by the prosecution. The trial date was fixed for 2nd January 2018. Both defence and prosecution commissioned medical reports. The former provided support for the partial defence of diminished responsibility. The latter did not. On the day of the trial, and as the jury was about to be sworn, Mr Johnson volunteered from the dock that he wished to plead guilty to murder. We are told, and have no reason to doubt, that his decision to do so was in large part prompted by a desire to spare the bereaved family the ordeal of a trial. After an appropriate adjournment so that he could be advised, Mr Johnson duly entered that plea and sentence was adjourned to 5th January 2018. Mr Johnson was born on 25th December 1953 and so is now 64 years old. In addition to the history of depressive illness, to which we have referred, he suffers from diabetes and glaucoma. As a result of the injuries sustained in his attempted suicide he is now largely dependent upon others for many of the activities of daily living. It is clear from the learned judge's detailed sentencing remarks that he gave careful consideration to the determination of the appropriate minimum term. He considered, as he was bound to do, the provisions of schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. He rejected a defence submission that under that schedule the appropriate starting point was one of 15 years. He concluded that the seriousness of the offence was particularly high, such that the appropriate starting point was one of 30 years. In reaching that conclusion he said he took account of three factors, which he explained as follows: ""The attack perpetrated by you upon Angela Best was sustained, vicious and utterly brutal. She suffered an unimaginably terrible death, and as I have already observed, there can be no doubt whatsoever that you intended to kill her. This is the third occasion when you have killed a female partner, albeit I note and take into account the fact that the two previous occasions were many years ago, and as I have already observed, resulted in convictions for manslaughter and not murder. Such repeated offending resulting in three separate court cases must be almost unprecedented. As I have already observed, the lies that you repeatedly told those who were supervising your conditional discharge, concealing from them that you were in a new relationship and thus depriving them of the opportunity of telling your partner about your past, is an extremely serious aggravating feature. If I am wrong about regarding this as being a case where the appropriate starting point is 30 years and the correct starting point is in fact 15 years, so serious are the factors to which I have just made reference that it would necessitate a very substantial increase from that 15 year figure such that the end figure would not in my judgment be any different."" The learned judge then went on to deal with matters of mitigation. He identified four: Mr Johnson's age, coupled with his serious ill-health and disability, which collectively made it almost unthinkable that he would be in a position to commit a further offence in the future; the absence of any premeditation; the history of mental ill-health and the evidence that at the time of the murder Mr Johnson had been in a low mood for some time and may very well have been in the early stages of a relapse into a depressive illness; and the guilty plea. As to the guilty plea, the learned judge noted that in the ordinary way no more than a five per cent reduction could be made for such a late guilty plea to murder. He indicated however that he was willing to allow a marginally greater discount than that, because Mr Johnson had chosen, albeit extremely late in the day, not to put before the jury a defence for which there was some expert support. We are grateful to counsel for their written and oral submissions which we can encapsulate in this way. Her Majesty's Solicitor General submits that the sentence was unduly lenient because it failed to mark the gravity of the offending, the need to protect the public from harm and public concern about cases of this kind. In his primary submission he particularly argues that the learned judge should have regarded the case as being one of exceptionally high seriousness and should therefore have ordered that the early release provision ought not to apply in this case. In the alternative, he submits, having regard to the previous convictions for manslaughter, the learned judge should have concluded that the starting point must be increased well above 30 years and should further have concluded that even after making appropriate allowance for the mitigation, the minimum term should have been significantly in excess of 30 years. On behalf of Mr Johnson, Miss Henry QC submits that the learned judge took a perfectly proper approach to the application of schedule 21 to the complex circumstances of this case and that the minimum term of 26 years cannot be said to be unduly lenient or ""much too low"". She submits that the suggestion that the experienced judge, after a careful assessment, passed a sentence which was ""much too low"" is difficult to reconcile with the blunt fact of a 26 year minimum term. She emphasises the history of depressive illness and the indications that Mr Johnson was relapsing into a further episode of depressive illness in the days leading up to the murder of Miss Best. She urges the court not inappropriately to undervalue that mitigation. In reflecting upon those submissions we start by considering the statutory framework applicable to this case. The determination as to what punishment is just and proportionate in the circumstances of a particular offence necessarily involves a determination of the seriousness of that offence. So far as material for present purposes, section 143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides as follows: ""143 Determining the seriousness of an offence (1) In considering the seriousness of any offence, the court must consider the offender's culpability in committing the offence and any harm which the offence caused, was intended to cause or might foreseeably have caused. (2) In considering the seriousness of an offence ('the current offence') committed by an offender who has one or more previous convictions, the court must treat each previous conviction as an aggravating factor if (in the case of that conviction) the court considers that it can reasonably be so treated having regard, in particular, to (a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence, and (b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction."" The sentence for murder is fixed by law. It is one of life imprisonment. The effect of section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is that a court when imposing a mandatory life sentence for murder must specify the minimum term which must elapse before the early release provisions (in other words the provisions relating to release on licence) can apply. The minimum term is the period which the court considers appropriate, taking into account the seriousness of the offence. If the court is of the opinion that because of the seriousness of the offence the early release provisions should not apply to the offender, section 269(4) requires the court so to order. That is commonly referred to as a whole life order. Section 269(5) requires the court in considering the seriousness of the offence to have regard to the general principles set out in schedule 21. Paragraph 4 of schedule 21 provides: ""(1) If (a) the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is exceptionally high, and (b) the offender was aged 21 or over when he committed the offence, The appropriate starting point is a whole life order. (2) Cases that would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include (a) the murder of two or more persons, where each murder involves any of the following (i) a substantial degree of premeditation or planning, (ii) the abduction of the victim, or (iii) sexual or sadistic conduct, (b) the murder of a child if involving the abduction of the child or sexual or sadistic motivation, (c) a murder done for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, or (d) a murder by an offender previously convicted of murder."" Paragraph 5 provides: ""(1) If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when he committed the offence, The appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years. (2) Cases that (if not falling within paragraph 4(1)) would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include (a) the murder of a police officer or prison officer in the course of his duty, (b) a murder involving the use of a firearm or explosive, (c) a murder done for gain (such as a murder done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary, done for payment or done in the expectation of gain as a result of the death), (d) a murder intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice, (e) a murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct, (f) the murder of two or more persons, (g) a murder that is racially or religiously aggravated or aggravated by sexual orientation, or (h) a murder falling within paragraph 4(2) committed by an offender who was aged under 21 when he committed the offence."" Paragraph 8 of schedule 21 provides: ""8 Having chosen a starting point, the court should take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors, to the extent that it has not allowed for them in its choice of starting point."" Consideration of those features may lead the court to adjust the starting point either upwards or downwards. Paragraphs 10 and 11 set out non-exhaustive lists of potential aggravating and mitigating factors. It should be noted that one of the potential mitigating factors is a lack of premeditation. When a court does not make a whole life order, but specifies a minimum term, that means precisely what it says. It is the minimum number of years which must pass before the murderer can even be considered for release on licence. Even when the minimum term expires, release on licence does not follow immediately or as a matter of course. The Parole Board must decide whether the protection of the public requires the continued detention of the murderer and will only release him when it is satisfied that it is safe to do so. Those features of a life sentence for murder provide the public with the necessary protection for the future. Thus the minimum term is intended to be the term which is appropriate by way of punishment and retribution. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for a court to increase that term in order to protect the public. We must next mention some features of relevant case law. So far as a whole life order is concerned, in Jones and others [2006] 2 CrAppR (S) 19 , at paragraph 10, the Lord Chief Justice said of a whole life order: "" Often, perhaps usually, where such an order is called for the case will not be on the borderline. The facts of the case, considered as a whole, will leave the judge in no doubt that the offender must be kept in prison for the rest of his or her life."" In Oakes and others [2013] QB 679, Lord Judge, LCJ, said at paragraph 12, that the decision as to whether a whole life order is necessary is therefore a discretionary aspect of the judge's sentencing decision. At paragraph 29 he said that such an order ""is reserved for the few exceptionally serious offences in which, after reflecting on all the features of aggravation and mitigation, the judge is satisfied that the element of just punishment and retribution requires the imposition of a whole life order. If that conclusion is justified, the whole life order is appropriate: but only then. It is not a mandatory or automatic or minimum sentence."" Those well-established principles have been reiterated in more recent cases. In Reynolds [2015] 1 CrAppR (S) 24 , at paragraph 5, Lord Thomas, LCJ emphasised that the guidance in schedule 21 is provided to assist the judge to determine the appropriate sentence, that each case will depend critically on its particular facts and that the court should take into account consideration the fact of a guilty plea to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term. Turning now to the provisions of paragraph 5 of schedule 21, this court in Khaleel [2013] 1 Cr.App.R (S) 122, rejected a submission that the court was bound to adopt a 15-year starting point in any case which fell outside the specific identified criteria in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the schedule. The court held that the sentencer must make a judgment as to the seriousness of the offence, and may properly find the case to be of exceptionally high or particularly high seriousness even though it cannot be brought within the specific circumstances listed in paragraphs 4 and 5. A previous conviction for manslaughter may lead a judge to treat a subsequent offence of murder as an offence of particularly high seriousness. In the circumstances of that case, the sentencing judge had been entitled to conclude that an offence of murder committed while the offender was on licence from a sentence of eight years' imprisonment imposed for manslaughter, was an offence of particularly high seriousness and that the 30-year starting point should apply. However, in all the circumstances of that case, ""that conclusion would have reflected all the relevant aggravating features."" As to the age/or ill-health of an offender, this court in Clarke [2017] 2 CrAppR (S) 18 made clear that these are factors which should be taken into account in a limited way. The focus of the court should be on the extent to which a custodial sentence will be more onerous than in the case of a younger, fitter offender. At paragraph 25 the Vice President, Hallett LJ said: ""Whilst we consider that an offender's diminished life expectancy, his age, health and the prospect of dying in prison are factors legitimately to be taken into account in passing sentence, they have to be balanced against the gravity of the offending, (including the harm done to victims), and the public interest in setting appropriate punishment for very serious crimes."" We have applied those principles in reaching our decision in these this case. Of the three points specifically relied upon by the Solicitor General, it seems to us that our focus must be on the gravity of Mr Johnson's crime. The need to protect the public from harm is, as we have indicated, catered for by the nature and the effect of the mandatory life sentence. The reference to public concern about cases of this kind is, as we see it, an aspect of the gravity of the offending. The learned judge did not regard this as a case in which a whole life order was necessary. That was not of course a conclusion that this is anything other than a very serious case, but rather a conclusion that it is not one of the rare and exceptional cases in which such an order is necessary. As the authorities to which we have referred make clear, that is a discretionary decision. We must therefore consider whether it can be said that the sentence was unduly lenient because in all the circumstances it was not properly open to the judge reasonably to conclude that a whole life order was unnecessary. In our judgment, it plainly was open to him reasonably to reach that conclusion as he did. Having regard to Mr Johnson's age and disability, to his guilty plea and to all the circumstances of the case, the learned judge was entitled to conclude that a long minimum term constituted just punishment and retribution for this dreadful crime. We are therefore unable to accept the submission of the Solicitor General that the judge was bound to impose a whole life order. As to the determination of the minimum term, it is in our view clear from the passage in the sentencing remarks which we have quoted that the learned judge regarded the aggravating factors which he identified as collectively making this a case of particularly high seriousness, so that the 30 year minimum term was the appropriate starting point. Having taken all of the aggravating features of the case into account in reaching that decision, he did not then find any further aggravating feature which required him to add to that minimum term. It followed that the effect of the mitigating factors and of the guilty plea was to reduce the sentence below the 30-year starting point. It was in that way that he reached his decision that the appropriate minimum term was one of 26 years. The key question, as it seems to us, is whether that approach was unduly lenient. We naturally hesitate to differ from the assessment made by a highly experienced judge and we acknowledge the force of many of the points made to him and to us by Miss Henry. Nonetheless, and with all respect to the learned judge, we conclude that he did fall into error. Paragraph 8 of schedule 21 requires the court to take account of aggravating factors to the extent that it has not allowed for them in deciding the appropriate minimum term. The judge here correctly identified the aggravating factors and rightly observed that it must be well-nigh unprecedented for an offender to plead guilty to murder having twice previously been charged with murder and convicted of manslaughter. In our judgment, however, he fell into error in his assessment of the weight to be given to those factors, individually and collectively, in determining the seriousness of the offence of murder. It must be remembered that the two previous convictions were for voluntary manslaughter in circumstances where all the ingredients of the offence of murder were proved or admitted but one of the partial defences was successfully invoked. Moreover, the first offence of manslaughter was a case of provocation, not a case in which Mr Johnson's mental health was relevant to the verdict. In our view, the passage of many years since those convictions does not significantly reduce the extent to which they aggravate the seriousness of the present crime. In addition, we agree with the learned judge that Mr Johnson's breach of the condition of his discharge from hospital was a gravely aggravating feature. The obvious purpose of that condition was to safeguard any women with whom Mr Johnson formed or tried to form a relationship. We find nothing in the evidence about Mr Johnson's mental health problems to suggest that he was not fully aware of the importance of the condition. We are unable to accept Miss Henry's submission that it was in some way inappropriate to leave a person with a history of mental health problems to self-report, as this condition required him to do. We have referred to the two assessments which preceded his discharge and to the assessment made at that time that he could be trusted to self-report about this matter. Against that background, Mr Johnson deliberately breached the requirement, not only by failing to disclose relationships to those whom he should have told, but by actively concealing the fact of his relationship with Miss Best when they asked him questions in general terms about any relationship. The awful reality, as it seems to us, is that Miss Best may well have been alive today if Mr Johnson had complied with that important requirement of his conditional discharge from hospital. It is not for us to speculate as to whether she would ever have begun a relationship with Mr Johnson in the first place if she had then known of his true history, but if appropriately advised and warned she would surely at the very least have been on her guard for signs indicative of a decline on his part towards depression, with the associated increase in the risk to her safety. In our view, the combination of the first manslaughter conviction and the brutal circumstances of this murder of a woman who had gone to Mr Johnson's home trusting that he would behave properly towards her, should, without more, have caused the judge to regard this as a case of particularly high seriousness. So too should the combination of two previous convictions for manslaughter followed by the murder of a third woman with whom he had been in a relationship. It follows that in our view the judge should have concluded that the appropriate starting point was 30 years, even without taking into account all three of the factors which he identified. He should then have regarded those features which he had not already taken into account as necessitating an increase from the starting point. We agree with Miss Henry that the judge in such a situation must not count the same factor twice; but that does not mean that the judge must simply look to all the factors collectively in reaching the 30-year starting point, without also considering whether that starting point is reached even before they are all taken into account. Thus in our judgment, with respect to the learned judge, he failed to give sufficient weight individually and collectively to all three factors. In our judgment, notwithstanding Mr Johnson's age and disability, those factors necessitated not only a starting point of 30 years but also a significant increase in that starting point. We conclude that after a trial, but before consideration of personal mitigation, the appropriate minimum term would have been one of 35 years. We give rather greater weight to the personal mitigation than did the learned judge. We do so principally because imprisonment will undoubtedly be very much harder for Mr Johnson as an aging man, largely dependent upon the assistance of others, than for a younger prisoner in better health. We accept Miss Henry's submission that the marginal adjustment to the conventional reduction for a guilty plea was one which the judge was entitled to make. In all the circumstances of the case, it seems to us that the combined effect of the personal mitigation, followed by appropriate credit for the late guilty plea, is to reduce the minimum term of 35 years which we have mentioned to one of 30 years. For those reasons, we accept the submission of the Solicitor General that the sentencing of Mr Johnson was unduly lenient. By treating all of the aggravating features of the case as collectively necessitating a starting point of 30 years, but not as necessitating an increase above that starting point, the learned judge failed fully to reflect the true seriousness of this crime. We therefore quash the minimum term of 26 years imposed below and we substitute for it a minimum term of 30 years. As before, 358 days spent on remand in custody will count towards that minimum term.

LEECH appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE : This is the judgment of the Court. On 25th January 1985 at Stafford Crown Court this appellant, Hansford Delroy Nedrick, was convicted by a majority verdict of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The jury were discharged from returning verdicts on two further counts, one of arson with intent to endanger life and the other of arson being reckless as to life being endangered. On 20th May last, having declined to apply the proviso, we substituted for the verdict of murder a verdict of guilty of manslaughter and passed therefore a sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment under the provisions of section 3 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. We now give our reasons. The case for the Crown was that the appellant had a grudge against a woman called Viola Foreshaw, as a result of which, after threats that he would ""burn her out"", he went to her house in the early hours of 15th July 1984, poured paraffin through the letter-box and onto the front door and set it alight. He gave no warning. The house was burnt down and one of Viola Foreshaw's children, a boy aged 12 called Lloyd, died of asphyxiation and burns. After a number of interviews during which he denied any responsibility, the appellant eventually confessed to the police that he had started the fire in the manner described, adding, ""I didn't want anyone to die, I am not a murderer; please tell the Judge; God knows I am not a murderer."" When asked why he did it, he replied, ""Just to wake her up and frighten her."" The appellant's defence, rejected by the jury, was that he had neither started the fire nor made any admissions to that effect. The sole effective ground of appeal is that the Judge misdirected the jury on the intent necessary to establish a charge of murder. This is the direction which he gave: ""It is not necessary to prove an intention to kill; the Crown's case is made out if they prove an intention to cause serious injury - that is sufficient ..... There is, however, an alternative state of mind which you will have to consider. If when the accused performed the act of setting fire to the house, he knew that it was highly probable that the act would result in serious bodily injury to somebody inside the house, even though he did not desire it - desire to bring that result about - he is guilty or murder. If you are sure that he did the unlawful and deliberate act, and, if you are sure that that was his state of mind, then, again, the prosecution's case in the alternative of murder would be established.' That direction was given before the publication of the speeches in the House of Lords in Moloney (1985) AC 905 and Hancock (1986) 2 V.L.R. 357. In the light of those speeches it was plainly wrong. The direction was based on a passage in the 41 st Edition of Archbold, which has been repeated in the 42nd Edition, paragraph 17-13. That passage was expressly disapproved in Moloney at page 917 et seq, in that it equates foresight with intention, whereas ""foresight of consequences, as an element bearing on the issue of intention in murder ...... belongs, not to the substantive law, but to the law of evidence"", per Lord Bridge at page 928F. The Judge was in no way to blame of course for having directed the jury in this way. What then does a jury have to decide far as the mental element in murder is concerned? It simply has to decide whether the defendant intended to kill or do serious bodily harm. In order to reach that decision the jury must pay regard to all the relevant circumstances, including what the defendant himself said and did. In the great majority of cases a direction to that effect will be enough, particularly where the defendant's actions amounted to a direct attack upon his victim, because in such cases the evidence relating to the defendant's desire or motive will be clear and his intent will have been the same as his desire or motive. But in some cases, of which this is one, the defendant does an act which is manifestly dangerous and as a result someone dies. The primary desire or motive of the defendant may not have been to harm that person, or indeed anyone. In that situation what further directions should a jury be given as to the mental state which they oust find to exist in the defendant if murder is to be proved? We have endeavoured to crystallise the effect of their Lordships' speeches in Moloney and Hancock in a way which we hope Bay be helpful to Judges who have to handle this type of case. It may be advisable first of all to explain to the jury that a man nay intend to achieve a certain result whilst at the same time not desiring it to come about. In Moloney at page 926E Lord Bridge gave an illustration of the distinction: ""A man who, at London Airport, boards a place which he knows to be bound for Manchester, clearly intends to travel to Manchester, even though Manchester is the last place he wants to be and his motive for boarding the plane is simply to escape pursuit."" The man who knowingly boards the Manchester aircraft wants to go there in the sense that boarding it is a voluntary act. His desire to leave London predominates over his desire not to go to Manchester. When he decides to board the aircraft, if not before, he forms the intention to travel to Manchester. In Hancock the House decided that the Moloney guidelines require a reference to probability. Lord Scarman said at page 364G: ""They also require an explanation that the greater the probability of a consequence the more likely it is that the consequence was foreseen and that if that consequence was foreseen the greater the probability is that that consequence was also intended."" When determining whether the defendant had the necessary intent, it may therefore be helpful for a jury to ask themselves two questions: (1) How probable was the consequence which resulted from the defendant's voluntary act? (2) Did he foresee that consequence? If he did not appreciate that death or really serious harm was likely to result from his act, he cannot have intended to bring it about. If he did, hut thought that the risk to which he was exposing the person killed was only slight, then it may be easy for the jury to conclude that he did not intend to bring about that result. On the other hand, if the jury are satisfied that at the material time the defendant recognised that death or serious harm would be virtually certain (barring some unforeseen intervention) to result from his voluntary act, then that is a fact from which they may find it easy to infer that he intended to kill or do serious bodily harm, even though he may not have had any desire to achieve that result. As Lord Bridge said in Moloney (page 925H): "".... the probability of the consequence taken to have been foreseen must be little short of overwhelming before it will suffice to establish the necessary intent"". At page 926F he uses the expression ""moral certainty""; at page 929B he said, ""... will lead to a certain consequence unless something unexpected supervenes to prevent it"". Where the charge is murder and in the rare cases where the simple direction is not enough, the jury should be directed that they are not entitled to infer the necessary intention, unless they feel sure that death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) as a result of the defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case. Where a man realises that it is for all practical purposes inevitable that his actions will result in death or serious harm, the inference may be irresistible that he intended that result, however little he may have desired or wished it to happen. The decision is one for the jury to be reached upon a consideration of all the evidence.

MS K LUMSDON KC appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT (APPROVED) ____________________ Crown Copyright © THE VICE-PRESIDENT: On 17 June 2022, after a trial in the Crown Court at Bristol before Garnham J and a jury, this appellant was convicted of the murders of Jennifer Chapple and Stephen Chapple. He was subsequently sentenced for each of those offences to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 38 years less the days he had spent remanded in custody. He now appeals against his sentence by leave of the full court. The victims of the murders were husband and wife. They and their two young children lived next door to the appellant. For some months they and the appellant had been in dispute about parking outside their properties, which appears to have become a cause of stress for all concerned. There had been an incident on 11 November 2021, when the appellant had been abusive to Mrs Chapple in a manner which caused her significant concern. The appellant, now aged 35 and of previous good character, is himself the father of two young children. He is a former soldier, whose 10 years of service included a tour of duty in Afghanistan. When he left the Army he was presented with a dagger, which he kept in a display case. It appears that he and his wife were experiencing difficulties in their marriage. On the evening of 21 November 2021 his wife told him that she wanted a trial separation. A short time after she had done so the appellant armed himself with the dagger. He climbed over the fence into the Chapples' back garden, crept to their back door and entered their house. They were together in the living room. Their children were asleep upstairs. The appellant immediately attacked Mr and Mrs Chapple, striking with such speed and force that neither had any chance of resisting or escaping. Mrs Chapple was not even able to rise from the sofa. He stabbed each of them repeatedly, inflicting severe injuries from which both his victims quickly died. His own wife, next door, heard screaming. Audio recordings available at trial and to this court captured the appellant shouting: ""Die you bastards, die"" as he stabbed Mr and Mrs Chapple. The appellant left his victims where they lay and climbed back over the fence to his own home. A short time later he telephoned the police and reported that he had stabbed his neighbours. When interviewed under caution the appellant made no reply. He entered guilty pleas to offences of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. Those pleas were not accepted by the prosecution and the trial proceeded. Expert medical evidence was adduced about the appellant's mental condition. The jury convicted the appellant of both offences of murder. The judge did not think it necessary to obtain a pre-sentence report and none is necessary now. The victim personal statements provided by members of the Chapples' family were available to the judge. They made clear the ""insurmountable grief"" which has been caused to the bereaved by these murders. Members of the family not only had to identify the bodies of the deceased but also, some days later, to explain what had happened to the Chapples' children. Each member of this court has read those statements. We offer the bereaved our condolences. The judge accepted the evidence that the appellant was suffering from depression but was satisfied that the appellant bore full responsibility for his actions. Having considered the provisions of schedule 21 to the Sentencing Code, he took a starting point for the minimum term of 30 years. He found three aggravating factors: the fact that the appellant had brought the dagger from his own home to the scene; the commission of the offence at night and in the victims' own home where they were entitled to feel safe; and the fact that the Chapples' children were asleep upstairs at the time of the murders. He also noted that although the murders were not long planned or premeditated, they were not entirely spontaneous either. As to the first of those features, the judge observed that Parliament has decided that the fact that a weapon was brought to the scene will usually justify an increase of 10 years in the starting point for a single murder. He continued: ""There is no equivalent provision where a knife is brought to the scene to carry out two murders but, plainly, that fact constitutes a grave aggravating factor which I must bear in mind when fixing on the minimum term here."" The judge then listed six mitigating factors. First, the appellant's remorse, which he accepted as genuine. Secondly, some allowance was to be made for the fact that the appellant was suffering from moderate depression at the time, though that did not satisfy the test for diminished responsibility and did not explain the appellant's decision to attack his neighbours. Thirdly, the appellant's action in calling the police immediately after the killings and waiting at the scene for them to arrive. Fourthly, his admission of the killings in his initial phonecall to the police. Fifthly, his military service. Lastly, the fact that the appellant would, on any view, be an old man before he will be eligible to apply for release on licence. The judge concluded that the aggravating factors far outweighed the mitigating features and that the appropriate minimum term was 38 years before deducting the period spent remanded in custody. In her written and oral submissions Ms Martin KC, who represents the appellant in this court as she did at trial, argues that the judge took a wrong approach in sentencing, and that the minimum term was manifestly excessive in length. She submits that the judge appears to have treated the 25-year starting point, in a case where a weapon is taken to the scene and used to commit a single murder, as indicating a ""standard uplift"" of 10 years in the starting point for two murders. Having done so, she submits, the judge then fell into the error of double counting by treating the location of the offence to which the dagger had been taken as a further aggravating factor. She also submits that the judge gave insufficient weight to the mitigating factors. She suggests that, before considering those mitigating factors, the judge must have reached a provisional minimum term in excess of 40 years. In support of her submissions Ms Martin points to case law supporting the well-established need for judges to avoid applying Schedule 21 inflexibly or mechanistically. For the respondent, Ms Lumsdon KC submits that the judge did not fall into the suggested errors and that a provisional starting point of 40 years before consideration of mitigating factors was justified in the circumstances of this case. She further submits that the judge gave due weight to the mitigating factors, and that the minimum term of 38 years, before deducting the period spent remanded in custody, was neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive. We are grateful to both counsel for their very clear submissions. The imposition of life sentences for these murders was, of course, required by law. In determining the appropriate minimum term to be served, before the appellant could even be considered for release on licence, the judge was required by section 322 of the Sentencing Code to consider the seriousness of the offending. In doing so, he was required by subsection (3)(a) to ""have regard to the general principles set out in Schedule 21"". As is well-known, that schedule sets out different starting points for the minimum term in different categories of murder. Paragraph 2 of the Schedule indicates that a whole life order is the appropriate starting point where the seriousness of the case is exceptionally high. The judge rightly decided that these murders did not fall into that category. Paragraph 3 indicates a starting point of 30 years where the seriousness of the case is particularly high; and by subparagraph (2)(f), the murder of two or more persons would normally fall within that paragraph. By paragraph 4, if a case does not fall within paragraphs 2 or 3, a starting point of 25 years will normally be appropriate where an offender took a knife or other weapon to the scene intending to commit any offence or to have it available to use as a weapon, and used it in committing the murder. In other cases the starting point will normally be 15 years. The judge found, correctly, that this case fell within paragraph 3. It follows that paragraph 4 did not apply. However, the judge did not purport to apply it. He would have been in error if he had treated paragraph 4 as establishing or requiring a ""standard uplift"" in every case of murder using a knife or other weapon taken to the scene with the requisite intent, even if falling outside paragraph 4. We do not, however, accept the suggestion that that is what the judge did. In our view, the judge, in the words that we have quoted, made plain that he was not falling into that error, but rather was treating the use of a knife taken to the scene as an aggravating factor. The use of a weapon will usually be an aggravating feature of any murder, whether it is taken to the scene or not. In a case which falls within paragraphs 2 or 3 of the Schedule, the fact that the weapon was taken to the scene will generally be a further aggravating factor. However, the weight to be given to those aggravating factors will vary according to the circumstances of a specific case, and will be a matter for the judgement of the sentencer, with whose evaluation this Court will be slow to interfere. The real issue in this case, as we see it, is whether the judge erred in his overall balancing of the aggravating and mitigating factors. He was faced with a difficult task in determining the appropriate minimum term for these dreadful murders, and we recognise that he had the advantage, which we do not, of having presided over the trial and heard all the evidence. He correctly identified the aggravating factors. The appellant plainly armed himself with the dagger, a highly dangerous weapon, because he had decided to kill his victims. In order to carry out that intention, he went armed into their home, the place in which the judge rightly said they were entitled to feel safe. He had the advantage of taking the Chapples by surprise, and they were effectively defenceless against his ruthless attack. He must have known that the children would be asleep upstairs and that his actions would render them orphans at a young age. We agree with Ms Martin that there is some degree of overlap between some of those factors; but even being careful to avoid any risk of double counting, those features of the case plainly necessitated a substantial upwards adjustment of the starting point. We cannot however accept Ms Lumsdon's submission that they justified an uplift of the starting point to 40 years or more. In addition, we see force in Ms Martin's submission that more weight should have been given to the mitigating factors. Even in a case as serious as this, and even though outweighed by the aggravating factors, the mitigating factors correctly identified by the judge collectively carried significant weight. We have hesitated to differ from the overall evaluation of these factors made by the judge. We are, however, persuaded that the balance which he struck went outside the range properly open to him, with the result that the minimum term was manifestly excessive. For those reasons we allow this appeal. We quash the minimum term of 38 years less the days remanded in custody. We substitute for it a minimum term of 35 years, less the 209 days which we are told is the correct figure for the time spent remanded in custody. That reduced minimum term takes effect from the day when the judge pronounced sentence.

When interviewed under caution the appellant made no reply. He entered guilty pleas to offences of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. Those pleas were not accepted by the prosecution and the trial proceeded. Expert medical evidence was adduced about the appellant's mental condition. The jury convicted the appellant of both offences of murder. The judge did not think it necessary to obtain a pre-sentence report and none is necessary now. The victim personal statements provided by members of the Chapples' family were available to the judge. They made clear the ""insurmountable grief"" which has been caused to the bereaved by these murders. Members of the family not only had to identify the bodies of the deceased but also, some days later, to explain what had happened to the Chapples' children. Each member of this court has read those statements. We offer the bereaved our condolences. The judge accepted the evidence that the appellant was suffering from depression but was satisfied that the appellant bore full responsibility for his actions. Having considered the provisions of schedule 21 to the Sentencing Code, he took a starting point for the minimum term of 30 years. He found three aggravating factors: the fact that the appellant had brought the dagger from his own home to the scene; the commission of the offence at night and in the victims' own home where they were entitled to feel safe; and the fact that the Chapples' children were asleep upstairs at the time of the murders. He also noted that although the murders were not long planned or premeditated, they were not entirely spontaneous either. As to the first of those features, the judge observed that Parliament has decided that the fact that a weapon was brought to the scene will usually justify an increase of 10 years in the starting point for a single murder. He continued: ""There is no equivalent provision where a knife is brought to the scene to carry out two murders but, plainly, that fact constitutes a grave aggravating factor which I must bear in mind when fixing on the minimum term here."" The judge then listed six mitigating factors. First, the appellant's remorse, which he accepted as genuine. Secondly, some allowance was to be made for the fact that the appellant was suffering from moderate depression at the time, though that did not satisfy the test for diminished responsibility and did not explain the appellant's decision to attack his neighbours. Thirdly, the appellant's action in calling the police immediately after the killings and waiting at the scene for them to arrive. Fourthly, his admission of the killings in his initial phonecall to the police. Fifthly, his military service. Lastly, the fact that the appellant would, on any view, be an old man before he will be eligible to apply for release on licence. The judge concluded that the aggravating factors far outweighed the mitigating features and that the appropriate minimum term was 38 years before deducting the period spent remanded in custody. In her written and oral submissions Ms Martin KC, who represents the appellant in this court as she did at trial, argues that the judge took a wrong approach in sentencing, and that the minimum term was manifestly excessive in length. She submits that the judge appears to have treated the 25-year starting point, in a case where a weapon is taken to the scene and used to commit a single murder, as indicating a ""standard uplift"" of 10 years in the starting point for two murders. Having done so, she submits, the judge then fell into the error of double counting by treating the location of the offence to which the dagger had been taken as a further aggravating factor. She also submits that the judge gave insufficient weight to the mitigating factors. She suggests that, before considering those mitigating factors, the judge must have reached a provisional minimum term in excess of 40 years. In support of her submissions Ms Martin points to case law supporting the well-established need for judges to avoid applying Schedule 21 inflexibly or mechanistically. For the respondent, Ms Lumsdon KC submits that the judge did not fall into the suggested errors and that a provisional starting point of 40 years before consideration of mitigating factors was justified in the circumstances of this case. She further submits that the judge gave due weight to the mitigating factors, and that the minimum term of 38 years, before deducting the period spent remanded in custody, was neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive. We are grateful to both counsel for their very clear submissions. The imposition of life sentences for these murders was, of course, required by law. In determining the appropriate minimum term to be served, before the appellant could even be considered for release on licence, the judge was required by section 322 of the Sentencing Code to consider the seriousness of the offending. In doing so, he was required by subsection (3)(a) to ""have regard to the general principles set out in Schedule 21"". As is well-known, that schedule sets out different starting points for the minimum term in different categories of murder. Paragraph 2 of the Schedule indicates that a whole life order is the appropriate starting point where the seriousness of the case is exceptionally high. The judge rightly decided that these murders did not fall into that category. Paragraph 3 indicates a starting point of 30 years where the seriousness of the case is particularly high; and by subparagraph (2)(f), the murder of two or more persons would normally fall within that paragraph. By paragraph 4, if a case does not fall within paragraphs 2 or 3, a starting point of 25 years will normally be appropriate where an offender took a knife or other weapon to the scene intending to commit any offence or to have it available to use as a weapon, and used it in committing the murder. In other cases the starting point will normally be 15 years. The judge found, correctly, that this case fell within paragraph 3. It follows that paragraph 4 did not apply. However, the judge did not purport to apply it. He would have been in error if he had treated paragraph 4 as establishing or requiring a ""standard uplift"" in every case of murder using a knife or other weapon taken to the scene with the requisite intent, even if falling outside paragraph 4. We do not, however, accept the suggestion that that is what the judge did. In our view, the judge, in the words that we have quoted, made plain that he was not falling into that error, but rather was treating the use of a knife taken to the scene as an aggravating factor. The use of a weapon will usually be an aggravating feature of any murder, whether it is taken to the scene or not. In a case which falls within paragraphs 2 or 3 of the Schedule, the fact that the weapon was taken to the scene will generally be a further aggravating factor. However, the weight to be given to those aggravating factors will vary according to the circumstances of a specific case, and will be a matter for the judgement of the sentencer, with whose evaluation this Court will be slow to interfere. The real issue in this case, as we see it, is whether the judge erred in his overall balancing of the aggravating and mitigating factors. He was faced with a difficult task in determining the appropriate minimum term for these dreadful murders, and we recognise that he had the advantage, which we do not, of having presided over the trial and heard all the evidence. He correctly identified the aggravating factors. The appellant plainly armed himself with the dagger, a highly dangerous weapon, because he had decided to kill his victims. In order to carry out that intention, he went armed into their home, the place in which the judge rightly said they were entitled to feel safe. He had the advantage of taking the Chapples by surprise, and they were effectively defenceless against his ruthless attack. He must have known that the children would be asleep upstairs and that his actions would render them orphans at a young age. We agree with Ms Martin that there is some degree of overlap between some of those factors; but even being careful to avoid any risk of double counting, those features of the case plainly necessitated a substantial upwards adjustment of the starting point. We cannot however accept Ms Lumsdon's submission that they justified an uplift of the starting point to 40 years or more. In addition, we see force in Ms Martin's submission that more weight should have been given to the mitigating factors. Even in a case as serious as this, and even though outweighed by the aggravating factors, the mitigating factors correctly identified by the judge collectively carried significant weight. We have hesitated to differ from the overall evaluation of these factors made by the judge. We are, however, persuaded that the balance which he struck went outside the range properly open to him, with the result that the minimum term was manifestly excessive. For those reasons we allow this appeal. We quash the minimum term of 38 years less the days remanded in custody. We substitute for it a minimum term of 35 years, less the 209 days which we are told is the correct figure for the time spent remanded in custody. That reduced minimum term takes effect from the day when the judge pronounced sentence."

LANGDALE KC appeared on behalf of the Appellant. MS J. LEDWARD KC appeared on behalf of the Respondent. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © LORD JUSTICE POPPLEWELL: An order pursuant to s. 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 was made that no matter relating to the offender's grandson R shall be included in any publication of these proceedings or any judgment if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify him as a person concerned in the proceedings. This prohibition will last until he reaches his 18 th birthday. In order to protect his anonymity it has been necessary to anonymise the name of the offender, the victims, and other members of their family. This anonymity will also last only until R reaches his 18 th birthday. On the evening of 29 March 2023 the offender shot and killed JD, the former partner of his daughter, at point-blank range. He drove to the home of JD's father, GD, and shot and killed GD at point-blank range. He was soon apprehended, and made written admissions to the killings shortly thereafter. He pleaded guilty to two counts of murder on 28 June 2023 at an adjourned pre-trial preparation hearing once a psychiatric report had confirmed he was fit to plead. On 23 October 2023 he was sentenced by HHJ Bishop sitting in the Crown Court at Cambridge to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years less 206 days spent on remand on each count, to run concurrently. His Majesty's Solicitor General applies for leave to refer the sentences under s.36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 as unduly lenient. We emphasise at the outset that the minimum length of time which a murderer must serve in prison does not reflect the value of the lives taken away, and does not attempt to do so. The sentence, however long, and whatever the outcome of this application, can never compensate for the grievous loss which has been suffered by the families of the victims in this case. The Facts JD was 32 at the time of his death. He lived alone in a semi-detached house in Bluntisham, Cambridgeshire. His father, GD, was aged 57 at the time of his death. He too lived alone, in a house in Sutton, Cambridgeshire, some six miles away from JD's house. The offender, then aged 66, is a widower. Following the death of his wife in 2020, he sold his home and bought a motor home. At the time of the offending, he was living in that motor home on a campsite in Willingham, Cambridgeshire. He also owned a car. He was the holder of a shotgun licence and lawfully owned a Beretta shotgun. The catalyst for the shootings was a Family Court decision two days earlier, on 27 March 2023. Those proceedings were between the offender's daughter, S, and JD who was her former partner. They had been in a relationship and had a son, R, who was aged seven at the time of the shootings. S and JD had separated shortly after R was born. R lived with his mother but had regular contact with his father. In 2020 S married her current partner, Paul, and they had a daughter together. Paul is a US national who was serving with the US Airforce and was stationed in the UK but had been due to be redeployed back to the United States, and S and Paul planned to move there together with R and their daughter. The Family Court proceedings, which had been going on for some time, had involved disputes about contact and financial arrangements, and now involved an application by S to remove R from the jurisdiction so that he could go with her and Paul and their daughter to the United States. JD, R's father, opposed the application and submitted his own application to increase contact time to 50/50. The interim decision of the Family Court on 27 March 2023 was that JD's contact should not be increased to 50/50, but that R could not be removed from the jurisdiction pending further enquiries and further hearings. There were a number of communications prior to the shootings which were relied upon by the prosecution as evidence of planning. In particular, there were a number of text messages downloaded from the offender's mobile phone which, as the Judge concluded, showed that he was ""getting very involved in the family proceedings dispute between [his] daughter and [JD]"". He also sent text messages over the preceding months, about which the judge said this: ""From the texts which have been produced the family proceedings have been troubling you to a significant degree over the year before the murders. Some of the texts indicate that you are thinking about taking the law into your own hands. The defence submit that these comments were bravado only but they were plainly more than that."" On 17 August 2022 there had been an exchange with someone called April in which the offender had said, ""I have a shortlist of people I intend to murder"". On 19 October 2022 he had said to April, ""I will override any court decision"", adding later ""first hearing end of November. But there is always a plan B."" The offender's telephone contained photographs of the houses occupied by both JD and GD and their vehicles, taken between November 2022 and early February 2023. These had been taken in connection with the family proceedings and were accompanied by commentary about contact arrangements, and financial aspects of the family proceedings, demonstrating the extent to which the offender was getting involved in those family proceedings. The Judge found that although those were not part of the planning for the murders, a by-product of that research was that the offender knew where the victims lived. On 27 March 2023, the day the Family Court made its interim ruling that R could not be removed from the jurisdiction pending further enquiries and hearing, the offender sent a message on his mobile telephone telling a friend ""I will be [R's] carer/guardian, and let [S] and co move over to America. No problems. I'd kill a host of individuals but implication spread out too wide."" There was evidence that at around this time (and on the day of the murders) the offender was making enquiries about viewing properties to rent. On the morning of the murders the offender drove his car to Meridian Close where JD lived, and remained there for about two minutes. He then drove to The Row in Sutton where GD lived, arriving ten minutes later and pausing there for a few seconds. The offender's car was seen again later and briefly in Meridian Close at 3.20 in the afternoon and again at about 4.40. At half past seven in the evening, the offender began a series of checks designed to ensure that the two victims were home and alone for the evening. He drove onto The Row in Sutton. On that occasion, GD returned to his home in his van a few minutes later and the offender drove past GD's home address before leaving the street. At about quarter to eight, he drove into Meridian Close and waited there for about a minute. He repeated that at about five past eight. At about 8.40 he drove along The Row and parked up at the side of the road. He went up to the van parked outside GD's home address before leaving. Shortly before nine o'clock, he drove into Meridian Close again and parked up. At around nine o'clock, JD's girlfriend left his home, having spent the evening there with JD. She drove home, leaving JD alone in his house. Very shortly after her departure, the offender went up to the front door of J's house, carrying his loaded shotgun. He knocked on the front door. When JD opened the front door, the offender shot him at point-blank range, to the left chest and then to the right side of his head. The injuries were rapidly fatal. Alerted by the shots, neighbours emerged from their homes and saw the offender walking from the front door, having closed it behind him, carrying the shotgun which he placed on the backseat of his car before driving off. The neighbours called 999 and soon found JD's body, where he had collapsed in the hallway of his home. The offender drove straight to The Row in Sutton, where his car was seen shortly before 9.15. He parked up. A lady walking a dog noticed him doing something in the boot with a dark long-shaped object, which was undoubtedly the shotgun. He appeared startled by her presence. Within a couple of minutes, at 9.17, the offender knocked on GD's front door. When GD opened the door, the offender shot him three times at point-blank range, to the top of the head, the right chest and the left hip. In fact, four shots had been fired, one of them missing, indicating that the offender had reloaded the two-barrel gun at the scene. Those injuries would have been rapidly fatal. The offender then closed the front door, and left the scene in his car. He drove to the caravan site in Willingham where he had been living, placed the shotgun in a cupboard in his motor home, and drove away in that vehicle, intending, it seems, to drive to Bristol. He was very quickly identified by the police as the murder suspect and that night his motor home was brought to a stop by the police on the M5 at about 1.30 am. He was arrested on suspicion of murder and told the arresting officer where the shotgun was. He was taken to Worcester police station. During the booking-in procedure, he was heard to say ""Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, even if it is wrong in the eyes of the law."" He later said he was very remorseful. He was transferred to Parkside police station in Cambridge, and interviewed under caution in the presence of a solicitor. He answered ""no comment"" to all questions asked. He was charged with murder. He was not arraigned at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing scheduled for 11 May 2023 as a psychiatric report was being prepared as to fitness to plead. He sent the first of three letters to the court on 18 May, a week later, in which he confessed to the two murders and said he had intended to plead guilty at the hearing on 11 May. He said: ""I am struggling with the burden of my guilt and wish to bring to a closure the suffering and emotional stress that my actions on this tragic and fatal night have caused ... if I could turn back time I would and I regret that there are not enough words or remorse I can offer to the families affected by this crime."" He sent a second letter to the court dated 30 May 2023, in which he offered a lengthy explanation of his personal circumstances, and which made plain the connection between his actions and his feelings resulting from the outcome of the Family Court hearing. He set out his personal history from the time when his wife was diagnosed with cancer, and the difficulties faced by him over the following years in having to care for her alone until her death. He indicated that he had used alcohol in order to manage his stress and his anguish. In that letter he made a number of derogatory assertions about JD's care of his child R, which were not accepted by the prosecution. At the adjourned Pre-trial Preparation Hearing on 28 June, the offender pleaded guilty to the two counts of murder on the indictment. Shortly before the sentencing hearing, on 20 October 2023, a third letter written by the offender was uploaded to the Digital Case System. The content of that letter is important. Much of it repeats that which the offender had previously set out in his earlier letters. He said that his actions were ""driven"" by the actions of JD, encouraged by his father GD, and the offender's overwhelming desire to protect his grandson: ""My action has been driven by the physical and emotional abuse from his biological male parent and the failure of the family courts ... I would not and cannot condone what happened but love can be blind and be the catalyst for tragedy. This is a crime of passion."" ""During these years of caring for my wife and acting as [R's] father and grandfather, I would acknowledge I developed anger management issues towards [JD & GD] over their mistreatment of [R]."" He said that when he received a letter from JD's solicitors advising that JD would be making an application to the Family Court for greater contact ""from this moment on I struggled to manage my anger, stress, anxiety, and the red mist brought on by my growing alcohol dependency. But despite my rage moments, I never planned any harm and am ashamed of the events of 29 March."" He said that the decision of the Family Court on 27 March: ""May have been the point where the straw broke the camel's back, but I tried hard to control my anger."" The decision was, in his words, ""a catastrophic error of judgment which would ruin [R]'s life"" and which had ""pushed me over the edge"": ""The court had failed [R] and thus failed me. The decision proved to be catalyst for all of the dark thoughts I was struggling to manage and control. I had failed [R]. In my mind [JD] had destroyed [R] in an instance (sic) and this was born from his own interests. My grandchildren have now been placed in care for the crimes of their grandfather. I despise myself for all the hurt I have caused and am continuing to cause."" ""I was in a fragile state of the mind at the time [of the murders] but I would never seek to use my mental health to defend this act."" He continued to express his remorse for his actions, somewhat qualified by his explanations. The letter concluded: ""Unfortunately, I am driven by a duty, and human instinct to protect and care for the ones I love. I accept this should not have been at the expense of the law, but I do not believe the family courts are fit for purpose"". The final two paragraphs made further criticisms of the working of the Family Courts generally. Sentencing The offender had no previous convictions or cautions recorded against him. When sentencing there were no reports before the court. Although a psychiatric report had been obtained during the course of the proceedings, it was not served on the court and no reliance was placed upon it by the defence at any stage, including at the sentencing hearing. Having raised the matter explicitly with defence counsel, the judge was satisfied that he did not need to obtain a psychiatric report before sentencing the offender. The judge had victim personal statements which detailed the devastating effects which the murder had had on the family of the two victims. In advance of the sentencing hearing, prosecution counsel had prepared a sentencing note setting out the facts, the relevant statutory provisions and the applicable guidelines. The defence also put forward a sentencing note. The relevant law and guidelines The mandatory sentence for an offence of murder committed by an adult is imprisonment for life (s.321 of the Sentencing Act 2020). In fixing the minimum term, the Sentencing Act requires the court to have regard to sch.21 of that Act in doing so, and to any other relevant guidelines which are not incompatible with that schedule. In respect of adult offenders, sch.21 sets four starting points in fixing the minimum term. They are starting points which are expressed to be those which will ""normally"" apply depending on the presence of specific features. They are a whole life order, a minimum term of 30 years, a minimum term of 25 years, and a minimum term of 15 years. So far as relevant, sch.21 states as follows: ""Starting points 2(1) If (a) the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is exceptionally high, and (b) the offender was aged 21 or over when the offence was committed, the appropriate starting point is a whole life order. (2) Cases that would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include (a) the murder of two or more persons, where each murder involves any of the following (i) a substantial degree of premeditation or planning. [...] 3(1) If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 2(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when the offence was committed, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years. (2) Cases that (if not falling within paragraph 2(1)) would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include [...] (b) a murder involving the use of a firearm or explosive, [...] (d) a murder intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice. [...] (f) the murder of two or more persons. [...] Aggravating and mitigating factors 7. Having chosen a starting point, the court should take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors, to the extent that it has not allowed for them in its choice of starting point. 8. Detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the making of a whole life order. 9. Aggravating factors (additional to those mentioned in paragraphs 2(2), 3(2) ... ) that may be relevant to the offence of murder include (a) a significant degree of planning or premeditation. [...] 10. Mitigating factors that may be relevant to the offence of murder include [...] (d) the fact that the offender was provoked (for example, by prolonged stress) but, in the case of a murder committed before 4 October 2010, in a way not amounting to a defence of provocation."" There was no dispute that a life sentence was mandatory and the only question was setting the minimum term. The prosecution contended that there was an element of premeditation and planning, which the court could consider to be a ""substantial degree"" of premeditation or planning for both murders, and that the court could find that the seriousness of the offences was ""exceptionally high"" within the meaning of para.2 so as to warrant a whole life order. The court's attention was drawn to the guideline case of R v Stewart and others [2022] EWCA Crim 1063 ; [2023] 1 Crim App R (S) 17 on the imposition of whole life terms. The prosecution submitted in the alternative that if the seriousness was not ""exceptionally high"", the case fell clearly within para.3 as one of ""particularly high"" seriousness as it involved the murder of two persons and the use of a firearm, such that the starting point would be one of 30 years. It was suggested that the aggravating features present comprised the presence of two qualifying factors under para.3, that is to say the use of a firearm and the murder of more than one person; the element of planning and premeditation; the fact that the victims were in their own home; and the effect on the surrounding community, which was said to make this equivalent to ""a killing in public"". The court was referred to the Sentencing Council's guideline on ""reduction in sentence for a guilty plea"", which provides that the minimum term should be reduced in the case of a guilty plea to murder, but that such a reduction should not exceed one-sixth of the minimum term, and can never be more than a reduction of five years. On behalf of the offender, the defence submitted to the Judge that the case was not one of exceptionally high seriousness and that the degree of planning for each murder fell short of that which was required to place the case within para.2 of sch.21. It was accepted that the case fell within the category of ""particularly high seriousness"" described in para.3 by reason of the two factors identified, and as such a 30-year starting point was appropriate. It was submitted that the text messages relied upon by the prosecution did not establish, to the criminal standard, that the offender had formed any murderous intent months or weeks before the murders. Any planning or premeditation it was submitted was not ""significant"" and thus there was no statutory aggravating factor of the kind listed in para.9 of sch.21. It was suggested that the offender had only formed a murderous intent when JD's girlfriend left his home on the evening in question, and that the previous visits earlier in the afternoon and evening did not establish premeditation, albeit that it was accepted that the offender had at least made preparation for such an outcome by taking the shotgun in the evening. It was submitted that the mitigating factors outlined in para.10(d) of sch.21 (i.e. ""the fact that the offender was provoked (for example by prolonged stress) but ... in a way not amounting to a defence of provocation"") was present in this case, and required a significant downward reduction to be applied to the minimum term. It was submitted that this was a subjective test, based on what the defendant perceived and what ultimately caused the ""prolonged stress"" which led to him mentally collapsing in a way which led to the commission of the offence. It was also submitted that, inevitably, the offender would die in prison because of his age, and as such his sentence should be further reduced to reflect his age; and further for his lack of previous convictions and for his positive good character. Reliance was also placed on his obvious remorse and on his plea of guilty. Having heard submissions from the crown and the defence on Friday, 20 October 2023, the Judge adjourned to give the matter further consideration over the weekend and pass sentence on the following Monday, 23 October. He described the murders as ""executions"" motivated by the offender's distorted beliefs over the Family Court proceedings in respect of the care of his grandson. Dissatisfied with the decision made at the interim hearing to preserve the status quo, the offender had taken the law into his own hands and ended the lives of two innocent men. Having reviewed the decision of this court in Stewart , the judge concluded that the murders did not fall within para.2 of sch.21 as requiring a whole life order. Instead, para.3 applied, and the seriousness was ""particularly high"" so as to attract a 30-year starting point, on the grounds that there were two murders and a firearm was used. He found that there were additional aggravating factors comprising the following. First, what he characterised as a significant degree of premeditation and planning in the light of (a) the texts earlier in 2022 about taking the law into his own hands, (b) his beliefs about the Family Court ruling, (c) the repeated visits on the day to the victim's home and (d) the offender having a shotgun with him by the evening at latest. Secondly, there was the aggravating factor of both victims being in their homes where they were entitled to be safe. Thirdly, there was an impact on the community, which was an aggravating factor (although the judge did not go so far as to equate this with a ""killing in public""). When it came to aggravating and mitigating factors, the judge said that although two factors referred to in para.3 were present, he declined to treat this as an aggravating feature, saying ""I have already taken [them] into account in arriving at the correct minimum term, so I do not double-count those aspects."" The judge then found that the following mitigation fell to be taken into account. First, the offender's age and previous good character, not just an absence of convictions but having led a hard-working and productive life. The Judge said he took into account the impact of prison on a man sent there for the first time at the age this offender was. Secondly, the judge took into account in mitigation his repeated expressions of remorse for what he had done and the effect it had had on the family of his victims. The judge said that the third letter made his express remorse ""somewhat equivocal"" by placing it in the context of his perceived duty to the family and his views about the Family Courts; but that the best evidence of remorse was the early guilty pleas. Remorse was therefore, he said, some mitigation. Thirdly, the Judge rejected the suggestion that the offender had been ""provoked"" within the meaning of para.10(d) of sch.21. But he did take into account the stress suffered by the offender as a result of his wife's illness and death; his beliefs, which he described as ""distorted beliefs"", about the welfare of his grandson; and his recognition of his ""anger management"" issues and his increased use of alcohol during that time. The Judge said: ""It may not be helpful to analyse legally whether the mitigation is best described in the statutory terms as provocation or whether I take it into account as general mitigation that you have lived under great stress and anxiety for some time and this includes a period which had nothing to do with your grandson or the [D] family but was during the care of your wife and her death in December 2019. This stress and anxiety continued in your involvement in your grandson's life. I accept that you clearly loved your grandson and this led to you becoming overwrought about the family contact disputes. This provides background to these offences which I take into account in mitigation."" The Judge said that having considered all the aggravating and mitigating features as he had explained them, he would have fixed the minimum term at 30 years, after a trial. He then gave maximum credit for the offender's guilty pleas, thereby reducing the minimum term to 25 years, further reduced to give credit for time spent on remand of 206 days. Submissions On behalf of the Solicitor General, Ms Ledward KC accepted that the judge had been entitled to decline to impose a whole life order, although she submitted that this case was on the borderline of requiring such a tariff. She also accepted that he correctly applied the maximum discount for the offender's pleas of guilty. Her submissions may be summarised as follows: (1) The offending involved the murder of two persons and, for that reason alone, this was a case of at least ""particularly high"" seriousness which for that reason alone required a starting point in determining the minimum term of 30 years. (2) The aggravating features were then that: (i) the murders involved the use of a firearm (a factor also listed in para.3 as normally resulting independently in a 30-year starting point); (ii) the murders were intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice (a further factor listed in para.3); this was not a factor relied upon by the prosecution before the Judge, and therefore was not addressed during the sentencing exercise by the prosecution or by the defence or by the Judge; (iii) there was at least a significant degree of premeditation (a statutory aggravating factor under para.9); (iv) the victims were killed in their own homes, and (v) there was an impact on the local community. She accepted that the following mitigating factors applied: (i) lack of previous convictions and good character; (ii) remorse, albeit, as she characterised it, qualified; (iii) the offender's personal circumstances resulting in prolonged stress; and (iv) the age of the offender being such that he was very likely to die in prison. She submitted that having adopted the correct starting point of a 30-year minimum term, the Judge made two obvious errors which led (overall) to a third. The first was that he did not take into account that there were not two, but three factors listed in para.3 which were present. The second was that he wrongly concluded that to treat the presence of more than one para.3 factor as an additional aggravating factor would be to ""double-count"". Third, that as a result he lost sight of the fact that this was a case which, as she submitted, was arguably (by reason of the combination of aggravating features) on the borderline of meeting a whole life order, and which therefore warranted a significant uplift from a 30-year starting point, even when taking into account the mitigation which was present. Her submission was that all the circumstances required a minimum term which was nearer to 40 years than 30 years after a trial. The submissions by Mr Langdale KC on behalf of the offender may be summarised as follows. This was a difficult sentencing exercise in which the Judge took into account all the relevant factors. He started at the right starting point, he balanced the aggravating and mitigating factors, and reached a conclusion which was sound. It was not open to the Solicitor General on this reference to advance the argument that there was an intention to interfere with the course of justice when that had not been suggested to the Judge below. In any event such an intention was not supported by the evidence. The judge was entitled to treat the existence of two factors within para.3, namely a double murder and a murder with firearms, as both being taken into account in reaching a starting point of a 30-year term. The Judge was entitled to treat the aggravating and mitigating features as balancing themselves so as to arrive at a notional minimum term after a trial of 30 years. In his submission the sentence was not lenient. Alternatively, if lenient, it was not unduly so, which requires it to be less than an appropriate sentence by a considerable margin before this court is entitled to interfere. Discussion Approach to Schedule 21 It is important to keep in mind the guidance in R v Jones [2005] EWCA Crim 3115 , [2006] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 and subsequent case law as to how Schedule 21 is to be applied. The guidance given there is provided to assist the judge to determine the appropriate sentence. The judge must have regard to the guidance, but each case will depend critically on its particular facts. There are large gaps between the four starting points (15 years, 25 years, 30 years and whole life) which provide ""a very broad framework"" for the sentencing exercise. They are so far apart that it will often be impossible to divorce the choice of starting point from the application of aggravating and mitigating factors. This is expressly recognised by para.8 of sch.21. The starting points give the judge guidance as to the range within which the appropriate sentence is likely to fall having regard to the more salient features of the offences, but even then, as para.9 recognises, ""detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the making of a whole life order."" Full regard must be had to the features of the individual case so that the sentence truly reflects the seriousness of the particular offence and the individual circumstances of the offender. It is also important to keep in mind that, as this court said at para.19(iii) of Stewart , being in prison for a finite period of 30 years or more is a very severe penalty. Intention to interfere with the course of justice We agree with Mr Langdale's submission that the Solicitor General should not be allowed to argue that there was an intention to interfere with the course of justice in this court because it would be unfair to do so. We see no reason to doubt Mr Langdale's contention that if such a submission had been raised during the Crown Court proceedings, the defence would have drafted a basis of plea challenging such an assertion; and a trial of issue would have been required, because of the Crown's present submission that it would be make a difference to sentence, which it is assumed would also have been advanced at the time of the point being taken. A Newton Hearing would have been required. Mr Ledward relied on this court's decision AG's reference (Stewart ) [2016] EWCA Crim 2238 [2017] 1 Crim App R (S) 48 at [32]-[36], which is to the effect that where the prosecution make a concession as to offence categorisation within a guideline before the sentencing court, the Attorney General is not bound by such a concession on a reference, and the same applies to points not taken below. There are a number of authorities in this court to that effect. However, that proposition applies where and because the concession is not as to a matter of fact but simply as to a matter of judgment or evaluation of how undisputed facts are to be categorised or treated. The court made that clear in Stewart at [33]. By contrast, where the point which is conceded or not taken is a disputed fact, of which the Judge must be satisfied to a criminal standard, and which it would be unfairly prejudicial to be advanced for the first time on the reference, that reasoning does not apply. Moreover, we agree that on a fair reading of the material before the Judge it would be wrong to treat that as establishing to a criminal standard that the offender's intention was to frustrate the family proceedings. There was no evidence that the defendant gave any thought to trying to ""obstruct"" or ""interfere"" with the course of justice. The material is equally consistent with an increasing animosity towards JD which was of longstanding, driven by a perception of JD's deficient parenting of R, and exacerbated by JD's desire for greater contact; the animosity towards GD came from his support for JD in the family proceedings. The animosity was further exacerbated by the offender's frustration with the Family Court system which he thought should have ruled out of question any possibility of JD having any form of joint custody. It was this animosity towards the victims which led to the murders, rather than anything targeted at the family proceedings themselves. It was in this sense that the judge described the Family Court decision on 27 March as the trigger and the offender taking the law into his own hands. Ms Ledward submitted that it was clear that the offender acted as he did because he disagreed with the outcome of the family proceedings to date, which he viewed as a grave mistake. She submitted that where there was a murder of a party to such proceedings, in which a murderer is dissatisfied with the course that the proceedings are taking, that must surely amount to a murder that was intended to interfere with the course of those proceedings. She submitted that the offender's motive was quite clearly to affect the course of those proceedings and the inescapable inference is that that was not only the motive but that he acted with the intention of changing or interfering with the outcome of those proceedings by removing those who were pursuing the opposing case. We would not accept that that is an inescapable inference. Intention depends upon what subjectively is in the offender's mind, not merely the objective effect of his conduct, however foreseeable. His animosity towards his victims had been heightened by his frustration at the outcome of the latest stage of the proceedings, but that cannot automatically be equated with an intention to interfere with the proceedings by carrying out the murders. However, having said that, we nevertheless observe that interference with the course of the proceedings was undoubtedly the effect of the conduct of the offender. That is, in our view, an aggravating feature which was not taken into account by the Judge. That is a matter to which we will return. Double counting for two factors within para.3 It was an error of principle for the judge to say that treating the fact that there were two factors mentioned in para.3, namely a double murder and the use of firearms, did not require an increase because that would involve double-counting. On the facts of this case it would not do so. Parliament has indicated that a double murder is of itself something which normally puts the offending in the category of very high seriousness so as to attract a starting point of 30 years for that reason. The statute also requires a single murder using a firearm normally to be treated as of the same seriousness, warranting a starting point of 30 years for that feature alone. The statute treats such a single firearm murder as significantly more serious than, for example, one with a knife, for which the starting point is set at 25 years if taken to the scene. It is of course important that sch.21 is not applied mechanistically, but it follows from what we have said that parliament must have intended that if there were two murders which would of themselves normally require a starting point of 30 years, a significant upward adjustment would be appropriate if there were the use of the firearm in each case, at least where, as in this case, there was no necessary connection between the two features by reason of the nature of the offending. Aggravating and mitigating features This was a case of particularly high seriousness because there were two murders. These were not, as sometimes happens, two victims at a scene killed in rapid succession in the course of a single incident. These murders involved two separate incidents, separated in time, separated in place, with their own individual premeditation and planning, and with travel between them and reloading of the shotgun in between. The use of firearms was an important aggravating feature, as we have said, requiring a significant upwards adjustment measured in years. Further aggravation is to be found in the significant degree of planning and premeditation, which was accurately described by the judge as stretching back for a considerable period, at least contingently. The offending is also made more serious because by the shooting of JD offender intended to deprive a seven-year-old child of his father forever. That was a specific motivation for his murder. That is an aggravating feature quite apart from the intention to deprive the child of his grandfather as well, and apart from the impact on the wider family attested to in the victim impact statement. It is also significant that, as we have said, the effect of the conduct was to interfere with the course of justice. The function of the court in the family proceedings was to look after the best interests and welfare of R. The murders prevented the court from considering the extent to which that would be served by contact with JD or custody with him. The murders put an end to the dispute between S and JD by the offender taking the law into his own hands. That is a serious interference with the administration of justice which was the foreseeable result of what this offender did, even if it formed no part of his motivational intention. That does not go to increase his culpability, but it does increase the harm caused by the offence. Further aggravation is to be found in the murders taking place in the victims' own homes where they were entitled to feel safe. Against these aggravating factors, the mitigation was of more limited weight. In accordance with the guidance of this court in R v Clarke [2017] EWCA Crim 393 , [2017] 2 Cr App R (S) 18 , old age and extreme old age in prison, and ill health or foreseeable potential ill health which may accompany old age, are mitigating factors because of the extent to which they may make the sentence more onerous. They are however, as that case said, to be taken into account ""in a limited way"" because the harm and culpability of the offending are the principal factors to be taken into account in sentencing serious offending of this nature. Under the minimum term imposed by the judge, the offender would in any event be in his early to mid-90s, if still alive, when he first became eligible to apply to the Parole Board for release. Similarly, good character does not count for a great deal in offending of this nature. We recognise that the stress which had affected the offender was something to be taken into account in his favour. It could not be treated as lessening his culpability to a very substantial extent, given the nature of the murders and their significant planning, but it did form, as the judge said, some mitigation. Moreover, there was remorse, which is a separate consideration from pleading guilty, and also afforded some mitigation. However, the third letter from the offender did make this, as the judge observed, somewhat equivocal. We disagree with the judge's assessment that the aggravating and mitigating features could be taken as balancing each other out. In our view the aggravating features clearly outweighed the mitigation by some margin. We recognise that an assessment of the potency of aggravating and mitigating factors is not an exact science, and involves an evaluative judgement on which views of different sentencing judges may legitimately differ. Nevertheless, to treat the aggravating factors we have identified, which were of considerable weight, as entirely offset by the mitigating factors, which were of limited weight, was in our view well outside the range of any legitimate evaluation of them. Conclusion We have little hesitation in rejecting the submission made on behalf of the Solicitor General that this case fell ""on the borderline"" of meriting a whole life tariff. Applying the principles identified in R v Stewart it clearly did not. Nevertheless, taking all the circumstances of the offender and the offending into account, a minimum term, after a trial, of at least 35 years was called for, which after discount for a plea would be one of at least 30 years. It follows that in our view a minimum term of 25 years was not merely lenient but unduly so. We therefore grant leave to refer and we substitute on each count a sentence of life imprisonment of 30 years less 206 days spent on remand. _____________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2024/85.html","KGS, R. v [2024] EWCA Crim 85 (23 January 2024) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 85 No. 202304009 A2 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE POPPLEWELL MR JUSTICE CHOUDHURY HIS HONOUR JUDGE ANDREW LEES ____________________ REX - v - KGS REPORTING RESTRICTIONS AND ANONYMISATION APPLY : A order pursuant to s. 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 was made that no matter relating to the offender's grandson R shall be included in any publication of these proceedings or any judgment if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify him as a person concerned in the proceedings.

LANGDALE KC appeared on behalf of the Appellant. MS J. LEDWARD KC appeared on behalf of the Respondent. ____________________ ____________________ LORD JUSTICE POPPLEWELL: An order pursuant to s. 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 was made that no matter relating to the offender's grandson R shall be included in any publication of these proceedings or any judgment if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify him as a person concerned in the proceedings. This prohibition will last until he reaches his 18 th birthday. In order to protect his anonymity it has been necessary to anonymise the name of the offender, the victims, and other members of their family. This anonymity will also last only until R reaches his 18 th birthday. On the evening of 29 March 2023 the offender shot and killed JD, the former partner of his daughter, at point-blank range. He drove to the home of JD's father, GD, and shot and killed GD at point-blank range. He was soon apprehended, and made written admissions to the killings shortly thereafter. He pleaded guilty to two counts of murder on 28 June 2023 at an adjourned pre-trial preparation hearing once a psychiatric report had confirmed he was fit to plead. On 23 October 2023 he was sentenced by HHJ Bishop sitting in the Crown Court at Cambridge to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years less 206 days spent on remand on each count, to run concurrently. His Majesty's Solicitor General applies for leave to refer the sentences under s.36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 as unduly lenient. We emphasise at the outset that the minimum length of time which a murderer must serve in prison does not reflect the value of the lives taken away, and does not attempt to do so. The sentence, however long, and whatever the outcome of this application, can never compensate for the grievous loss which has been suffered by the families of the victims in this case. The Facts JD was 32 at the time of his death. He lived alone in a semi-detached house in Bluntisham, Cambridgeshire. His father, GD, was aged 57 at the time of his death. He too lived alone, in a house in Sutton, Cambridgeshire, some six miles away from JD's house. The offender, then aged 66, is a widower. Following the death of his wife in 2020, he sold his home and bought a motor home. At the time of the offending, he was living in that motor home on a campsite in Willingham, Cambridgeshire. He also owned a car. He was the holder of a shotgun licence and lawfully owned a Beretta shotgun. The catalyst for the shootings was a Family Court decision two days earlier, on 27 March 2023. Those proceedings were between the offender's daughter, S, and JD who was her former partner. They had been in a relationship and had a son, R, who was aged seven at the time of the shootings. S and JD had separated shortly after R was born. R lived with his mother but had regular contact with his father. In 2020 S married her current partner, Paul, and they had a daughter together. Paul is a US national who was serving with the US Airforce and was stationed in the UK but had been due to be redeployed back to the United States, and S and Paul planned to move there together with R and their daughter. The Family Court proceedings, which had been going on for some time, had involved disputes about contact and financial arrangements, and now involved an application by S to remove R from the jurisdiction so that he could go with her and Paul and their daughter to the United States. JD, R's father, opposed the application and submitted his own application to increase contact time to 50/50. The interim decision of the Family Court on 27 March 2023 was that JD's contact should not be increased to 50/50, but that R could not be removed from the jurisdiction pending further enquiries and further hearings. There were a number of communications prior to the shootings which were relied upon by the prosecution as evidence of planning. In particular, there were a number of text messages downloaded from the offender's mobile phone which, as the Judge concluded, showed that he was ""getting very involved in the family proceedings dispute between daughter and "". He also sent text messages over the preceding months, about which the judge said this: ""From the texts which have been produced the family proceedings have been troubling you to a significant degree over the year before the murders. Some of the texts indicate that you are thinking about taking the law into your own hands. The defence submit that these comments were bravado only but they were plainly more than that."" On 17 August 2022 there had been an exchange with someone called April in which the offender had said, ""I have a shortlist of people I intend to murder"". On 19 October 2022 he had said to April, ""I will override any court decision"", adding later ""first hearing end of November. But there is always a plan B."" The offender's telephone contained photographs of the houses occupied by both JD and GD and their vehicles, taken between November 2022 and early February 2023. These had been taken in connection with the family proceedings and were accompanied by commentary about contact arrangements, and financial aspects of the family proceedings, demonstrating the extent to which the offender was getting involved in those family proceedings. The Judge found that although those were not part of the planning for the murders, a by-product of that research was that the offender knew where the victims lived. On 27 March 2023, the day the Family Court made its interim ruling that R could not be removed from the jurisdiction pending further enquiries and hearing, the offender sent a message on his mobile telephone telling a friend ""I will be [R's] carer/guardian, and let and co move over to America. No problems. I'd kill a host of individuals but implication spread out too wide."" There was evidence that at around this time (and on the day of the murders) the offender was making enquiries about viewing properties to rent. On the morning of the murders the offender drove his car to Meridian Close where JD lived, and remained there for about two minutes. He then drove to The Row in Sutton where GD lived, arriving ten minutes later and pausing there for a few seconds. The offender's car was seen again later and briefly in Meridian Close at 3.20 in the afternoon and again at about 4.40. At half past seven in the evening, the offender began a series of checks designed to ensure that the two victims were home and alone for the evening. He drove onto The Row in Sutton. On that occasion, GD returned to his home in his van a few minutes later and the offender drove past GD's home address before leaving the street. At about quarter to eight, he drove into Meridian Close and waited there for about a minute. He repeated that at about five past eight. At about 8.40 he drove along The Row and parked up at the side of the road. He went up to the van parked outside GD's home address before leaving. Shortly before nine o'clock, he drove into Meridian Close again and parked up. At around nine o'clock, JD's girlfriend left his home, having spent the evening there with JD. She drove home, leaving JD alone in his house. Very shortly after her departure, the offender went up to the front door of J's house, carrying his loaded shotgun. He knocked on the front door. When JD opened the front door, the offender shot him at point-blank range, to the left chest and then to the right side of his head. The injuries were rapidly fatal. Alerted by the shots, neighbours emerged from their homes and saw the offender walking from the front door, having closed it behind him, carrying the shotgun which he placed on the backseat of his car before driving off. The neighbours called 999 and soon found JD's body, where he had collapsed in the hallway of his home. The offender drove straight to The Row in Sutton, where his car was seen shortly before 9.15. He parked up. A lady walking a dog noticed him doing something in the boot with a dark long-shaped object, which was undoubtedly the shotgun. He appeared startled by her presence. Within a couple of minutes, at 9.17, the offender knocked on GD's front door. When GD opened the door, the offender shot him three times at point-blank range, to the top of the head, the right chest and the left hip. In fact, four shots had been fired, one of them missing, indicating that the offender had reloaded the two-barrel gun at the scene. Those injuries would have been rapidly fatal. The offender then closed the front door, and left the scene in his car. He drove to the caravan site in Willingham where he had been living, placed the shotgun in a cupboard in his motor home, and drove away in that vehicle, intending, it seems, to drive to Bristol. He was very quickly identified by the police as the murder suspect and that night his motor home was brought to a stop by the police on the M5 at about 1.30 am. He was arrested on suspicion of murder and told the arresting officer where the shotgun was. He was taken to Worcester police station. During the booking-in procedure, he was heard to say ""Sometimes you have to do what you have to do, even if it is wrong in the eyes of the law."" He later said he was very remorseful. He was transferred to Parkside police station in Cambridge, and interviewed under caution in the presence of a solicitor. He answered ""no comment"" to all questions asked. He was charged with murder. He was not arraigned at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing scheduled for 11 May 2023 as a psychiatric report was being prepared as to fitness to plead. He sent the first of three letters to the court on 18 May, a week later, in which he confessed to the two murders and said he had intended to plead guilty at the hearing on 11 May. He said: ""I am struggling with the burden of my guilt and wish to bring to a closure the suffering and emotional stress that my actions on this tragic and fatal night have caused ... if I could turn back time I would and I regret that there are not enough words or remorse I can offer to the families affected by this crime."" He sent a second letter to the court dated 30 May 2023, in which he offered a lengthy explanation of his personal circumstances, and which made plain the connection between his actions and his feelings resulting from the outcome of the Family Court hearing. He set out his personal history from the time when his wife was diagnosed with cancer, and the difficulties faced by him over the following years in having to care for her alone until her death. He indicated that he had used alcohol in order to manage his stress and his anguish. In that letter he made a number of derogatory assertions about JD's care of his child R, which were not accepted by the prosecution. At the adjourned Pre-trial Preparation Hearing on 28 June, the offender pleaded guilty to the two counts of murder on the indictment. Shortly before the sentencing hearing, on 20 October 2023, a third letter written by the offender was uploaded to the Digital Case System. The content of that letter is important. Much of it repeats that which the offender had previously set out in his earlier letters. He said that his actions were ""driven"" by the actions of JD, encouraged by his father GD, and the offender's overwhelming desire to protect his grandson: ""My action has been driven by the physical and emotional abuse from his biological male parent and the failure of the family courts ... I would not and cannot condone what happened but love can be blind and be the catalyst for tragedy. This is a crime of passion."" ""During these years of caring for my wife and acting as [R's] father and grandfather, I would acknowledge I developed anger management issues towards [JD & GD] over their mistreatment of ."" He said that when he received a letter from JD's solicitors advising that JD would be making an application to the Family Court for greater contact ""from this moment on I struggled to manage my anger, stress, anxiety, and the red mist brought on by my growing alcohol dependency. But despite my rage moments, I never planned any harm and am ashamed of the events of 29 March."" He said that the decision of the Family Court on 27 March: ""May have been the point where the straw broke the camel's back, but I tried hard to control my anger."" The decision was, in his words, ""a catastrophic error of judgment which would ruin 's life"" and which had ""pushed me over the edge"": ""The court had failed and thus failed me. The decision proved to be catalyst for all of the dark thoughts I was struggling to manage and control. I had failed . In my mind had destroyed in an instance (sic) and this was born from his own interests. My grandchildren have now been placed in care for the crimes of their grandfather. I despise myself for all the hurt I have caused and am continuing to cause."" ""I was in a fragile state of the mind at the time but I would never seek to use my mental health to defend this act."" He continued to express his remorse for his actions, somewhat qualified by his explanations. The letter concluded: ""Unfortunately, I am driven by a duty, and human instinct to protect and care for the ones I love. I accept this should not have been at the expense of the law, but I do not believe the family courts are fit for purpose"". The final two paragraphs made further criticisms of the working of the Family Courts generally. Sentencing The offender had no previous convictions or cautions recorded against him. When sentencing there were no reports before the court. Although a psychiatric report had been obtained during the course of the proceedings, it was not served on the court and no reliance was placed upon it by the defence at any stage, including at the sentencing hearing. Having raised the matter explicitly with defence counsel, the judge was satisfied that he did not need to obtain a psychiatric report before sentencing the offender. The judge had victim personal statements which detailed the devastating effects which the murder had had on the family of the two victims. In advance of the sentencing hearing, prosecution counsel had prepared a sentencing note setting out the facts, the relevant statutory provisions and the applicable guidelines. The defence also put forward a sentencing note. The relevant law and guidelines The mandatory sentence for an offence of murder committed by an adult is imprisonment for life (s.321 of the Sentencing Act 2020). In fixing the minimum term, the Sentencing Act requires the court to have regard to sch.21 of that Act in doing so, and to any other relevant guidelines which are not incompatible with that schedule. In respect of adult offenders, sch.21 sets four starting points in fixing the minimum term. They are starting points which are expressed to be those which will ""normally"" apply depending on the presence of specific features. They are a whole life order, a minimum term of 30 years, a minimum term of 25 years, and a minimum term of 15 years. So far as relevant, sch.21 states as follows: ""Starting points 2(1) If (a) the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is exceptionally high, and (b) the offender was aged 21 or over when the offence was committed, the appropriate starting point is a whole life order. (2) Cases that would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include (a) the murder of two or more persons, where each murder involves any of the following (i) a substantial degree of premeditation or planning. [...] 3(1) If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 2(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when the offence was committed, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years. (2) Cases that (if not falling within paragraph 2(1)) would normally fall within sub-paragraph (1)(a) include [...] (b) a murder involving the use of a firearm or explosive, [...] (d) a murder intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice. [...] (f) the murder of two or more persons. [...] Aggravating and mitigating factors 7. Having chosen a starting point, the court should take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors, to the extent that it has not allowed for them in its choice of starting point. 8. Detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the making of a whole life order. 9. Aggravating factors (additional to those mentioned in paragraphs 2(2), 3(2) ... ) that may be relevant to the offence of murder include (a) a significant degree of planning or premeditation. [...] 10. Mitigating factors that may be relevant to the offence of murder include [...] (d) the fact that the offender was provoked (for example, by prolonged stress) but, in the case of a murder committed before 4 October 2010, in a way not amounting to a defence of provocation."" There was no dispute that a life sentence was mandatory and the only question was setting the minimum term. The prosecution contended that there was an element of premeditation and planning, which the court could consider to be a ""substantial degree"" of premeditation or planning for both murders, and that the court could find that the seriousness of the offences was ""exceptionally high"" within the meaning of para.2 so as to warrant a whole life order. The court's attention was drawn to the guideline case of R v Stewart and others [2022] EWCA Crim 1063 ; [2023] 1 Crim App R (S) 17 on the imposition of whole life terms. The prosecution submitted in the alternative that if the seriousness was not ""exceptionally high"", the case fell clearly within para.3 as one of ""particularly high"" seriousness as it involved the murder of two persons and the use of a firearm, such that the starting point would be one of 30 years. It was suggested that the aggravating features present comprised the presence of two qualifying factors under para.3, that is to say the use of a firearm and the murder of more than one person; the element of planning and premeditation; the fact that the victims were in their own home; and the effect on the surrounding community, which was said to make this equivalent to ""a killing in public"". The court was referred to the Sentencing Council's guideline on ""reduction in sentence for a guilty plea"", which provides that the minimum term should be reduced in the case of a guilty plea to murder, but that such a reduction should not exceed one-sixth of the minimum term, and can never be more than a reduction of five years. On behalf of the offender, the defence submitted to the Judge that the case was not one of exceptionally high seriousness and that the degree of planning for each murder fell short of that which was required to place the case within para.2 of sch.21. It was accepted that the case fell within the category of ""particularly high seriousness"" described in para.3 by reason of the two factors identified, and as such a 30-year starting point was appropriate. It was submitted that the text messages relied upon by the prosecution did not establish, to the criminal standard, that the offender had formed any murderous intent months or weeks before the murders. Any planning or premeditation it was submitted was not ""significant"" and thus there was no statutory aggravating factor of the kind listed in para.9 of sch.21. It was suggested that the offender had only formed a murderous intent when JD's girlfriend left his home on the evening in question, and that the previous visits earlier in the afternoon and evening did not establish premeditation, albeit that it was accepted that the offender had at least made preparation for such an outcome by taking the shotgun in the evening. It was submitted that the mitigating factors outlined in para.10(d) of sch.21 (i.e. ""the fact that the offender was provoked (for example by prolonged stress) but ... in a way not amounting to a defence of provocation"") was present in this case, and required a significant downward reduction to be applied to the minimum term. It was submitted that this was a subjective test, based on what the defendant perceived and what ultimately caused the ""prolonged stress"" which led to him mentally collapsing in a way which led to the commission of the offence. It was also submitted that, inevitably, the offender would die in prison because of his age, and as such his sentence should be further reduced to reflect his age; and further for his lack of previous convictions and for his positive good character. Reliance was also placed on his obvious remorse and on his plea of guilty. Having heard submissions from the crown and the defence on Friday, 20 October 2023, the Judge adjourned to give the matter further consideration over the weekend and pass sentence on the following Monday, 23 October. He described the murders as ""executions"" motivated by the offender's distorted beliefs over the Family Court proceedings in respect of the care of his grandson. Dissatisfied with the decision made at the interim hearing to preserve the status quo, the offender had taken the law into his own hands and ended the lives of two innocent men. Having reviewed the decision of this court in Stewart , the judge concluded that the murders did not fall within para.2 of sch.21 as requiring a whole life order. Instead, para.3 applied, and the seriousness was ""particularly high"" so as to attract a 30-year starting point, on the grounds that there were two murders and a firearm was used. He found that there were additional aggravating factors comprising the following. First, what he characterised as a significant degree of premeditation and planning in the light of (a) the texts earlier in 2022 about taking the law into his own hands, (b) his beliefs about the Family Court ruling, (c) the repeated visits on the day to the victim's home and (d) the offender having a shotgun with him by the evening at latest. Secondly, there was the aggravating factor of both victims being in their homes where they were entitled to be safe. Thirdly, there was an impact on the community, which was an aggravating factor (although the judge did not go so far as to equate this with a ""killing in public""). When it came to aggravating and mitigating factors, the judge said that although two factors referred to in para.3 were present, he declined to treat this as an aggravating feature, saying ""I have already taken into account in arriving at the correct minimum term, so I do not double-count those aspects."" The judge then found that the following mitigation fell to be taken into account. First, the offender's age and previous good character, not just an absence of convictions but having led a hard-working and productive life. The Judge said he took into account the impact of prison on a man sent there for the first time at the age this offender was. Secondly, the judge took into account in mitigation his repeated expressions of remorse for what he had done and the effect it had had on the family of his victims. The judge said that the third letter made his express remorse ""somewhat equivocal"" by placing it in the context of his perceived duty to the family and his views about the Family Courts; but that the best evidence of remorse was the early guilty pleas. Remorse was therefore, he said, some mitigation. Thirdly, the Judge rejected the suggestion that the offender had been ""provoked"" within the meaning of para.10(d) of sch.21. But he did take into account the stress suffered by the offender as a result of his wife's illness and death; his beliefs, which he described as ""distorted beliefs"", about the welfare of his grandson; and his recognition of his ""anger management"" issues and his increased use of alcohol during that time. The Judge said: ""It may not be helpful to analyse legally whether the mitigation is best described in the statutory terms as provocation or whether I take it into account as general mitigation that you have lived under great stress and anxiety for some time and this includes a period which had nothing to do with your grandson or the family but was during the care of your wife and her death in December 2019. This stress and anxiety continued in your involvement in your grandson's life. I accept that you clearly loved your grandson and this led to you becoming overwrought about the family contact disputes. This provides background to these offences which I take into account in mitigation."" The Judge said that having considered all the aggravating and mitigating features as he had explained them, he would have fixed the minimum term at 30 years, after a trial. He then gave maximum credit for the offender's guilty pleas, thereby reducing the minimum term to 25 years, further reduced to give credit for time spent on remand of 206 days. Submissions On behalf of the Solicitor General, Ms Ledward KC accepted that the judge had been entitled to decline to impose a whole life order, although she submitted that this case was on the borderline of requiring such a tariff. She also accepted that he correctly applied the maximum discount for the offender's pleas of guilty. Her submissions may be summarised as follows: (1) The offending involved the murder of two persons and, for that reason alone, this was a case of at least ""particularly high"" seriousness which for that reason alone required a starting point in determining the minimum term of 30 years. (2) The aggravating features were then that: (i) the murders involved the use of a firearm (a factor also listed in para.3 as normally resulting independently in a 30-year starting point); (ii) the murders were intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice (a further factor listed in para.3); this was not a factor relied upon by the prosecution before the Judge, and therefore was not addressed during the sentencing exercise by the prosecution or by the defence or by the Judge; (iii) there was at least a significant degree of premeditation (a statutory aggravating factor under para.9); (iv) the victims were killed in their own homes, and (v) there was an impact on the local community. She accepted that the following mitigating factors applied: (i) lack of previous convictions and good character; (ii) remorse, albeit, as she characterised it, qualified; (iii) the offender's personal circumstances resulting in prolonged stress; and (iv) the age of the offender being such that he was very likely to die in prison. She submitted that having adopted the correct starting point of a 30-year minimum term, the Judge made two obvious errors which led (overall) to a third. The first was that he did not take into account that there were not two, but three factors listed in para.3 which were present. The second was that he wrongly concluded that to treat the presence of more than one para.3 factor as an additional aggravating factor would be to ""double-count"". Third, that as a result he lost sight of the fact that this was a case which, as she submitted, was arguably (by reason of the combination of aggravating features) on the borderline of meeting a whole life order, and which therefore warranted a significant uplift from a 30-year starting point, even when taking into account the mitigation which was present. Her submission was that all the circumstances required a minimum term which was nearer to 40 years than 30 years after a trial. The submissions by Mr Langdale KC on behalf of the offender may be summarised as follows. This was a difficult sentencing exercise in which the Judge took into account all the relevant factors. He started at the right starting point, he balanced the aggravating and mitigating factors, and reached a conclusion which was sound. It was not open to the Solicitor General on this reference to advance the argument that there was an intention to interfere with the course of justice when that had not been suggested to the Judge below. In any event such an intention was not supported by the evidence. The judge was entitled to treat the existence of two factors within para.3, namely a double murder and a murder with firearms, as both being taken into account in reaching a starting point of a 30-year term. The Judge was entitled to treat the aggravating and mitigating features as balancing themselves so as to arrive at a notional minimum term after a trial of 30 years. In his submission the sentence was not lenient. Alternatively, if lenient, it was not unduly so, which requires it to be less than an appropriate sentence by a considerable margin before this court is entitled to interfere. Discussion Approach to Schedule 21 It is important to keep in mind the guidance in R v Jones [2005] EWCA Crim 3115 , [2006] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 and subsequent case law as to how Schedule 21 is to be applied. The guidance given there is provided to assist the judge to determine the appropriate sentence. The judge must have regard to the guidance, but each case will depend critically on its particular facts. There are large gaps between the four starting points (15 years, 25 years, 30 years and whole life) which provide ""a very broad framework"" for the sentencing exercise. They are so far apart that it will often be impossible to divorce the choice of starting point from the application of aggravating and mitigating factors. This is expressly recognised by para.8 of sch.21. The starting points give the judge guidance as to the range within which the appropriate sentence is likely to fall having regard to the more salient features of the offences, but even then, as para.9 recognises, ""detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the making of a whole life order."" Full regard must be had to the features of the individual case so that the sentence truly reflects the seriousness of the particular offence and the individual circumstances of the offender. It is also important to keep in mind that, as this court said at para.19(iii) of Stewart , being in prison for a finite period of 30 years or more is a very severe penalty. Intention to interfere with the course of justice We agree with Mr Langdale's submission that the Solicitor General should not be allowed to argue that there was an intention to interfere with the course of justice in this court because it would be unfair to do so. We see no reason to doubt Mr Langdale's contention that if such a submission had been raised during the Crown Court proceedings, the defence would have drafted a basis of plea challenging such an assertion; and a trial of issue would have been required, because of the Crown's present submission that it would be make a difference to sentence, which it is assumed would also have been advanced at the time of the point being taken. A Newton Hearing would have been required. Mr Ledward relied on this court's decision AG's reference (Stewart ) [2016] EWCA Crim 2238 [2017] 1 Crim App R (S) 48 at [32]-[36], which is to the effect that where the prosecution make a concession as to offence categorisation within a guideline before the sentencing court, the Attorney General is not bound by such a concession on a reference, and the same applies to points not taken below. There are a number of authorities in this court to that effect. However, that proposition applies where and because the concession is not as to a matter of fact but simply as to a matter of judgment or evaluation of how undisputed facts are to be categorised or treated. The court made that clear in Stewart at [33]. By contrast, where the point which is conceded or not taken is a disputed fact, of which the Judge must be satisfied to a criminal standard, and which it would be unfairly prejudicial to be advanced for the first time on the reference, that reasoning does not apply. Moreover, we agree that on a fair reading of the material before the Judge it would be wrong to treat that as establishing to a criminal standard that the offender's intention was to frustrate the family proceedings. There was no evidence that the defendant gave any thought to trying to ""obstruct"" or ""interfere"" with the course of justice. The material is equally consistent with an increasing animosity towards JD which was of longstanding, driven by a perception of JD's deficient parenting of R, and exacerbated by JD's desire for greater contact; the animosity towards GD came from his support for JD in the family proceedings. The animosity was further exacerbated by the offender's frustration with the Family Court system which he thought should have ruled out of question any possibility of JD having any form of joint custody. It was this animosity towards the victims which led to the murders, rather than anything targeted at the family proceedings themselves. It was in this sense that the judge described the Family Court decision on 27 March as the trigger and the offender taking the law into his own hands. Ms Ledward submitted that it was clear that the offender acted as he did because he disagreed with the outcome of the family proceedings to date, which he viewed as a grave mistake. She submitted that where there was a murder of a party to such proceedings, in which a murderer is dissatisfied with the course that the proceedings are taking, that must surely amount to a murder that was intended to interfere with the course of those proceedings. She submitted that the offender's motive was quite clearly to affect the course of those proceedings and the inescapable inference is that that was not only the motive but that he acted with the intention of changing or interfering with the outcome of those proceedings by removing those who were pursuing the opposing case. We would not accept that that is an inescapable inference. Intention depends upon what subjectively is in the offender's mind, not merely the objective effect of his conduct, however foreseeable. His animosity towards his victims had been heightened by his frustration at the outcome of the latest stage of the proceedings, but that cannot automatically be equated with an intention to interfere with the proceedings by carrying out the murders. However, having said that, we nevertheless observe that interference with the course of the proceedings was undoubtedly the effect of the conduct of the offender. That is, in our view, an aggravating feature which was not taken into account by the Judge. That is a matter to which we will return. Double counting for two factors within para.3 It was an error of principle for the judge to say that treating the fact that there were two factors mentioned in para.3, namely a double murder and the use of firearms, did not require an increase because that would involve double-counting. On the facts of this case it would not do so. Parliament has indicated that a double murder is of itself something which normally puts the offending in the category of very high seriousness so as to attract a starting point of 30 years for that reason. The statute also requires a single murder using a firearm normally to be treated as of the same seriousness, warranting a starting point of 30 years for that feature alone. The statute treats such a single firearm murder as significantly more serious than, for example, one with a knife, for which the starting point is set at 25 years if taken to the scene. It is of course important that sch.21 is not applied mechanistically, but it follows from what we have said that parliament must have intended that if there were two murders which would of themselves normally require a starting point of 30 years, a significant upward adjustment would be appropriate if there were the use of the firearm in each case, at least where, as in this case, there was no necessary connection between the two features by reason of the nature of the offending. Aggravating and mitigating features This was a case of particularly high seriousness because there were two murders. These were not, as sometimes happens, two victims at a scene killed in rapid succession in the course of a single incident. These murders involved two separate incidents, separated in time, separated in place, with their own individual premeditation and planning, and with travel between them and reloading of the shotgun in between. The use of firearms was an important aggravating feature, as we have said, requiring a significant upwards adjustment measured in years. Further aggravation is to be found in the significant degree of planning and premeditation, which was accurately described by the judge as stretching back for a considerable period, at least contingently. The offending is also made more serious because by the shooting of JD offender intended to deprive a seven-year-old child of his father forever. That was a specific motivation for his murder. That is an aggravating feature quite apart from the intention to deprive the child of his grandfather as well, and apart from the impact on the wider family attested to in the victim impact statement. It is also significant that, as we have said, the effect of the conduct was to interfere with the course of justice. The function of the court in the family proceedings was to look after the best interests and welfare of R. The murders prevented the court from considering the extent to which that would be served by contact with JD or custody with him. The murders put an end to the dispute between S and JD by the offender taking the law into his own hands. That is a serious interference with the administration of justice which was the foreseeable result of what this offender did, even if it formed no part of his motivational intention. That does not go to increase his culpability, but it does increase the harm caused by the offence. Further aggravation is to be found in the murders taking place in the victims' own homes where they were entitled to feel safe. Against these aggravating factors, the mitigation was of more limited weight. In accordance with the guidance of this court in R v Clarke [2017] EWCA Crim 393 , [2017] 2 Cr App R (S) 18 , old age and extreme old age in prison, and ill health or foreseeable potential ill health which may accompany old age, are mitigating factors because of the extent to which they may make the sentence more onerous. They are however, as that case said, to be taken into account ""in a limited way"" because the harm and culpability of the offending are the principal factors to be taken into account in sentencing serious offending of this nature. Under the minimum term imposed by the judge, the offender would in any event be in his early to mid-90s, if still alive, when he first became eligible to apply to the Parole Board for release. Similarly, good character does not count for a great deal in offending of this nature. We recognise that the stress which had affected the offender was something to be taken into account in his favour. It could not be treated as lessening his culpability to a very substantial extent, given the nature of the murders and their significant planning, but it did form, as the judge said, some mitigation. Moreover, there was remorse, which is a separate consideration from pleading guilty, and also afforded some mitigation. However, the third letter from the offender did make this, as the judge observed, somewhat equivocal. We disagree with the judge's assessment that the aggravating and mitigating features could be taken as balancing each other out. In our view the aggravating features clearly outweighed the mitigation by some margin. We recognise that an assessment of the potency of aggravating and mitigating factors is not an exact science, and involves an evaluative judgement on which views of different sentencing judges may legitimately differ. Nevertheless, to treat the aggravating factors we have identified, which were of considerable weight, as entirely offset by the mitigating factors, which were of limited weight, was in our view well outside the range of any legitimate evaluation of them. Conclusion We have little hesitation in rejecting the submission made on behalf of the Solicitor General that this case fell ""on the borderline"" of meriting a whole life tariff. Applying the principles identified in R v Stewart it clearly did not. Nevertheless, taking all the circumstances of the offender and the offending into account, a minimum term, after a trial, of at least 35 years was called for, which after discount for a plea would be one of at least 30 years. It follows that in our view a minimum term of 25 years was not merely lenient but unduly so. We therefore grant leave to refer and we substitute on each count a sentence of life imprisonment of 30 years less 206 days spent on remand. _____________"

He was almost 16 years and 3 months old when, just before 5pm on 2 nd June 2018, he and others murdered Tavis Spencer-Aitken (aged 17) in Ipswich in a gang-related revenge attack. Following a lengthy trial in the Crown Court at Ipswich before His Honour Judge Levett and a jury, the appellant and three others were convicted of murder and another of manslaughter. On 30 th April 2019, the appellant was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, with a minimum term of 21 years (less 327 days spent on remand in custody to count towards it). The appellant now appeals against sentence by limited leave of the single judge. On the appellant's behalf, Mr Bentley QC, for whose written and oral submissions we are grateful, submits: (i) That the increase to 21 years from the 12 year statutory starting point for a defendant aged 16 was far too great: (ii) The judge paid insufficient regard to the age of the appellant, and of its effect on his culpability; (iii) The judge paid insufficient regard to the personal circumstances of the appellant, as described in the pre-sentence report; (iv) The sentences for the three adult co-defendants demonstrate that the judge allowed insufficient disparity between their minimum terms and that imposed upon the appellant, given the different applicable statutory starting points. The co-accused nearest in age to the appellant was Isaac Calver, whose date of birth was 28 th September 1999. Thus, he was almost 19 at the time of the murder - two and a half years older than the appellant. He, too, received a minimum term of 21 years for the offence of murder. Aristote Yenge was aged 22 at the time of the murder. He received a minimum term of 25 years. Adbayo Amusa was almost 20 at the time of the offence. He received a minimum of 23 years. The Facts The appellant had been a member of a gang called ""J Block"" since he was only 13 years old. The deceased was associated with a rival gang called ""Neno"", or ""The Three"" (a reference to its postcode location within Ipswich). The facts underlying the murder are truly appalling. They illustrate the pernicious, destructive and evil influence of gang culture on young people. Earlier in the day of 2 nd June 2018, the appellant and Yenge had been in Ipswich town centre. They had been chased by two members of the Neno gang. They took refuge in a shop. An off-duty police officer intervened. Rather than leave the matter alone, they decided to exact some revenge. The appellant and Yenge went to a nearby house, where the appellant made contact by telephone with a range of members of J Block who then assembled in a nearby park. They drove to Nacton, the home territory in Ipswich of the Neno gang, armed with knives. Their purpose was to seek out a member of that gang to exact revenge. It appears that the deceased was the first member of that gang they saw. They set upon him in the street, close to his home. Between them, they stabbed him 15 times. He died shortly afterwards in hospital. This is a tragedy spoken to eloquently in the Victim Personal Statements we have read from the deceased's mother, his father and his grandmother. His sister cradled her dying brother in her arms on the pavement. The Sentencing Remarks The judge set out his reasoning for arriving at each of the sentences, and by setting them in the overall context of what had occurred, with meticulous clarity. His material conclusions so far as the appellant was concerned were these: (i) The appellant had been responsible for corralling the group which proceeded to kill the deceased. Despite his age, the appellant was influential in the gang. (ii) The attack was a premeditated, targeted revenge attack. (iii) The appellant - and indeed the others convicted of murder - had an intention to kill the deceased. (iv) The appellant and Yenge took the two knives used in the attack to the scene, but all knew that knives were there and to be used. (v) Overall, the appellant had a prominent, leading role in what occurred. (vi) The killing was the result of a long-standing hostility between the gangs. (vii) All the co-accused had taken care to turn off their telephones to avoid the possibility of their movements being traced. After the attack, they not only disposed of their weapons, but also washed their bodies and clothes in an attempt to eliminate forensic traces. In sentencing the appellant to a minimum term of 21 years, the judge took into account the appellant's disturbed background, to which we will return, but took the view that the Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline which sets out overarching principles for sentencing children and young people had no direct application to sentencing for murder. It may well be that he reached that conclusion as a result of a footnote at the beginning of the guideline, which reads: ""This section does not apply when imposing a mandatory life sentence, when imposing a statutory minimum custodial sentence, when imposing a detention for life under the dangerous offender provisions or when making certain orders under the Mental Health Act 1983"". He made it clear that the guideline had no application in the sense that the usual factors applicable in sentencing young people would not be in play. Nonetheless, he considered that youth and immaturity were relevant factors. However, that footnote is concerned only with the general approach to sentencing children and young people found in section one of the guideline. As part of the background information available to him, the judge noted that the appellant had been a professional Class A drug dealer since he was 13. The appellant had explained this in his evidence by way of background. The appellant had convictions for battery and threatening with an offensive weapon when he was aged 14 and threatening behaviour when he was 15. He had also been cautioned for battery. The judge's overall conclusion was that the age difference between the appellant and his co accused also convicted of murder was of much less importance than would at first sight appear. The Pre-Sentence Report The detailed pre-sentence report illuminated the path followed by this 16 year old appellant enroute to becoming a murderer. He lived with his mother, but spent much time, both as a young child and since, with his father who was not only a heavy drug user, but also a drug dealer. When he was with his father, he mixed in an environment which included many other people who both took hard drugs and dealt in hard drugs. From a very young age, such an environment was the appellant's normal way of life. In short, it is the environment into which he was born. He was also subject to, and witnessed, violence as a child. That, too, was normal for him from a very early age. By the time he was 11 years of age, he was a habitual cannabis user. By the age of 13, he was a user of and became addicted to liquid codeine. His early gang involvement arose at about the same age, as did his becoming a drug dealer. His involvement with the gang led to violent attacks on his mother's home, which precipitated more than one relocation. The appellant himself had been stabbed in a gang-related attack when he was aged 14. The General Approach to Sentencing in Murder Cases Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 applies to the determination of the minimum term. For adults (those 18 and over), the starting point for the minimum term is generally 15 years, but with a higher starting point in a range of circumstances. One of those circumstances is when a knife is used and taken to the scene of the murder. If that is established, the starting point for an adult is 25 years. The starting point applied by the judge in the cases of the three co accused convicted of murder was that enhanced starting point. By contrast, the starting point for offenders under the age of 18 is 12 years. There are no comparable higher starting points specified by the statute for young murderers who, if adults at the time of offending, would have been subject to enhanced minimum terms. The starting point for young offenders covers all those from the age of criminal responsibility to the eve of their eighteenth birthday. Much flexibility in the calculation of the minimum term is needed on that account alone, as well as to reflect the individual circumstances of the offence. Put shortly, were two children together convicted of murder, one aged 12 and the other aged 17, it would be wrong to suppose that the age-related reduction was entirely reflected in the statutory provisions. Schedule 21 also contains a non-exhaustive list of aggravating and mitigating factors. Importantly, however, the features of a murder that would lead to an enhanced starting point for an adult act as significant aggravating factors when sentencing someone under 18. Taking a knife to the scene of a murder is such an aggravating factor - and a seriously aggravating factor. So much has been confirmed repeatedly by this court: for example, see R v M, AM and Kika [2010] 2 Cr App R(S) 19 at [3] and [4]; R v James Moore [2011] Cr App R(S) 94 at [24] and [25]; and R v Odegbune [2013] EWCA Crim 711 at [35]. Mr Glasgow QC, who appears today on behalf of the prosecution, as he did at the trial, recognises that the judge's approach to the applicability of the guideline relating to children and young people displayed an error. Whilst the judge recognised that youth and maturity were material factors, he did not consider the guideline in any detail, and in particular paragraph 4.10. The approach to that guideline in the context of murder was considered in this court in R v DM [2019] EWCA Crim 1354 , a decision which postdates the sentencing in this case. In giving the judgment of the court, at [28] Holroyde LJ said: ""The Sentencing Council has published a Definitive Guideline which sets out Overarching Principles for Sentencing Children and Young People. Because the sentence for murder is fixed by law, the nature of the sentence is not affected by considerations of the welfare of the offender, or of the principal aim of the youth justice system which is to reduce offending by children and young persons. It nonetheless remains important when considering the appropriate minimum term to consider the developmental and emotional age of the offender and to consider, in accordance with paragraph 4.10 of the guideline, whether the young offender has: 'the necessary maturity to appreciate fully the consequences of their conduct, the extent to which the child or young person has been acting on an impulsive basis and whether their conduct has been affected by inexperience, emotional volatility or negative influences.'"" As is well-known, starting points are no more than that. In arriving at the minimum term, whether for adults or for children, a careful assessment of all relevant features in a particular case can lead to a significant departure from the statutory starting point, both upwards and downwards. Discussion At the heart of the submissions advanced by Mr Bentley this morning is the proposition that in arriving at the minimum term of 21 years, the judge gave insufficient weight to the appellant's age (two and a half years younger than his nearest co-accused and nearly seven years younger than the oldest), and also to his background. We have summarised that by reference to the pre sentence report. In his written skeleton argument, Mr Glasgow drew our attention to the observation of Maurice Kay LJ in R v Taylor [2008] 1 Cr App R(S) 4 , to the effect that it was ""neither just nor logical"" to impose ""significantly divergent"" minimum terms for two offenders of equal culpability when they were either side of their eighteenth birthdays. That was a reference to what is sometimes described as the absence of a ""cliff edge"" in the approach to sentencing those either side of their eighteenth birthdays. This, however, is not such a case, as Mr Glasgow readily accepted in his oral submissions. In chronological terms and in terms of maturity there is a real different between a defendant who has just passed his sixteenth birthday and one who is just shy of his nineteenth birthday. The aggravating features identified by the judge in his sentencing remarks are unimpeachable, but we find ourselves in respectful disagreement with the judge's conclusion that, despite the appellant's youth and background, the starting point should be as high as 21 years. The appellant was a good deal younger than the others. That is itself a factor which carries significant weight. Moreover, a striking feature of this case is the appellant's circumstances, which we have summarised. They led him to be a drug user at 11, an addict by 13, and by the same age a professional drug dealer. By then he had been swept up into gang violence. Violence had been a constant background of his life from a very early age. We would emphasise that a minimum term is just that. There is no automatic release from detention for those in the appellant's position. He will only be released if the Parole Board judges it safe to do so. Yet, this appellant was a child who was steeped in criminality whilst he was still of primary school age. He was only a little over 16 years when this dreadful murder was committed. We accept Mr Bentley's submission that these factors, when taken together, lead to the conclusion that the minimum term of 21 years is significantly longer than is appropriate. The use of a knife and the other aggravating features identified by the judge inevitably lead to the conclusion that the minimum term must be above the statutory starting point, despite the appellant's youth and circumstances. In our judgment, the appropriate minimum term, having regard to all material factors in this dreadful case, is one of 16 years, to which the time spent in custody on remand will count. In those circumstances, we allow this appeal and we substitute the minimum term of 16 years in the way we have described for that of 21 years.

He was almost 16 years and 3 months old when, just before 5pm on 2 nd June 2018, he and others murdered Tavis Spencer-Aitken (aged 17) in Ipswich in a gang-related revenge attack. Following a lengthy trial in the Crown Court at Ipswich before His Honour Judge Levett and a jury, the appellant and three others were convicted of murder and another of manslaughter. On 30 th April 2019, the appellant was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, with a minimum term of 21 years (less 327 days spent on remand in custody to count towards it). The appellant now appeals against sentence by limited leave of the single judge. On the appellant's behalf, Mr Bentley QC, for whose written and oral submissions we are grateful, submits: (i) That the increase to 21 years from the 12 year statutory starting point for a defendant aged 16 was far too great: (ii) The judge paid insufficient regard to the age of the appellant, and of its effect on his culpability; (iii) The judge paid insufficient regard to the personal circumstances of the appellant, as described in the pre-sentence report; (iv) The sentences for the three adult co-defendants demonstrate that the judge allowed insufficient disparity between their minimum terms and that imposed upon the appellant, given the different applicable statutory starting points. The co-accused nearest in age to the appellant was Isaac Calver, whose date of birth was 28 th September 1999. Thus, he was almost 19 at the time of the murder - two and a half years older than the appellant. He, too, received a minimum term of 21 years for the offence of murder. Aristote Yenge was aged 22 at the time of the murder. He received a minimum term of 25 years. Adbayo Amusa was almost 20 at the time of the offence. He received a minimum of 23 years. The Facts The appellant had been a member of a gang called ""J Block"" since he was only 13 years old. The deceased was associated with a rival gang called ""Neno"", or ""The Three"" (a reference to its postcode location within Ipswich). The facts underlying the murder are truly appalling. They illustrate the pernicious, destructive and evil influence of gang culture on young people. Earlier in the day of 2 nd June 2018, the appellant and Yenge had been in Ipswich town centre. They had been chased by two members of the Neno gang. They took refuge in a shop. An off-duty police officer intervened. Rather than leave the matter alone, they decided to exact some revenge. The appellant and Yenge went to a nearby house, where the appellant made contact by telephone with a range of members of J Block who then assembled in a nearby park. They drove to Nacton, the home territory in Ipswich of the Neno gang, armed with knives. Their purpose was to seek out a member of that gang to exact revenge. It appears that the deceased was the first member of that gang they saw. They set upon him in the street, close to his home. Between them, they stabbed him 15 times. He died shortly afterwards in hospital. This is a tragedy spoken to eloquently in the Victim Personal Statements we have read from the deceased's mother, his father and his grandmother. His sister cradled her dying brother in her arms on the pavement. The Sentencing Remarks The judge set out his reasoning for arriving at each of the sentences, and by setting them in the overall context of what had occurred, with meticulous clarity. His material conclusions so far as the appellant was concerned were these: (i) The appellant had been responsible for corralling the group which proceeded to kill the deceased. Despite his age, the appellant was influential in the gang. (ii) The attack was a premeditated, targeted revenge attack. (iii) The appellant - and indeed the others convicted of murder - had an intention to kill the deceased. (iv) The appellant and Yenge took the two knives used in the attack to the scene, but all knew that knives were there and to be used. (v) Overall, the appellant had a prominent, leading role in what occurred. (vi) The killing was the result of a long-standing hostility between the gangs. (vii) All the co-accused had taken care to turn off their telephones to avoid the possibility of their movements being traced. After the attack, they not only disposed of their weapons, but also washed their bodies and clothes in an attempt to eliminate forensic traces. In sentencing the appellant to a minimum term of 21 years, the judge took into account the appellant's disturbed background, to which we will return, but took the view that the Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline which sets out overarching principles for sentencing children and young people had no direct application to sentencing for murder. It may well be that he reached that conclusion as a result of a footnote at the beginning of the guideline, which reads: ""This section does not apply when imposing a mandatory life sentence, when imposing a statutory minimum custodial sentence, when imposing a detention for life under the dangerous offender provisions or when making certain orders under the Mental Health Act 1983"". He made it clear that the guideline had no application in the sense that the usual factors applicable in sentencing young people would not be in play. Nonetheless, he considered that youth and immaturity were relevant factors. However, that footnote is concerned only with the general approach to sentencing children and young people found in section one of the guideline. As part of the background information available to him, the judge noted that the appellant had been a professional Class A drug dealer since he was 13. The appellant had explained this in his evidence by way of background. The appellant had convictions for battery and threatening with an offensive weapon when he was aged 14 and threatening behaviour when he was 15. He had also been cautioned for battery. The judge's overall conclusion was that the age difference between the appellant and his co accused also convicted of murder was of much less importance than would at first sight appear. The Pre-Sentence Report The detailed pre-sentence report illuminated the path followed by this 16 year old appellant enroute to becoming a murderer. He lived with his mother, but spent much time, both as a young child and since, with his father who was not only a heavy drug user, but also a drug dealer. When he was with his father, he mixed in an environment which included many other people who both took hard drugs and dealt in hard drugs. From a very young age, such an environment was the appellant's normal way of life. In short, it is the environment into which he was born. He was also subject to, and witnessed, violence as a child. That, too, was normal for him from a very early age. By the time he was 11 years of age, he was a habitual cannabis user. By the age of 13, he was a user of and became addicted to liquid codeine. His early gang involvement arose at about the same age, as did his becoming a drug dealer. His involvement with the gang led to violent attacks on his mother's home, which precipitated more than one relocation. The appellant himself had been stabbed in a gang-related attack when he was aged 14. The General Approach to Sentencing in Murder Cases Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 applies to the determination of the minimum term. For adults (those 18 and over), the starting point for the minimum term is generally 15 years, but with a higher starting point in a range of circumstances. One of those circumstances is when a knife is used and taken to the scene of the murder. If that is established, the starting point for an adult is 25 years. The starting point applied by the judge in the cases of the three co accused convicted of murder was that enhanced starting point. By contrast, the starting point for offenders under the age of 18 is 12 years. There are no comparable higher starting points specified by the statute for young murderers who, if adults at the time of offending, would have been subject to enhanced minimum terms. The starting point for young offenders covers all those from the age of criminal responsibility to the eve of their eighteenth birthday. Much flexibility in the calculation of the minimum term is needed on that account alone, as well as to reflect the individual circumstances of the offence. Put shortly, were two children together convicted of murder, one aged 12 and the other aged 17, it would be wrong to suppose that the age-related reduction was entirely reflected in the statutory provisions. Schedule 21 also contains a non-exhaustive list of aggravating and mitigating factors. Importantly, however, the features of a murder that would lead to an enhanced starting point for an adult act as significant aggravating factors when sentencing someone under 18. Taking a knife to the scene of a murder is such an aggravating factor - and a seriously aggravating factor. So much has been confirmed repeatedly by this court: for example, see R v M, AM and Kika [2010] 2 Cr App R(S) 19 at [3] and [4]; R v James Moore [2011] Cr App R(S) 94 at [24] and [25]; and R v Odegbune [2013] EWCA Crim 711 at [35]. Mr Glasgow QC, who appears today on behalf of the prosecution, as he did at the trial, recognises that the judge's approach to the applicability of the guideline relating to children and young people displayed an error. Whilst the judge recognised that youth and maturity were material factors, he did not consider the guideline in any detail, and in particular paragraph 4.10. The approach to that guideline in the context of murder was considered in this court in R v DM [2019] EWCA Crim 1354 , a decision which postdates the sentencing in this case. In giving the judgment of the court, at [28] Holroyde LJ said: ""The Sentencing Council has published a Definitive Guideline which sets out Overarching Principles for Sentencing Children and Young People. Because the sentence for murder is fixed by law, the nature of the sentence is not affected by considerations of the welfare of the offender, or of the principal aim of the youth justice system which is to reduce offending by children and young persons. It nonetheless remains important when considering the appropriate minimum term to consider the developmental and emotional age of the offender and to consider, in accordance with paragraph 4.10 of the guideline, whether the young offender has: 'the necessary maturity to appreciate fully the consequences of their conduct, the extent to which the child or young person has been acting on an impulsive basis and whether their conduct has been affected by inexperience, emotional volatility or negative influences.'"" As is well-known, starting points are no more than that. In arriving at the minimum term, whether for adults or for children, a careful assessment of all relevant features in a particular case can lead to a significant departure from the statutory starting point, both upwards and downwards. Discussion At the heart of the submissions advanced by Mr Bentley this morning is the proposition that in arriving at the minimum term of 21 years, the judge gave insufficient weight to the appellant's age (two and a half years younger than his nearest co-accused and nearly seven years younger than the oldest), and also to his background. We have summarised that by reference to the pre sentence report. In his written skeleton argument, Mr Glasgow drew our attention to the observation of Maurice Kay LJ in R v Taylor [2008] 1 Cr App R(S) 4 , to the effect that it was ""neither just nor logical"" to impose ""significantly divergent"" minimum terms for two offenders of equal culpability when they were either side of their eighteenth birthdays. That was a reference to what is sometimes described as the absence of a ""cliff edge"" in the approach to sentencing those either side of their eighteenth birthdays. This, however, is not such a case, as Mr Glasgow readily accepted in his oral submissions. In chronological terms and in terms of maturity there is a real different between a defendant who has just passed his sixteenth birthday and one who is just shy of his nineteenth birthday. The aggravating features identified by the judge in his sentencing remarks are unimpeachable, but we find ourselves in respectful disagreement with the judge's conclusion that, despite the appellant's youth and background, the starting point should be as high as 21 years. The appellant was a good deal younger than the others. That is itself a factor which carries significant weight. Moreover, a striking feature of this case is the appellant's circumstances, which we have summarised. They led him to be a drug user at 11, an addict by 13, and by the same age a professional drug dealer. By then he had been swept up into gang violence. Violence had been a constant background of his life from a very early age. We would emphasise that a minimum term is just that. There is no automatic release from detention for those in the appellant's position. He will only be released if the Parole Board judges it safe to do so. Yet, this appellant was a child who was steeped in criminality whilst he was still of primary school age. He was only a little over 16 years when this dreadful murder was committed. We accept Mr Bentley's submission that these factors, when taken together, lead to the conclusion that the minimum term of 21 years is significantly longer than is appropriate. The use of a knife and the other aggravating features identified by the judge inevitably lead to the conclusion that the minimum term must be above the statutory starting point, despite the appellant's youth and circumstances. In our judgment, the appropriate minimum term, having regard to all material factors in this dreadful case, is one of 16 years, to which the time spent in custody on remand will count. In those circumstances, we allow this appeal and we substitute the minimum term of 16 years in the way we have described for that of 21 years."

APPEALS AGAINST CONVICTION In R v Reid , 62 Cr App R 109 at 112, Lawton LJ delivering the judgment of the Court said: ""When two or more men go out together in joint possession of offensive weapons such as revolvers and knives and the circumstances are such as to justify an inference that the very least they intend to do with them is to use them to cause fear in another, there is, in our judgment, always a likelihood that, in the excitement and tensions of the occasion, one of them will use the weapon in some way which will cause death or serious injury. If such injury was not intended by the others, they must be acquitted of murder; but having started out on an enterprise which envisaged some degree of violence, albeit nothing more than causing fright, they will be guilty of manslaughter."" It has been argued on behalf of the appellants in this case, with the support of the authors of Smith & Hogan Criminal Law, 7th edition, at page 146, that this statement of the law cannot stand with other decisions of the Court of Appeal and should not be regarded as good law. The appellants Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart stood their trial in the Crown Court at Manchester before Morland J and a jury. The indictment had originally charged three defendants, Wayne Lambert, Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart with the murder of Mr Dada. The second count had charged those three defendants with the robbery of money from Mr Dada. Before the trial Wayne Lambert pleaded guilty to both counts and Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart pleaded guilty to the robbery count. Accordingly Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart only stood trial upon the murder count. The jury acquitted them of murder but found them guilty of manslaughter. With the leave of the single judge they appeal against their convictions of manslaughter. On the evening of Thursday 23rd January 1992, Mr Dada, a 60 year old Pakistani, was in his shop, the Popular Delicatessen, in Wilmslow Road, Withington. During the early evening two young women, Dawn Rothwell and Heather Stewart, went into the shop. They bought some cigarettes. Whilst there, Heather Stewart noticed Mr Dada removing some money from the till and putting it into his pocket. After they had left the shop and were walking along the road they met Wayne Lambert who was known to Heather Stewart. He was driving a car and Barry Schofield was with him. Heather Stewart told them about what she had seen in the shop and suggested that they should rob Mr Dada of the cash which they had seen him put in his pocket. They agreed. The four of them then drove back to near the shop, where Wayne Lambert, Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart got out. Dawn Rothwell stayed in the car and did not take any further part. There was evidence that the trio took out of the car a scaffolding bar and a knife. Wayne Lambert put on a balaclava and a long coat. Whilst Barry Schofield kept watch outside, the other two went into the shop. On the evidence that the jury must have accepted, Wayne Lambert had the bar and Heather Stewart had the knife. The upshot was that Mr Dada was viciously beaten with the bar and seriously injured and a relatively small amount of cash was stolen from him. He died a few days later in hospital as a result of the injuries he had received; these included four skull fractures. The money taken from Mr Dada was less than £100 cash. After the incident the three ran off to the car where the money was divided up. Both Heather Stewart and Barry Schofield had answered questions at interview but only Heather Stewart gave evidence at the trial. Barry Schofield had admitted knowledge of the weapons with which Wayne Lambert and Heather Stewart were armed. Heather Stewart said she did not know but the jury must have disbelieved her. They both said that they had not contemplated that Mr Dada would be more than threatened. They did not know at that time that Wayne Lambert was a person who was deeply motivated by racial hatred or would be liable to use such excessive violence. The Judge summarised his character in this way in the summing up: ""Let us for a moment consider what you know about Wayne Lambert. You saw him produced in the dock, a tall powerfully built man; a man you may think with an evil, senseless, savage hatred for members of the Pakistani community; a man who in the commission of crime is quick to inflict terrible injuries on his victims; a domineering and threatening personality."" The case of the two defendants at the trial was therefore that they were not to be associated with the killing of Mr Dada by Wayne Lambert. They said it went far beyond anything that they had contemplated or that they had any reason to contemplate. His attack on Mr Dada was motivated not by the needs of the robbery but by vicious racial hatred and was so excessive that it did not form part of any joint enterprise upon which the three of them were engaged. They said that the jury should not be satisfied that they were parties to the unlawful killing of Mr Dada. In his summing up the Judge dealt with the issues in this way: ""There is no dispute that Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart were parties with Wayne Lambert in a joint criminal enterprise to rob Mr Dada in his shop. Let us consider the case of murder in relation to Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart separately as we must. Barry Schofield's case is that although he knew that Heather Stewart was armed with a kitchen knife and Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar, he was never agreeable to the use of either weapon to inflict any injury on Mr Dada. The knife and the piece of scaffolding bar were only to be used to frighten Mr Dada. You could only convict Barry Schofield of murder if you were sure that Barry Schofield's case was false and were sure that as a part of the joint criminal enterprise Barry Schofield was agreeable to Wayne Lambert striking Mr Dada with a piece of scaffolding bar with specific intention of either killing him or doing him really serious bodily injury. Heather Stewart's case is that she did not carry a knife. She did not know that Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar. She was never agreeable to the infliction by Wayne Lambert of any bodily injury upon Mr Dada and indeed was horrified when she saw him strike Mr Dada with a piece of scaffolding pole. She expected the robbery to be effected by Wayne Lambert holding Mr Dada whilst she extracted the money from his pocket. You can only convict Heather Stewart of murder if you were sure that Heather Stewart's case was false and were sure that as [a] part of the joint criminal enterprise Heather Stewart was agreeable to Wayne Lambert striking Mr Dada with the piece of scaffolding bar with the specific intention of either killing him or doing him really serious bodily harm. If you find murder unproved against either Schofield or Stewart or both of them, you must return a verdict of not guilty of murder and then consider whether manslaughter is proved against either or both of them. Let us consider the case of manslaughter in relation to [Barry] Schofield and Heather Stewart, again separately as you must. Manslaughter is committed if a person is unlawfully fatally injured by another who at the time of inflicting the fatal injuries appreciates that his victim may suffer some bodily injury, albeit not necessarily serious injury. Manslaughter is an alternative offence to murder and a lesser offence than murder. You could only convict Barry Schofield of manslaughter if you were sure that as part of the joint criminal enterprise he was agreeable to, or realised that, or if he had thought about it must have realised that Wayne, Lambert might, in the heat of the moment or in the excitement or tension of the occasion, strike Mr Dada with a piece of scaffolding bar and inflict some bodily injury on him. You could only convict Heather Stewart of manslaughter if you were sure that she was armed with a kitchen knife and she knew that Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar, and you were sure that as part of the joint criminal enterprise she was agreeable to or realised, or if she had thought about it must have realised, that Wayne Lambert might, in the heat of the moment or in the excitement or tension of the occasion, strike Mr Dada with the piece of scaffolding bar and inflict some bodily injury on him."" It is acknowledged that the summing up of the Judge was both balanced and fair. But it is submitted on behalf of both appellants that the direction on manslaughter was wrong in law. Before the jury retired the Judge gave them written directions which corresponded to the directions which I have read out. The primary ground of appeal of the appellants is: ""Having regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R.v. Anderson and Morris [1966] 2 QB 110 and notwithstanding the subsequent authority of R.v. Reid (1975) 62 Cr App R 109, it is not open to a jury which acquits a secondary party of murder to convict him of manslaughter in the alternative, where the principal is guilty of murder."" Mr Farrer QC who appeared for Barry Schofield and upon whom the main burden of arguing the appeals fell, summarised the point in this way in his skeleton argument: ""The choice for the jury is this: either (i) The possible infliction of serious injury was contemplated by P2; if so, then death resulted from the execution of the common design; P2 is guilty of murder, regardless of his intent or (ii) P2 contemplated the possible infliction of no more than moderate injury; if so, then death resulted from an act which went beyond the design to which P2 was a party. P2 has no criminal liability for that death, whether in murder or manslaughter."" There was an alternative ground of appeal that the direction on joint enterprise and manslaughter was inadequately specific on the question of causation; whether the killing was outside the scope of the joint enterprise to rob. The alternative ground does not require separate consideration. We are satisfied that the Judge's summing up, both as a whole and in the directly relevant passages, drew to the jury's attention the relevant issues and the evidence upon which the defendants relied. The judge stressed to the jury that, if they were to convict, they had to reject the cases of the respective defendants; they had to be satisfied, so far as Heather Stewart was concerned, that she was armed with the kitchen knife and knew that Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar and, as regards both of them, that as part of the joint criminal enterprise they were each agreeable to or realised or must have realised the relevant matters. There was no risk that the jury failed to understand that, in order to return any verdict of guilty, they had to be satisfied that what Wayne Lambert did was done in the course of the joint enterprise of robbery even though the Judge did not, as he might have, repeat that phrase in the concluding part of his direction. Accordingly we do not consider that there is any material criticism to be made of the summing up in this respect. Reverting to the main ground of appeal, which seems to have been only very lightly touched on, if at all, before the Judge, it is important in our judgment, before discussing the authorities, to refer to some of the basic considerations in this part of the law. We consider that they are very adequately set out in Archbold, particularly at paragraphs 19 23 and following. Manslaughter The constituents of manslaughter are conveniently stated in the head note in DPP v Newbury [1977] AC 500 : ""[The] accused was guilty of manslaughter if it was proved that he intentionally did an act which was unlawful and dangerous and that that act inadvertently caused death. ... It was unnecessary to prove that the accused knew that the act was unlawful or dangerous. The test was still the objective test, namely whether all sober and reasonable people would recognise that the act was dangerous and not whether the accused recognised its danger."" Thus the criminal act is the doing of the unlawful act which causes the death. The unlawful act must be one which, objectively assessed, is dangerous, that is to say, subjects the victim to at least the risk of some harm, albeit not serious harm. ( R.v. Church 49 Cr App R 206; Newbury at pages 509 and 510.) The mental element required is no more than an intention to commit the unlawful act. Joint enterprise The allegation that a defendant took part in the execution of a crime as a joint enterprise is not the same as an allegation that he aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of that crime. A person who is a mere aider or abettor etc is truly a secondary party to the commission of whatever crime it is that the principal has committed although he may be charged as a principal. If the principal has committed the crime of murder, the liability of the secondary party can only be a liability for aiding and abetting murder. In contrast, where the allegation is joint enterprise, the allegation is that one defendant participated in the criminal act of another. This is a different principle. It renders each of the parties to a joint enterprise criminally liable for the acts done in the course of carrying out that joint enterprise. Where the criminal liability of any given defendant depends upon the further proof that he had a certain state of mind, that state of mind must be proved against that defendant. Even though several defendants may, as a result of having engaged in a joint enterprise, be each criminally responsible for the criminal act of one of those defendants done in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise, their individual criminal responsibility will, in such a case, depend upon what individual state of mind or intention has been proved against them. Thus, each may be a party to the unlawful act which caused the victim's death. But one may have had the intent either to kill him or to cause him serious harm and be guilty of murder, whereas another may not have had that intent and may be guilty only of manslaughter. Mens rea An allegation that a defendant was part of a criminal joint enterprise with others includes an allegation that he was aware of the character of the joint enterprise in which he was joining and foresaw that the relevant criminal acts were liable to be involved. Thus, the allegation of joint enterprise involves an allegation concerning the state of the defendant's mind at the time of his participation in the joint enterprise. Normally the fact that the defendant had the state of mind sufficient to prove his guilt of the offence charged is proved by proof that he was a party to the joint enterprise in the course of which the criminal acts were committed. But joint enterprises vary. They may have a purpose, say the infliction of grievous bodily harm, which corresponds to the specific intent for a particular crime, say murder or an offence contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act, in which case participation in the joint enterprise will prove the relevant mens rea . But in other cases the purpose of the joint enterprise may have been more limited and the relevant criminal liability may only have arisen from some undesired consequence. Provided that the joint enterprise is proved in relation to the relevant acts then it is not an answer that consequences of those acts were unusual or unexpected. Even if unusual or unexpected consequences arose from the execution of the plan, each participant is responsible for those consequences. In such cases the liability of an individual defendant may depend upon whether his intention at the time the act was done included an intention that the consequence should follow. A defendant who had that intention may have a more serious criminal liability than one who did not. This is because the mens rea for the more serious offence can be proved against the one but not against the other. Archbold The analysis which we have shortly summarised is that followed by the editors of Archbold and by way of summary we are content to adopt what they say: ""A person who is a party to a joint enterprise, the pursuance of which results in the causing of another's death may be criminally liable for that death either on the basis that he is guilty of murder or on the basis that he is guilty of manslaughter. It is fundamental to a conviction of either offence that the accused must have been a party to the act which caused death. The application of the law concerning joint enterprise in cases of homicide in practice raises two problems, (i) whether in the circumstances the accused was party to the act which caused death; (ii) if he was, whether his state of mind was such as to make him guilty of murder or of manslaughter."" The editors go on to refer to the case of R.v. Richards and Stobber 96 Cr App R 258 in which it was recognised that different pleas might be accepted from defendants involved in a joint enterprise on this basis. The editors also treat the case of Reid and the case of Betty 48 Cr App R 6 (see paragraph 19 93) as exemplifying and confirming their analysis. The Authorities The main case upon which Mr Farrer founded his submissions was Anderson and Morris [1966] 2 QB 110, 50 Cr App R 216. But like him we will start with Betty (supra). Betty and another man were charged with manslaughter and both were convicted. The killing arose out of a fight in which they were both involved. Their defences at trial were self defence. But Betty also argued that in truth his co defendant had murdered the victim and that this meant that he, Betty, should not have been convicted of manslaughter. The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected that argument, saying that the point was covered by an earlier decision of a five judge court, Smith [1963] 1 WLR 1200, in which the Court had expressly approved the direction ""Anybody who is a party to an attack which results in an unlawful killing which results in death is a party to the killing. ... 'only he who intended that unlawful and grievous bodily harm should be done is guilty of murder. He who intended only that the victim should be unlawfully hit and hurt will be guilty of manslaughter if death results'."" The Court dismissed Betty's appeal. They applied Smith and held that the point raised was no defence unless the unlawful act which resulted in death was not done in the course of the joint enterprise. In Anderson and Morris the Court was again a five judge court. Two men had been involved in an attack on a man. One of the men, Anderson, stabbed him with a knife and killed him. The other man, Morris, said that he had not known that Anderson was going to use a knife. Anderson was convicted of murder and Morris of manslaughter. Morris' appeal was allowed because the trial judge had directed the jury that neither the fact that Morris had not known about the knife nor the fact that Anderson did an act outside the common design to which Morris was a party could provide Morris with a defence to manslaughter. This was a clear misdirection. The Court approved and adopted the submission of Mr Lane QC, counsel for Morris, that whilst a party to a joint enterprise would be liable for the acts done in pursuance of the joint enterprise, including ""liability for unusual consequences if they arise from the execution of the agreed joint enterprise; but ... if one of the adventurers goes beyond what has been tacitly agreed as part of the common enterprise, his co adventurer is not liable for the consequence of that unauthorised act"". (50 Cr App R at page 221.) The Court did not question Smith and Betty (by which they were anyway bound). What they did was to confirm and stress the need for the Crown, if it seeks to rely upon joint enterprise, to prove that the criminal act was done as part of the joint enterprise. There is nothing in this which is inconsistent with the directions of Morland J. In Lovesey and Peterson 53 Cr App R 461, following Anderson and Morris and applying the 'Lane' formulation, the Court refused to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for an unsatisfactory conviction for murder because they considered that the degree of violence used led to the conclusion that if the acts were within the common design it had to be murder and, if they were not, there was no other basis for any finding of guilt. Reid was decided in 1975. The Court included Lane LJ who had been involved in both the previously cited cases and must have had them fully in mind. Three men, alleged by the Crown to be supporters of the IRA, armed with weapons went to the house of an army officer at night. When he opened the door one of them shot him. Two were convicted of murder; the third, Reid, was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. His defence had been that he was not part of the joint venture but had gone along with them in order to see whether the other two were really IRA terrorists, which he did not believe they were. The judge had given the jury a direction on manslaughter based upon Church . The appeal of Reid was based upon the factual submission that on the evidence it must have been murder or nothing. The Court rejected that submission. They stressed the common possession of the weapons. They said: ""If men carrying offensive indeed deadly weapons go to a man's house in the early hours of the morning for no discernable lawful purpose, they must, in our judgment, intend to do him harm of some kind, and the very least kind of harm is causing fright by threats to use them."" Having cited Anderson and Morris , they asked: ""Was O'Connaill's deliberate firing of the revolver 'a mere unforeseen consequence' of the unlawful possession of offensive weapons? We adjudge it was."" There then followed the passage quoted at the outset of this judgment. They dismissed Reid 's appeal. It is not possible to suggest that this decision was in any way per incuriam . Unless it is inconsistent with other binding authority, it is binding upon us. Penfold 71 Cr App R 4 did not involve the use of weapons, but the Court held that the fact that one defendant used excessive violence during a robbery, killing the victim, did not preclude a conviction for manslaughter on the basis of joint enterprise. The Court strongly commented upon the need to proceed on the basis of realistic inferences as to what was to be contemplated by those involved in crimes of violence and not to be drawn into unrealistic theoretical distinctions. This echoed the language in Reid . Chan Wing Sui , 80 Cr App R 117 (JC), was concerned with a joint enterprise to commit armed robbery which then led to a murder. The test was what should be seen as a possible incident of the unlawful criminal exercise. The jury were entitled to form their own view whether the risk of (severe) injury to the victim was so remote that it could be disregarded: ""They were entitled to remember that disastrous violent action on the impulse of a moment of emergency is very apt to occur when intruders have weapons"" (page 124). This case was followed in Ward 85 Cr App R 71, but not in Smith [1988] Crim LR 617. A case upon which Mr Farrer has particularly relied, and which he says is inconsistent with Reid , is Dunbar [1988] Crim LR 693 (for which we also have a transcript). The victim was a prostitute. She was found dead in the bath in her flat. She had been garrotted with a metal bar. She had also received other injuries. The evidence was that she had been killed by two burglars; they were convicted of murder. The case of the Crown was that they had been recruited by Dunbar, another prostitute. The allegation against her was, therefore, not that she had participated in a joint enterprise, but that she was an accessory before the fact and had counselled or procured the commission of the crime. She denied any incitement to murder. She knew that a burglary was being planned and appreciated that some minor violence might be done to the victim in the course of the burglary; she knew nothing about the intention to use an iron bar and did not contemplate any serious violence. She was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. The Court of Appeal, applying Anderson and Morris and Lovesey and Peterson , considered that the verdict of the jury was only consistent with the conclusion by the jury that ""one or both of her co defendants must have gone beyond the scope of that design and used the extreme violence which was intended to cause grievous bodily harm or death"". The Court stressed that it was ""on the facts of this case"" that they had concluded that there were only two verdicts open to the jury, guilty or not guilty of murder. The Court also considered the summing up in her case to be defective because it did not sufficiently cover the law incorporated in the 'Lane' formulation. The transcript of the judgment of the Court of Appeal does not justify the conclusion that the law was being stated or applied in any different way from the earlier cases. Leaving on one side defective directions of law by the trial judges, the distinction between the outcome of Smith , Betty , and Reid on the one hand and Anderson and Morris , Lovesey and Peterson and Dunbar on the other is that a different view was taken of the facts of the cases and whether the act in question was, or was to be treated as being, within or without the scope of the joint enterprise. Dunbar is not authority for the proposition that the cases falling on the other side of the line were wrongly decided nor for the proposition that, in a suitable case, a jury cannot properly find one participant in a joint enterprise guilty of murder and another of manslaughter. We do not agree with the views to the contrary expressed in the notes in the Criminal Law Review and in Smith & Hogan; that discussion also does not seem to take account of the fact that Dunbar probably should not be categorised as a case of joint enterprise at all. The case of Hyde 92 Cr App R 131, a case of joint enterprise, however, illustrates and confirms that a joint enterprise to commit a non violent crime, burglary, may become more serious if one participant continues appreciating that another may kill or intentionally inflict serious injury; a conviction for murder on that basis was upheld. Finally, we should refer to the advice of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Lowry in Hui Chi Ming , [1992] 1 AC 34 , which involved a group attack on a man in the course of which one of the attackers used a piece of piping and the man was killed. The fatal blow was struck by a man who had been acquitted of murder at an earlier trial but convicted of manslaughter. At the appellant's trial the Crown's case was that it had, nevertheless, been a case of a joint enterprise to inflict serious harm or kill. The appellant was convicted of murder. The main discussion related to what common enterprise was necessary to prove the mens rea for murder; Hyde was followed. But for present purposes the interest in the case is that the trial judge had directed the jury: ""14. If on the other hand, you are satisfied that the [defendant] was present and that he shared an intention with his companions that the victim should be assaulted and caused some injury, but some injury less than some really serious bodily injury, then he would not be guilty of murder but would be guilty of manslaughter. 15. If you conclude that it was a reasonable possibility that the [defendant] though present did not share any intention with the others that the victim should in any way be assaulted, then he would be entitled to an acquittal."" These directions recognised that, although the victim may have been murdered by another participant in the joint venture, the appellant, although a participant in a joint venture with others, may have lacked the mens rea for murder but could still be guilty of manslaughter. They were implicitly approved by Lord Lowry (page 41). The authorities do not support the appellants' submission. There is no suggestion that Reid was wrongly decided nor that there is an inconsistency between what Lawton LJ there said and what was said in Anderson and Morris by Lord Parker CJ. The distinction between the various cases is that, as one would expect, in different factual situations there may be different verdicts open to a jury. The latest case, Hui Chi Ming , confirms again that it is possible that a person may be a party to a joint enterprise which leads to death and be guilty of manslaughter although the actual killer may be guilty of murder. Conclusion The directions given by Morland J in the present case disclose no error of law. The verdicts of manslaughter were properly open to the jury and were correctly left to them. It is possible to identify a number of confusions in the appellants' arguments and, it appears, in the academic comment. Cases of joint enterprise, properly so termed, should not be confused with cases of counselling or procuring. It may often be the case that the proof of a defendant's mens rea is sufficiently proved by proof of his participation in the joint enterprise; the cases cited emphasise this. But it does not follow that this will, or must, always be the case. It is possible that a defendant, whilst being a participant in a joint enterprise and responsible for the unintended consequences of acts done in the course of the carrying out that joint enterprise, may lack a specific intent possessed by another participant. In any given case the issue may arise what was the scope of the joint enterprise; depending upon what answer is given to that question, a further question may arise where a crime of specific intent is charged, what was the state of mind of the defendant. The mens rea of the defendant may be proved by either method, by proof of participation in a joint enterprise having the requisite character, or, where the joint enterprise proved does not have that character, by proof of a specific intent. Where proof of participation in the joint enterprise during the course of which the relevant act was done is considered to prove only the mens rea appropriate to a lesser offence, only the lesser crime will have been proved against that defendant, although the act in question may have involved the commission of a more serious crime by another against whom a specific intent can be proved. The question whether the relevant act was committed in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise in which the defendant was a participant is a question of fact not law. If the act was not so committed then the joint enterprise ceases to provide a basis for a finding of guilt against such a defendant. He ceases to be responsible for the act. This is the fundamental point illustrated by Anderson and Morris and Lovesey and Peterson . But it does not follow that a variation in the intent of some of the participants at the time the critical act is done precludes the act from having been done in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise as is illustrated by Betty and Reid . The appeals against conviction must accordingly be dismissed. APPEALS AGAINST SENTENCE Both Heather Stewart and Barry Schofield appeal with leave of the single judge against their sentences. Heather Stewart fell to be sentenced only on the robbery count, to which she had pleaded guilty, and the manslaughter count on which she was convicted by the jury. The sentences passed were respectively nine years' and twelve years' imprisonment concurrent. Her date of birth was 5th October 1970. Barry Schofield is younger. His date of birth was 8th September 1974. He was therefore 18 at the time he was sentenced in January 1993. For the offences of robbery (on his plea) and manslaughter (on the jury's verdict) he was sentenced to respectively eight years' and eleven years' detention in a young offender institution. He also fell to be sentenced for a further offence (to which he had pleaded) of assisting an offender for which he was sentenced to a consecutive period of two years' detention, making, in his case, a total of thirteen years' detention. The features of the robbery and the manslaughter have already been outlined. It was a relatively unplanned robbery by a group of three persons from the 60 year old owner of a small local shop. Weapons were used and one of the assailants wore a balaclava. The weapons were potentially lethal, a metal bar and a knife, but were not firearms. During the course of the robbery the victim was severely beaten and received injuries from which he died. The sum of money taken was not large. The participation of Heather Stewart in the robbery was a major one. She was one of the instigators and she carried the knife. She did not however herself inflict violence on the victim. Barry Schofield was a willing participant in the robbery although he did not go into the shop. He knew that the other two were armed. It is accepted that neither Heather Stewart nor Barry Schofield wished the victim to be injured and had not known of the vicious racism of Wayne Lambert at the time they decided to rob the shop. Neither Heather Stewart nor Barry Schofield were of previous good character. She had committed a whole series of shoplifting offences over a number of years but had always been dealt with by way of a probation order or fine. At the time of the instant offences she was on probation for four offences of shoplifting and one of burglary. She had a drug habit. She had a previous conviction for possession of cannabis and spent the money obtained from the robbery on heroin. She had no personal mitigation beyond her plea to the robbery. She had a young child. It was accepted that her remorse for being involved in the killing of Mr Dada was genuine. Barry Schofield, given his age, had a bad record which included burglary and, in February 1992, a conviction for an offence of affray which involved a large serrated kitchen knife for which he received a short custodial sentence. He too was a user of hard drugs. At the time of committing the offence he was the subject of a probation order. He had no personal mitigation other than his limited pleas and his age. The judge thought it appropriate to have a one year differential between the sentences passed on these two defendants, having regard to the lesser involvement of Barry Schofield. No criticism is made of this. Both appellants submit that the sentences are too high since, as is accepted, the killing was the work of Wayne Lambert and he has received the appropriate sentence for murder. But the sentences passed, after a trial, for manslaughter committed in the course of an armed robbery are in line with authority and, whilst on the high side, cannot be said to be such that this Court should interfere. The sentences passed on the participants other than Wayne Lambert needed to, and did, reflect the much lower level of their guilt. We also have had regard to the totality of the sentences, taking into account their ages. But taking into account all those factors we consider that the sentences were appropriate. The other offence for which Barry Schofield fell to be sentenced was also serious. After the killing of Mr Dada Barry Schofield can have been under no illusions about the character of Wayne Lambert. Three days later, Wayne Lambert together with one Dean Millington committed a further robbery and murder. The victim was Mr Ansari, a coloured taxi driver. After this crime had been committed, Barry Schofield, knowing what had happened, assisted Wayne Lambert and Millington to cover their tracks by washing the victim's blood off the weapons used and helping to dispose of Millington's clothing. The consecutive sentence was not wrong and the only point which could be raised was one of totality. However, for the serious further offence which this young man committed we consider that the consecutive sentence of two years should stand. Accordingly, the appeals against sentence will be dismissed. MR FARRER: My Lords, may I say that whilst I appear as originally with my learned friend Mr McDermott for Schofield today, he appears on behalf of Miss Stewart. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Yes. MR FARRER: The Crown is represented by my learned friend Mr Hutchings. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Yes. MR FARRER: My Lords, in the light of your Lordships' decision on the appeal against conviction we apply, certainly on behalf of Schofield, for this Court to certify a point which I have drafted; indeed, I must apologise for the fact that this has been drafted in the alternative this being because I wanted to communicate originally with my learned junior as to his own view as to which was the more appropriate formulation. Could I ask you to ignore paradoxically the briefer formulation which appears in bold type at the top of this document and simply to look at the alternative formulation which follows. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: We will have to consider this. I think that is probably the best course, particularly in view of the hour. The appropriate course would be that we should consider together what formulation we consider would be appropriate and communicate our decision, if we are prepared to certify, to counsel. MR FARRER: I am grateful, my Lord. If I may anticipate; if your Lordships do think it right to certify then normally I would at least go through what is nowadays the formality of asking leave of the Court to Appeal. I am not quite clear whether your Lordships are implying that a more informal method of communication of your Lordships' decision LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: There are two questions; one is a certification MR FARRER: Yes. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: and the other is leave to appeal. As you rightly recognised, the practice now has developed, save in exceptional cases, to leave it to their Lordships' House to decide whether leave should be given, and I gather that you accept that. MR FARRER: Absolutely. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: That applies to this case as well. So if we do certify, you may take it that we will formally refuse leave so that you can make your application to the House of Lords. MR FARRER: I had simply in mind that plainly I am not anxious to increase the number of hearings certainly at which counsel attend or at which costs may be involved. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: About the question of certification, we have not discussed this among ourselves, but no doubt we have personal thoughts about it, although it is probable that we will be prepared to certify. We have your formulation, which of course we are at liberty to amend if we think something is better. MR FARRER: My Lord, yes. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: What is the position of the Crown on this? Have you had an opportunity in advance to see this formulation? MR HUTCHINGS: My Lord, no. (Same handed.) I see it now. I have no objection to my learned friend's question or the way he formulates it. I have nothing really to add. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: So you do not have any submissions. But if on consideration you do have any submissions to make, if you could incorporate them in a written document then we will take them into account in deciding what question we will certify. MR FARRER: I do not want to appear to be discourteous to the Crown but in fact there was consultation between defence and my learned friend Mr Tattersall who led for the Crown. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: That is excellent. MR JUSTICE TURNER: And the results of that consultation are reflected in this? MR FARRER: It has not been amended by the Crown, if I put it that way, and it may not be the Crown's choice. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Part of the trouble is that you have to formulate the question before you have seen the judgment. MR FARRER: Plainly, my Lords, and plainly before we had begun to appraise the significance of your Lordships' judgment. I appreciate that disadvantage as well. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Thank you. I thank counsel for their assistance. Mr McDermott, do you want to add anything? MR MCDERMOTT: My Lords, I was simply going to say that I also make that application on behalf of Stewart, whose interests I am representing this morning in addition to Schofield's. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: And you would accept that the basis of the applications must stand together? MR MCDERMOTT: My Lord, yes. [Appeals against conviction and sentence dismissed. The Court certified a point of law of general public importance but refused leave to appeal against conviction to the House of Lords.] The point of law certified by the Court was in the following terms: ""Where participant, 'A', in a criminal joint enterprise contemplates that the carrying out of the joint enterprise may involve the victim suffering some bodily injury, but not a serious injury, and 'B', another participant in that joint enterprise, forms, independently of the others, and intention to kill or do serious bodily harm to the victim and, with that intention, 'B' does an act which causes the death of the victim: Are the jury precluded, as a matter of law, from finding as a fact that that act was done in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise and convicting 'A' of manslaughter?"" © Crown Copyright BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1994/3.html","Stewart & Anor, R v [1994] EWCA Crim 3 (10 November 1994) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] 3 All ER 159, [1995] 1 Cr App R 441, [1995] 1 Cr App Rep 441 JISCBAILII_CASE_CRIME BAILII Citation Number: [1994] EWCA Crim 3 No: 93.0930/X3 (Stewart, 93/0931/X3 (Schofield) IN THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE THE COURT OF APPEAL (CRIMINAL DIVISION) B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE MR JUSTICE TURNER and MR JUSTICE WRIGHT ____________________ R E G I N A v HEATHER STEWART BARRY JOHN SCHOFIELD (Computer Aided Transcript of the Stenograph Notes of John Larking, Chancery House, Chancery Lane, London WC2 Telephone No: 071 404 7464 to the Court) ____________________ MR H.

APPEALS AGAINST CONVICTION In R v Reid , 62 Cr App R 109 at 112, Lawton LJ delivering the judgment of the Court said: ""When two or more men go out together in joint possession of offensive weapons such as revolvers and knives and the circumstances are such as to justify an inference that the very least they intend to do with them is to use them to cause fear in another, there is, in our judgment, always a likelihood that, in the excitement and tensions of the occasion, one of them will use the weapon in some way which will cause death or serious injury. If such injury was not intended by the others, they must be acquitted of murder; but having started out on an enterprise which envisaged some degree of violence, albeit nothing more than causing fright, they will be guilty of manslaughter."" It has been argued on behalf of the appellants in this case, with the support of the authors of Smith & Hogan Criminal Law, 7th edition, at page 146, that this statement of the law cannot stand with other decisions of the Court of Appeal and should not be regarded as good law. The appellants Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart stood their trial in the Crown Court at Manchester before Morland J and a jury. The indictment had originally charged three defendants, Wayne Lambert, Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart with the murder of Mr Dada. The second count had charged those three defendants with the robbery of money from Mr Dada. Before the trial Wayne Lambert pleaded guilty to both counts and Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart pleaded guilty to the robbery count. Accordingly Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart only stood trial upon the murder count. The jury acquitted them of murder but found them guilty of manslaughter. With the leave of the single judge they appeal against their convictions of manslaughter. On the evening of Thursday 23rd January 1992, Mr Dada, a 60 year old Pakistani, was in his shop, the Popular Delicatessen, in Wilmslow Road, Withington. During the early evening two young women, Dawn Rothwell and Heather Stewart, went into the shop. They bought some cigarettes. Whilst there, Heather Stewart noticed Mr Dada removing some money from the till and putting it into his pocket. After they had left the shop and were walking along the road they met Wayne Lambert who was known to Heather Stewart. He was driving a car and Barry Schofield was with him. Heather Stewart told them about what she had seen in the shop and suggested that they should rob Mr Dada of the cash which they had seen him put in his pocket. They agreed. The four of them then drove back to near the shop, where Wayne Lambert, Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart got out. Dawn Rothwell stayed in the car and did not take any further part. There was evidence that the trio took out of the car a scaffolding bar and a knife. Wayne Lambert put on a balaclava and a long coat. Whilst Barry Schofield kept watch outside, the other two went into the shop. On the evidence that the jury must have accepted, Wayne Lambert had the bar and Heather Stewart had the knife. The upshot was that Mr Dada was viciously beaten with the bar and seriously injured and a relatively small amount of cash was stolen from him. He died a few days later in hospital as a result of the injuries he had received; these included four skull fractures. The money taken from Mr Dada was less than £100 cash. After the incident the three ran off to the car where the money was divided up. Both Heather Stewart and Barry Schofield had answered questions at interview but only Heather Stewart gave evidence at the trial. Barry Schofield had admitted knowledge of the weapons with which Wayne Lambert and Heather Stewart were armed. Heather Stewart said she did not know but the jury must have disbelieved her. They both said that they had not contemplated that Mr Dada would be more than threatened. They did not know at that time that Wayne Lambert was a person who was deeply motivated by racial hatred or would be liable to use such excessive violence. The Judge summarised his character in this way in the summing up: ""Let us for a moment consider what you know about Wayne Lambert. You saw him produced in the dock, a tall powerfully built man; a man you may think with an evil, senseless, savage hatred for members of the Pakistani community; a man who in the commission of crime is quick to inflict terrible injuries on his victims; a domineering and threatening personality."" The case of the two defendants at the trial was therefore that they were not to be associated with the killing of Mr Dada by Wayne Lambert. They said it went far beyond anything that they had contemplated or that they had any reason to contemplate. His attack on Mr Dada was motivated not by the needs of the robbery but by vicious racial hatred and was so excessive that it did not form part of any joint enterprise upon which the three of them were engaged. They said that the jury should not be satisfied that they were parties to the unlawful killing of Mr Dada. In his summing up the Judge dealt with the issues in this way: ""There is no dispute that Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart were parties with Wayne Lambert in a joint criminal enterprise to rob Mr Dada in his shop. Let us consider the case of murder in relation to Barry Schofield and Heather Stewart separately as we must. Barry Schofield's case is that although he knew that Heather Stewart was armed with a kitchen knife and Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar, he was never agreeable to the use of either weapon to inflict any injury on Mr Dada. The knife and the piece of scaffolding bar were only to be used to frighten Mr Dada. You could only convict Barry Schofield of murder if you were sure that Barry Schofield's case was false and were sure that as a part of the joint criminal enterprise Barry Schofield was agreeable to Wayne Lambert striking Mr Dada with a piece of scaffolding bar with specific intention of either killing him or doing him really serious bodily injury. Heather Stewart's case is that she did not carry a knife. She did not know that Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar. She was never agreeable to the infliction by Wayne Lambert of any bodily injury upon Mr Dada and indeed was horrified when she saw him strike Mr Dada with a piece of scaffolding pole. She expected the robbery to be effected by Wayne Lambert holding Mr Dada whilst she extracted the money from his pocket. You can only convict Heather Stewart of murder if you were sure that Heather Stewart's case was false and were sure that as part of the joint criminal enterprise Heather Stewart was agreeable to Wayne Lambert striking Mr Dada with the piece of scaffolding bar with the specific intention of either killing him or doing him really serious bodily harm. If you find murder unproved against either Schofield or Stewart or both of them, you must return a verdict of not guilty of murder and then consider whether manslaughter is proved against either or both of them. Let us consider the case of manslaughter in relation to Schofield and Heather Stewart, again separately as you must. Manslaughter is committed if a person is unlawfully fatally injured by another who at the time of inflicting the fatal injuries appreciates that his victim may suffer some bodily injury, albeit not necessarily serious injury. Manslaughter is an alternative offence to murder and a lesser offence than murder. You could only convict Barry Schofield of manslaughter if you were sure that as part of the joint criminal enterprise he was agreeable to, or realised that, or if he had thought about it must have realised that Wayne, Lambert might, in the heat of the moment or in the excitement or tension of the occasion, strike Mr Dada with a piece of scaffolding bar and inflict some bodily injury on him. You could only convict Heather Stewart of manslaughter if you were sure that she was armed with a kitchen knife and she knew that Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar, and you were sure that as part of the joint criminal enterprise she was agreeable to or realised, or if she had thought about it must have realised, that Wayne Lambert might, in the heat of the moment or in the excitement or tension of the occasion, strike Mr Dada with the piece of scaffolding bar and inflict some bodily injury on him."" It is acknowledged that the summing up of the Judge was both balanced and fair. But it is submitted on behalf of both appellants that the direction on manslaughter was wrong in law. Before the jury retired the Judge gave them written directions which corresponded to the directions which I have read out. The primary ground of appeal of the appellants is: ""Having regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R.v. Anderson and Morris [1966] 2 QB 110 and notwithstanding the subsequent authority of R.v. Reid (1975) 62 Cr App R 109, it is not open to a jury which acquits a secondary party of murder to convict him of manslaughter in the alternative, where the principal is guilty of murder."" Mr Farrer QC who appeared for Barry Schofield and upon whom the main burden of arguing the appeals fell, summarised the point in this way in his skeleton argument: ""The choice for the jury is this: either (i) The possible infliction of serious injury was contemplated by P2; if so, then death resulted from the execution of the common design; P2 is guilty of murder, regardless of his intent or (ii) P2 contemplated the possible infliction of no more than moderate injury; if so, then death resulted from an act which went beyond the design to which P2 was a party. P2 has no criminal liability for that death, whether in murder or manslaughter."" There was an alternative ground of appeal that the direction on joint enterprise and manslaughter was inadequately specific on the question of causation; whether the killing was outside the scope of the joint enterprise to rob. The alternative ground does not require separate consideration. We are satisfied that the Judge's summing up, both as a whole and in the directly relevant passages, drew to the jury's attention the relevant issues and the evidence upon which the defendants relied. The judge stressed to the jury that, if they were to convict, they had to reject the cases of the respective defendants; they had to be satisfied, so far as Heather Stewart was concerned, that she was armed with the kitchen knife and knew that Wayne Lambert was armed with a piece of scaffolding bar and, as regards both of them, that as part of the joint criminal enterprise they were each agreeable to or realised or must have realised the relevant matters. There was no risk that the jury failed to understand that, in order to return any verdict of guilty, they had to be satisfied that what Wayne Lambert did was done in the course of the joint enterprise of robbery even though the Judge did not, as he might have, repeat that phrase in the concluding part of his direction. Accordingly we do not consider that there is any material criticism to be made of the summing up in this respect. Reverting to the main ground of appeal, which seems to have been only very lightly touched on, if at all, before the Judge, it is important in our judgment, before discussing the authorities, to refer to some of the basic considerations in this part of the law. We consider that they are very adequately set out in Archbold, particularly at paragraphs 19 23 and following. Manslaughter The constituents of manslaughter are conveniently stated in the head note in DPP v Newbury [1977] AC 500 : "" accused was guilty of manslaughter if it was proved that he intentionally did an act which was unlawful and dangerous and that that act inadvertently caused death. ... It was unnecessary to prove that the accused knew that the act was unlawful or dangerous. The test was still the objective test, namely whether all sober and reasonable people would recognise that the act was dangerous and not whether the accused recognised its danger."" Thus the criminal act is the doing of the unlawful act which causes the death. The unlawful act must be one which, objectively assessed, is dangerous, that is to say, subjects the victim to at least the risk of some harm, albeit not serious harm. ( R.v. Church 49 Cr App R 206; Newbury at pages 509 and 510.) The mental element required is no more than an intention to commit the unlawful act. Joint enterprise The allegation that a defendant took part in the execution of a crime as a joint enterprise is not the same as an allegation that he aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of that crime. A person who is a mere aider or abettor etc is truly a secondary party to the commission of whatever crime it is that the principal has committed although he may be charged as a principal. If the principal has committed the crime of murder, the liability of the secondary party can only be a liability for aiding and abetting murder. In contrast, where the allegation is joint enterprise, the allegation is that one defendant participated in the criminal act of another. This is a different principle. It renders each of the parties to a joint enterprise criminally liable for the acts done in the course of carrying out that joint enterprise. Where the criminal liability of any given defendant depends upon the further proof that he had a certain state of mind, that state of mind must be proved against that defendant. Even though several defendants may, as a result of having engaged in a joint enterprise, be each criminally responsible for the criminal act of one of those defendants done in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise, their individual criminal responsibility will, in such a case, depend upon what individual state of mind or intention has been proved against them. Thus, each may be a party to the unlawful act which caused the victim's death. But one may have had the intent either to kill him or to cause him serious harm and be guilty of murder, whereas another may not have had that intent and may be guilty only of manslaughter. Mens rea An allegation that a defendant was part of a criminal joint enterprise with others includes an allegation that he was aware of the character of the joint enterprise in which he was joining and foresaw that the relevant criminal acts were liable to be involved. Thus, the allegation of joint enterprise involves an allegation concerning the state of the defendant's mind at the time of his participation in the joint enterprise. Normally the fact that the defendant had the state of mind sufficient to prove his guilt of the offence charged is proved by proof that he was a party to the joint enterprise in the course of which the criminal acts were committed. But joint enterprises vary. They may have a purpose, say the infliction of grievous bodily harm, which corresponds to the specific intent for a particular crime, say murder or an offence contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act, in which case participation in the joint enterprise will prove the relevant mens rea . But in other cases the purpose of the joint enterprise may have been more limited and the relevant criminal liability may only have arisen from some undesired consequence. Provided that the joint enterprise is proved in relation to the relevant acts then it is not an answer that consequences of those acts were unusual or unexpected. Even if unusual or unexpected consequences arose from the execution of the plan, each participant is responsible for those consequences. In such cases the liability of an individual defendant may depend upon whether his intention at the time the act was done included an intention that the consequence should follow. A defendant who had that intention may have a more serious criminal liability than one who did not. This is because the mens rea for the more serious offence can be proved against the one but not against the other. Archbold The analysis which we have shortly summarised is that followed by the editors of Archbold and by way of summary we are content to adopt what they say: ""A person who is a party to a joint enterprise, the pursuance of which results in the causing of another's death may be criminally liable for that death either on the basis that he is guilty of murder or on the basis that he is guilty of manslaughter. It is fundamental to a conviction of either offence that the accused must have been a party to the act which caused death. The application of the law concerning joint enterprise in cases of homicide in practice raises two problems, (i) whether in the circumstances the accused was party to the act which caused death; (ii) if he was, whether his state of mind was such as to make him guilty of murder or of manslaughter."" The editors go on to refer to the case of R.v. Richards and Stobber 96 Cr App R 258 in which it was recognised that different pleas might be accepted from defendants involved in a joint enterprise on this basis. The editors also treat the case of Reid and the case of Betty 48 Cr App R 6 (see paragraph 19 93) as exemplifying and confirming their analysis. The Authorities The main case upon which Mr Farrer founded his submissions was Anderson and Morris [1966] 2 QB 110, 50 Cr App R 216. But like him we will start with Betty (supra). Betty and another man were charged with manslaughter and both were convicted. The killing arose out of a fight in which they were both involved. Their defences at trial were self defence. But Betty also argued that in truth his co defendant had murdered the victim and that this meant that he, Betty, should not have been convicted of manslaughter. The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected that argument, saying that the point was covered by an earlier decision of a five judge court, Smith [1963] 1 WLR 1200, in which the Court had expressly approved the direction ""Anybody who is a party to an attack which results in an unlawful killing which results in death is a party to the killing. ... 'only he who intended that unlawful and grievous bodily harm should be done is guilty of murder. He who intended only that the victim should be unlawfully hit and hurt will be guilty of manslaughter if death results'."" The Court dismissed Betty's appeal. They applied Smith and held that the point raised was no defence unless the unlawful act which resulted in death was not done in the course of the joint enterprise. In Anderson and Morris the Court was again a five judge court. Two men had been involved in an attack on a man. One of the men, Anderson, stabbed him with a knife and killed him. The other man, Morris, said that he had not known that Anderson was going to use a knife. Anderson was convicted of murder and Morris of manslaughter. Morris' appeal was allowed because the trial judge had directed the jury that neither the fact that Morris had not known about the knife nor the fact that Anderson did an act outside the common design to which Morris was a party could provide Morris with a defence to manslaughter. This was a clear misdirection. The Court approved and adopted the submission of Mr Lane QC, counsel for Morris, that whilst a party to a joint enterprise would be liable for the acts done in pursuance of the joint enterprise, including ""liability for unusual consequences if they arise from the execution of the agreed joint enterprise; but ... if one of the adventurers goes beyond what has been tacitly agreed as part of the common enterprise, his co adventurer is not liable for the consequence of that unauthorised act"". (50 Cr App R at page 221.) The Court did not question Smith and Betty (by which they were anyway bound). What they did was to confirm and stress the need for the Crown, if it seeks to rely upon joint enterprise, to prove that the criminal act was done as part of the joint enterprise. There is nothing in this which is inconsistent with the directions of Morland J. In Lovesey and Peterson 53 Cr App R 461, following Anderson and Morris and applying the 'Lane' formulation, the Court refused to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for an unsatisfactory conviction for murder because they considered that the degree of violence used led to the conclusion that if the acts were within the common design it had to be murder and, if they were not, there was no other basis for any finding of guilt. Reid was decided in 1975. The Court included Lane LJ who had been involved in both the previously cited cases and must have had them fully in mind. Three men, alleged by the Crown to be supporters of the IRA, armed with weapons went to the house of an army officer at night. When he opened the door one of them shot him. Two were convicted of murder; the third, Reid, was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. His defence had been that he was not part of the joint venture but had gone along with them in order to see whether the other two were really IRA terrorists, which he did not believe they were. The judge had given the jury a direction on manslaughter based upon Church . The appeal of Reid was based upon the factual submission that on the evidence it must have been murder or nothing. The Court rejected that submission. They stressed the common possession of the weapons. They said: ""If men carrying offensive indeed deadly weapons go to a man's house in the early hours of the morning for no discernable lawful purpose, they must, in our judgment, intend to do him harm of some kind, and the very least kind of harm is causing fright by threats to use them."" Having cited Anderson and Morris , they asked: ""Was O'Connaill's deliberate firing of the revolver 'a mere unforeseen consequence' of the unlawful possession of offensive weapons? We adjudge it was."" There then followed the passage quoted at the outset of this judgment. They dismissed Reid 's appeal. It is not possible to suggest that this decision was in any way per incuriam . Unless it is inconsistent with other binding authority, it is binding upon us. Penfold 71 Cr App R 4 did not involve the use of weapons, but the Court held that the fact that one defendant used excessive violence during a robbery, killing the victim, did not preclude a conviction for manslaughter on the basis of joint enterprise. The Court strongly commented upon the need to proceed on the basis of realistic inferences as to what was to be contemplated by those involved in crimes of violence and not to be drawn into unrealistic theoretical distinctions. This echoed the language in Reid . Chan Wing Sui , 80 Cr App R 117 (JC), was concerned with a joint enterprise to commit armed robbery which then led to a murder. The test was what should be seen as a possible incident of the unlawful criminal exercise. The jury were entitled to form their own view whether the risk of (severe) injury to the victim was so remote that it could be disregarded: ""They were entitled to remember that disastrous violent action on the impulse of a moment of emergency is very apt to occur when intruders have weapons"" (page 124). This case was followed in Ward 85 Cr App R 71, but not in Smith [1988] Crim LR 617. A case upon which Mr Farrer has particularly relied, and which he says is inconsistent with Reid , is Dunbar [1988] Crim LR 693 (for which we also have a transcript). The victim was a prostitute. She was found dead in the bath in her flat. She had been garrotted with a metal bar. She had also received other injuries. The evidence was that she had been killed by two burglars; they were convicted of murder. The case of the Crown was that they had been recruited by Dunbar, another prostitute. The allegation against her was, therefore, not that she had participated in a joint enterprise, but that she was an accessory before the fact and had counselled or procured the commission of the crime. She denied any incitement to murder. She knew that a burglary was being planned and appreciated that some minor violence might be done to the victim in the course of the burglary; she knew nothing about the intention to use an iron bar and did not contemplate any serious violence. She was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. The Court of Appeal, applying Anderson and Morris and Lovesey and Peterson , considered that the verdict of the jury was only consistent with the conclusion by the jury that ""one or both of her co defendants must have gone beyond the scope of that design and used the extreme violence which was intended to cause grievous bodily harm or death"". The Court stressed that it was ""on the facts of this case"" that they had concluded that there were only two verdicts open to the jury, guilty or not guilty of murder. The Court also considered the summing up in her case to be defective because it did not sufficiently cover the law incorporated in the 'Lane' formulation. The transcript of the judgment of the Court of Appeal does not justify the conclusion that the law was being stated or applied in any different way from the earlier cases. Leaving on one side defective directions of law by the trial judges, the distinction between the outcome of Smith , Betty , and Reid on the one hand and Anderson and Morris , Lovesey and Peterson and Dunbar on the other is that a different view was taken of the facts of the cases and whether the act in question was, or was to be treated as being, within or without the scope of the joint enterprise. Dunbar is not authority for the proposition that the cases falling on the other side of the line were wrongly decided nor for the proposition that, in a suitable case, a jury cannot properly find one participant in a joint enterprise guilty of murder and another of manslaughter. We do not agree with the views to the contrary expressed in the notes in the Criminal Law Review and in Smith & Hogan; that discussion also does not seem to take account of the fact that Dunbar probably should not be categorised as a case of joint enterprise at all. The case of Hyde 92 Cr App R 131, a case of joint enterprise, however, illustrates and confirms that a joint enterprise to commit a non violent crime, burglary, may become more serious if one participant continues appreciating that another may kill or intentionally inflict serious injury; a conviction for murder on that basis was upheld. Finally, we should refer to the advice of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Lowry in Hui Chi Ming , [1992] 1 AC 34 , which involved a group attack on a man in the course of which one of the attackers used a piece of piping and the man was killed. The fatal blow was struck by a man who had been acquitted of murder at an earlier trial but convicted of manslaughter. At the appellant's trial the Crown's case was that it had, nevertheless, been a case of a joint enterprise to inflict serious harm or kill. The appellant was convicted of murder. The main discussion related to what common enterprise was necessary to prove the mens rea for murder; Hyde was followed. But for present purposes the interest in the case is that the trial judge had directed the jury: ""14. If on the other hand, you are satisfied that the was present and that he shared an intention with his companions that the victim should be assaulted and caused some injury, but some injury less than some really serious bodily injury, then he would not be guilty of murder but would be guilty of manslaughter. 15. If you conclude that it was a reasonable possibility that the though present did not share any intention with the others that the victim should in any way be assaulted, then he would be entitled to an acquittal."" These directions recognised that, although the victim may have been murdered by another participant in the joint venture, the appellant, although a participant in a joint venture with others, may have lacked the mens rea for murder but could still be guilty of manslaughter. They were implicitly approved by Lord Lowry (page 41). The authorities do not support the appellants' submission. There is no suggestion that Reid was wrongly decided nor that there is an inconsistency between what Lawton LJ there said and what was said in Anderson and Morris by Lord Parker CJ. The distinction between the various cases is that, as one would expect, in different factual situations there may be different verdicts open to a jury. The latest case, Hui Chi Ming , confirms again that it is possible that a person may be a party to a joint enterprise which leads to death and be guilty of manslaughter although the actual killer may be guilty of murder. Conclusion The directions given by Morland J in the present case disclose no error of law. The verdicts of manslaughter were properly open to the jury and were correctly left to them. It is possible to identify a number of confusions in the appellants' arguments and, it appears, in the academic comment. Cases of joint enterprise, properly so termed, should not be confused with cases of counselling or procuring. It may often be the case that the proof of a defendant's mens rea is sufficiently proved by proof of his participation in the joint enterprise; the cases cited emphasise this. But it does not follow that this will, or must, always be the case. It is possible that a defendant, whilst being a participant in a joint enterprise and responsible for the unintended consequences of acts done in the course of the carrying out that joint enterprise, may lack a specific intent possessed by another participant. In any given case the issue may arise what was the scope of the joint enterprise; depending upon what answer is given to that question, a further question may arise where a crime of specific intent is charged, what was the state of mind of the defendant. The mens rea of the defendant may be proved by either method, by proof of participation in a joint enterprise having the requisite character, or, where the joint enterprise proved does not have that character, by proof of a specific intent. Where proof of participation in the joint enterprise during the course of which the relevant act was done is considered to prove only the mens rea appropriate to a lesser offence, only the lesser crime will have been proved against that defendant, although the act in question may have involved the commission of a more serious crime by another against whom a specific intent can be proved. The question whether the relevant act was committed in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise in which the defendant was a participant is a question of fact not law. If the act was not so committed then the joint enterprise ceases to provide a basis for a finding of guilt against such a defendant. He ceases to be responsible for the act. This is the fundamental point illustrated by Anderson and Morris and Lovesey and Peterson . But it does not follow that a variation in the intent of some of the participants at the time the critical act is done precludes the act from having been done in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise as is illustrated by Betty and Reid . The appeals against conviction must accordingly be dismissed. APPEALS AGAINST SENTENCE Both Heather Stewart and Barry Schofield appeal with leave of the single judge against their sentences. Heather Stewart fell to be sentenced only on the robbery count, to which she had pleaded guilty, and the manslaughter count on which she was convicted by the jury. The sentences passed were respectively nine years' and twelve years' imprisonment concurrent. Her date of birth was 5th October 1970. Barry Schofield is younger. His date of birth was 8th September 1974. He was therefore 18 at the time he was sentenced in January 1993. For the offences of robbery (on his plea) and manslaughter (on the jury's verdict) he was sentenced to respectively eight years' and eleven years' detention in a young offender institution. He also fell to be sentenced for a further offence (to which he had pleaded) of assisting an offender for which he was sentenced to a consecutive period of two years' detention, making, in his case, a total of thirteen years' detention. The features of the robbery and the manslaughter have already been outlined. It was a relatively unplanned robbery by a group of three persons from the 60 year old owner of a small local shop. Weapons were used and one of the assailants wore a balaclava. The weapons were potentially lethal, a metal bar and a knife, but were not firearms. During the course of the robbery the victim was severely beaten and received injuries from which he died. The sum of money taken was not large. The participation of Heather Stewart in the robbery was a major one. She was one of the instigators and she carried the knife. She did not however herself inflict violence on the victim. Barry Schofield was a willing participant in the robbery although he did not go into the shop. He knew that the other two were armed. It is accepted that neither Heather Stewart nor Barry Schofield wished the victim to be injured and had not known of the vicious racism of Wayne Lambert at the time they decided to rob the shop. Neither Heather Stewart nor Barry Schofield were of previous good character. She had committed a whole series of shoplifting offences over a number of years but had always been dealt with by way of a probation order or fine. At the time of the instant offences she was on probation for four offences of shoplifting and one of burglary. She had a drug habit. She had a previous conviction for possession of cannabis and spent the money obtained from the robbery on heroin. She had no personal mitigation beyond her plea to the robbery. She had a young child. It was accepted that her remorse for being involved in the killing of Mr Dada was genuine. Barry Schofield, given his age, had a bad record which included burglary and, in February 1992, a conviction for an offence of affray which involved a large serrated kitchen knife for which he received a short custodial sentence. He too was a user of hard drugs. At the time of committing the offence he was the subject of a probation order. He had no personal mitigation other than his limited pleas and his age. The judge thought it appropriate to have a one year differential between the sentences passed on these two defendants, having regard to the lesser involvement of Barry Schofield. No criticism is made of this. Both appellants submit that the sentences are too high since, as is accepted, the killing was the work of Wayne Lambert and he has received the appropriate sentence for murder. But the sentences passed, after a trial, for manslaughter committed in the course of an armed robbery are in line with authority and, whilst on the high side, cannot be said to be such that this Court should interfere. The sentences passed on the participants other than Wayne Lambert needed to, and did, reflect the much lower level of their guilt. We also have had regard to the totality of the sentences, taking into account their ages. But taking into account all those factors we consider that the sentences were appropriate. The other offence for which Barry Schofield fell to be sentenced was also serious. After the killing of Mr Dada Barry Schofield can have been under no illusions about the character of Wayne Lambert. Three days later, Wayne Lambert together with one Dean Millington committed a further robbery and murder. The victim was Mr Ansari, a coloured taxi driver. After this crime had been committed, Barry Schofield, knowing what had happened, assisted Wayne Lambert and Millington to cover their tracks by washing the victim's blood off the weapons used and helping to dispose of Millington's clothing. The consecutive sentence was not wrong and the only point which could be raised was one of totality. However, for the serious further offence which this young man committed we consider that the consecutive sentence of two years should stand. Accordingly, the appeals against sentence will be dismissed. MR FARRER: My Lords, may I say that whilst I appear as originally with my learned friend Mr McDermott for Schofield today, he appears on behalf of Miss Stewart. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Yes. MR FARRER: The Crown is represented by my learned friend Mr Hutchings. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Yes. MR FARRER: My Lords, in the light of your Lordships' decision on the appeal against conviction we apply, certainly on behalf of Schofield, for this Court to certify a point which I have drafted; indeed, I must apologise for the fact that this has been drafted in the alternative this being because I wanted to communicate originally with my learned junior as to his own view as to which was the more appropriate formulation. Could I ask you to ignore paradoxically the briefer formulation which appears in bold type at the top of this document and simply to look at the alternative formulation which follows. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: We will have to consider this. I think that is probably the best course, particularly in view of the hour. The appropriate course would be that we should consider together what formulation we consider would be appropriate and communicate our decision, if we are prepared to certify, to counsel. MR FARRER: I am grateful, my Lord. If I may anticipate; if your Lordships do think it right to certify then normally I would at least go through what is nowadays the formality of asking leave of the Court to Appeal. I am not quite clear whether your Lordships are implying that a more informal method of communication of your Lordships' decision LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: There are two questions; one is a certification MR FARRER: Yes. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: and the other is leave to appeal. As you rightly recognised, the practice now has developed, save in exceptional cases, to leave it to their Lordships' House to decide whether leave should be given, and I gather that you accept that. MR FARRER: Absolutely. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: That applies to this case as well. So if we do certify, you may take it that we will formally refuse leave so that you can make your application to the House of Lords. MR FARRER: I had simply in mind that plainly I am not anxious to increase the number of hearings certainly at which counsel attend or at which costs may be involved. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: About the question of certification, we have not discussed this among ourselves, but no doubt we have personal thoughts about it, although it is probable that we will be prepared to certify. We have your formulation, which of course we are at liberty to amend if we think something is better. MR FARRER: My Lord, yes. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: What is the position of the Crown on this? Have you had an opportunity in advance to see this formulation? MR HUTCHINGS: My Lord, no. (Same handed.) I see it now. I have no objection to my learned friend's question or the way he formulates it. I have nothing really to add. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: So you do not have any submissions. But if on consideration you do have any submissions to make, if you could incorporate them in a written document then we will take them into account in deciding what question we will certify. MR FARRER: I do not want to appear to be discourteous to the Crown but in fact there was consultation between defence and my learned friend Mr Tattersall who led for the Crown. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: That is excellent. MR JUSTICE TURNER: And the results of that consultation are reflected in this? MR FARRER: It has not been amended by the Crown, if I put it that way, and it may not be the Crown's choice. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Part of the trouble is that you have to formulate the question before you have seen the judgment. MR FARRER: Plainly, my Lords, and plainly before we had begun to appraise the significance of your Lordships' judgment. I appreciate that disadvantage as well. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: Thank you. I thank counsel for their assistance. Mr McDermott, do you want to add anything? MR MCDERMOTT: My Lords, I was simply going to say that I also make that application on behalf of Stewart, whose interests I am representing this morning in addition to Schofield's. LORD JUSTICE HOBHOUSE: And you would accept that the basis of the applications must stand together? MR MCDERMOTT: My Lord, yes. [Appeals against conviction and sentence dismissed. The Court certified a point of law of general public importance but refused leave to appeal against conviction to the House of Lords.] The point of law certified by the Court was in the following terms: ""Where participant, 'A', in a criminal joint enterprise contemplates that the carrying out of the joint enterprise may involve the victim suffering some bodily injury, but not a serious injury, and 'B', another participant in that joint enterprise, forms, independently of the others, and intention to kill or do serious bodily harm to the victim and, with that intention, 'B' does an act which causes the death of the victim: Are the jury precluded, as a matter of law, from finding as a fact that that act was done in the course of carrying out the joint enterprise and convicting 'A' of manslaughter?"" © Crown Copyright"

Just over 1 year later, on 7th September 2007, after a Newton hearing in which the judge determined that he had killed her for gain, to fund his cocaine habit, he was sentenced by His Honour Judge Forrester to the mandatory term of imprisonment for life. The judge specified 28 years as the minimum term to be served before he was considered for release by the Parole Board, less the 538 days which he had spent in custody on remand. His application for an extension of time of 1 year and 1 day within which to appeal against sentence was referred to the full court by the single judge. The facts are as follows. The applicant lived with his mother at 28 Harmood Street in Camden. At 8.30 am on 16th March 2006 he went to Kentish Town Police Station and reported that he had killed her. Police officers went to the house. In the rear bedroom they found her body, lying dressed only in her night clothes, on the floor, in a pool of blood. Nearby they found a bloodstained knife and a hammer which plainly were the murder weapons. In the living room they found the applicant's crack pipe on a table together with his mother's credit cards. There was evidence that she never willingly would have left out her credit cards because she knew from past experience that the applicant would have used them to obtain cocaine. The postmortem examination showed that she had suffered a compression of her neck and many blows to the head. She had four broken ribs. There were five puncture wounds to her right side, as if she had been poked with a knife tip. There were also marks on the neck caused by the blow. She had suffered in all over 40 blows in the course of this attack. Although the applicant purported to have little or no memory of the events leading up to her death, it seems that the evening before the applicant and his mother had gone out for a meal. Relations between them seemed then to be perfectly amicable. After the meal his mother had returned home and went to bed but the applicant went to a friend's house where he smoked crack cocaine. He returned home later and smoked more crack. In the early hours of the morning it is plain that he attacked his mother with the knife, the hammer and may be also a belt. Shortly after he killed her he took one of her credit cards. At 4.30 am he withdrew £200 from a cash machine and visited a local crack dealer from whom he bought more crack. He then went back home and smoked that. At some stage he must have tidied up a little. He put the murder weapons away. As we have already said, the following morning he went to the police station to report what he had done. There was a pre-sentence report in which the applicant maintained that he could not remember the actual killing but he said that he had experienced a visual and auditory hallucination on the evening of the killing. He said he heard voices as far as back as when he had been in his twenties and the voices instructed him to harm people. The applicant said he believed that his mother had dominated him and he gave the impression that he had not accepted full responsibility. He denied that he had acted as he had done in order to obtain money. The applicant started using cannabis at the age of 18 and at 32 he was introduced to crack. He described his relationship with his mother as close but he said that she was a forceful character. He claimed he had had mental health problems since he was in his early twenties. He said the hallucinations became worse when he smoked crack and drug use made him aggressive. There was a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Johns who was retained by the defence. He thought that the applicant presented with apparent signs of severe mental illness. He said he heard voices commanding him to harm himself and others but for various reasons the doctor did not regard the applicant as a reliable informant. Some of the elements in his medical history suggested a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. But the doctor thought that was unlikely. He thought these symptoms were probably due to malingering. However, although the applicant himself said that his misuse of cocaine had not led to aggression, the doctor thought that it was probable that his consumption of crack could lead to a psychotic state, such as a drug induced psychosis. It was his opinion, therefore, that the attack on his mother could have resulted just from anger or range, but he thought it more probable that it was due to an acute cocaine induced psychosis. The psychiatric report from Dr Chesterman, retained by the prosecution, said that the applicant had become preoccupied with obtaining crack cocaine. He claimed that he had heard voices even in childhood but the apparent psychotic symptoms which he described were not typical of genuine serious mental illness. Indeed he thought that the symptoms complained of were not genuine. He did not accept Dr Johns' conclusion that the applicant was suffering from cocaine-induced psychosis. The doctor noticed that there was evidence in the past that he had stolen from his mother in order to fund his cocaine habit. Whilst recognising that this was a matter for the court, he thought that the applicant had murdered his mother to obtain money to buy more crack cocaine. Dr Johns had been asked to comment on this report, which he did by way of addendum dated 16th October 2006. He reiterated that the applicant did not show signs of severe mental illness. He had fabricated symptoms to provide a partial explanation for his actions but Dr Johns thought it improbable that he had attacked his mother to gain the money to buy cocaine. He maintained his original opinion that a cocaine induced psychosis was the most probable explanation for the killing. The question therefore arose whether this was a murder for gain, with an appropriate starting point of 30 years, which was disputed by the defence. Quite rightly, the judge held a Newton hearing to determine that issue. The judge heard the psychiatric evidence. In the course of the careful judgment he reviewed all the circumstances of the case, he expressed his conclusion in these terms: ""Cocaine is the root cause here, and, under the influence of cocaine, I am sure, to the criminal standard of proof, that what happened on this night is that he wanted more cocaine. Of course, cocaine costs money, and he decided to use his mother's card for the purpose of getting money from a machine. His mother must have disapproved of that and resisted; but the defendant decided that she was not going to stand in his way, and therefore he attacked her. He used extreme violence, as can happen under the influence of intoxication or, I stress, withdrawal from this drug. He attacked her and, having killed her, used one of her cards to withdraw money from her account and purchase more cocaine for herself. In that sense, I have no doubt that this was a murder done for gain, within the meaning of paragraph 5(2)(c) of schedule 21."" In our judgment, there was plainly sufficient evidence to justify the judge coming to that conclusion and accordingly we reject the submission that the judge was wrong to take a starting point of 30 years. The judge then went on to decide what, if any, adjustment he should make to that starting point. Having regard to the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted by this man on his own mother, he considered this to be an horrific case. The applicant had been affected by cocaine but he said that was no excuse. Indeed it was, as he put it, an aggravating feature. The applicant may have no previous convictions but the judge said he had consistently broken the law by using Class A drugs. He had handed himself in to the police and he was given some credit for his plea of guilty but that credit was reduced because the Newton hearing had been determined against him. Accordingly, he fixed a minimum term at 28 years. It is now said that the minimum sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, particularly having regard to his early guilty plea. This court has repeatedly drawn attention to the dangers of applying starting points mechanistically. Full regard must be had to the detailed circumstances of each particular case, then to make such adjustments as are necessary to achieve justice in that particular case. The relevant circumstances are these. First, this was a most brutal murder. The attack being pressed home with ruthlessness and determination. Secondly it is, in our judgment, plainly an aggravating circumstance that the victim was his own mother, since this has greatly increased the anguish of the other members of the family. It is clear from their victim personal statements that they now must bear the knowledge not only that their mother has been brutally murdered but that the deed has been done by their own brother. Thirdly, as the judge decided, this was a murder for gain. However, there are degrees of seriousness, even in murders committed for gain. We do not think that this murder, dreadful though it is, is to be equated with murders committed in the course of robbery, particularly in the course of armed robberies when the murder is by shooting, and perhaps not even with murders committed in the course of a brutal burglary. Fourthly, there is the guilty plea. It is true that the applicant did not accept that this was a murder done for gain and that a Newton hearing therefore had to be held and it was decided against him. No doubt the judge was quite right to make some reduction to the credit for the guilty plea to which he was otherwise entitled. However, he did plead guilty and, of course, he did go to the police to confess his guilt, even before the investigation was underway. We think this feature was not perhaps given sufficient weight. For all these reasons we think that the minimum term of 28 years was somewhat too high. Accordingly, we extend time for the appeal. We grant leave to appeal. We reduce the minimum term to 23 years less the 538 days which he has spent in custody before sentence. We are anxious that this is not misunderstood or misreported. The defendant is not sentenced to 23 years but the sentence is and remains a sentence of life imprisonment but we order that 23 years should pass before his case is considered for release by the Parole Board. Whether or not he will then be safe to be released is, of course, a matter for them. MR HORNE: Your Lordships I am very grateful. May I confirm whether the order granted by Langstaff J is sufficient for today's hearing? LORD JUSTICE MOSES: The position is that permission to appeal has been granted. He is here, and we have dealt with that application as the appeal. Are you worried about a representation order? Now I have understood. You may have a certificate of representation for today's hearing. MR HORNE: I am very grateful.

Just over 1 year later, on 7th September 2007, after a Newton hearing in which the judge determined that he had killed her for gain, to fund his cocaine habit, he was sentenced by His Honour Judge Forrester to the mandatory term of imprisonment for life. The judge specified 28 years as the minimum term to be served before he was considered for release by the Parole Board, less the 538 days which he had spent in custody on remand. His application for an extension of time of 1 year and 1 day within which to appeal against sentence was referred to the full court by the single judge. The facts are as follows. The applicant lived with his mother at 28 Harmood Street in Camden. At 8.30 am on 16th March 2006 he went to Kentish Town Police Station and reported that he had killed her. Police officers went to the house. In the rear bedroom they found her body, lying dressed only in her night clothes, on the floor, in a pool of blood. Nearby they found a bloodstained knife and a hammer which plainly were the murder weapons. In the living room they found the applicant's crack pipe on a table together with his mother's credit cards. There was evidence that she never willingly would have left out her credit cards because she knew from past experience that the applicant would have used them to obtain cocaine. The postmortem examination showed that she had suffered a compression of her neck and many blows to the head. She had four broken ribs. There were five puncture wounds to her right side, as if she had been poked with a knife tip. There were also marks on the neck caused by the blow. She had suffered in all over 40 blows in the course of this attack. Although the applicant purported to have little or no memory of the events leading up to her death, it seems that the evening before the applicant and his mother had gone out for a meal. Relations between them seemed then to be perfectly amicable. After the meal his mother had returned home and went to bed but the applicant went to a friend's house where he smoked crack cocaine. He returned home later and smoked more crack. In the early hours of the morning it is plain that he attacked his mother with the knife, the hammer and may be also a belt. Shortly after he killed her he took one of her credit cards. At 4.30 am he withdrew £200 from a cash machine and visited a local crack dealer from whom he bought more crack. He then went back home and smoked that. At some stage he must have tidied up a little. He put the murder weapons away. As we have already said, the following morning he went to the police station to report what he had done. There was a pre-sentence report in which the applicant maintained that he could not remember the actual killing but he said that he had experienced a visual and auditory hallucination on the evening of the killing. He said he heard voices as far as back as when he had been in his twenties and the voices instructed him to harm people. The applicant said he believed that his mother had dominated him and he gave the impression that he had not accepted full responsibility. He denied that he had acted as he had done in order to obtain money. The applicant started using cannabis at the age of 18 and at 32 he was introduced to crack. He described his relationship with his mother as close but he said that she was a forceful character. He claimed he had had mental health problems since he was in his early twenties. He said the hallucinations became worse when he smoked crack and drug use made him aggressive. There was a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Johns who was retained by the defence. He thought that the applicant presented with apparent signs of severe mental illness. He said he heard voices commanding him to harm himself and others but for various reasons the doctor did not regard the applicant as a reliable informant. Some of the elements in his medical history suggested a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia. But the doctor thought that was unlikely. He thought these symptoms were probably due to malingering. However, although the applicant himself said that his misuse of cocaine had not led to aggression, the doctor thought that it was probable that his consumption of crack could lead to a psychotic state, such as a drug induced psychosis. It was his opinion, therefore, that the attack on his mother could have resulted just from anger or range, but he thought it more probable that it was due to an acute cocaine induced psychosis. The psychiatric report from Dr Chesterman, retained by the prosecution, said that the applicant had become preoccupied with obtaining crack cocaine. He claimed that he had heard voices even in childhood but the apparent psychotic symptoms which he described were not typical of genuine serious mental illness. Indeed he thought that the symptoms complained of were not genuine. He did not accept Dr Johns' conclusion that the applicant was suffering from cocaine-induced psychosis. The doctor noticed that there was evidence in the past that he had stolen from his mother in order to fund his cocaine habit. Whilst recognising that this was a matter for the court, he thought that the applicant had murdered his mother to obtain money to buy more crack cocaine. Dr Johns had been asked to comment on this report, which he did by way of addendum dated 16th October 2006. He reiterated that the applicant did not show signs of severe mental illness. He had fabricated symptoms to provide a partial explanation for his actions but Dr Johns thought it improbable that he had attacked his mother to gain the money to buy cocaine.

Bentley KC and Ms A. Timan appeared on behalf of the Applicant. The Crown were not represented. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © REPORTING RESTRICTIONS APPLY Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, s.45 MR JUSTICE CAVANAGH: Reporting restrictions have been made under section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 with respect to the identification of the victims of the robberies referred to below whilst they remain under the age of 18. Where it is necessary to refer to such victims in this judgment, they have been anonymised accordingly. This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence, leave having been refused by the single judge. On 15 May 2024, the applicant was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court by His Honour Judge Peter Gower KC for two offences of robbery and one of murder. He had pleaded guilty to the offences of robbery and was convicted of murder after a trial. His Honour Judge Gower KC had been the trial judge. For the offence of murder, the applicant was sentenced to custody for life with a minimum term of 25 years and three months, less 479 days spent on remand. For each of the two offences of robbery, the applicant was sentenced to 30 months' detention in a young offender institution to run concurrently with the sentence for murder. The application for leave to appeal relates only to the sentence for murder. In sentencing the applicant for murder, the judge took account of the criminality involved in the two robbery offences. No objection is taken to this course of action which was plainly appropriate in the circumstances. The applicant has been represented before us by Mr David Bentley KC and Ms Annabel Timan, acting pro bono. We are grateful to them for their assistance. The Facts All three offences were committed on the same evening, 30 December 2022. They were committed jointly by the applicant and his younger half-brother, Nyron Thomas. Nyron Thomas was also convicted of murder and was sentenced to be detained at His Majesty's pleasure for a term of 19 years and 10 months, less the 479 days served on remand. At the time of the offences the applicant was 19 years old. His 19th birthday had been about a week before. Nyron Thomas was just under 16½ years old. The brothers did not live together but lived in the same area of London. The first robbery took place at about 5.30 pm in Peckham. The applicant and Nyron Thomas were riding on the same bicycle when they saw a 14-year old boy (""C1""). At the applicant's suggestion, they decided to rob him. The applicant and Nyron were wearing a balaclava and covid mask respectively. They surrounded their victim. The applicant threatened to beat up and stab C1. C1 handed over his mobile phone and put in his iCloud password which enabled the applicant to reset the phone. The applicant sold this phone about an hour later for £200. Later the same evening, the applicant and Nyron Thomas were out in the Peckham area again, this time on two bicycles. They surrounded and confronted two 14-year old boys and demanded that they hand over their mobile phones. The applicant and Nyron Thomas acted in a physically threatening way towards the two boys. The applicant gestured as if to punch the first of the two boys (""C2""), and Nyron Thomas placed his hand inside the waistband of his trousers to indicate that he was concealing a weapon there. C2 handed his iPhone over to the applicant and Nyron, having locked out of iCloud at their request. The other boy, C3, offered to hand over his phone but it was a Samsung and Nyron Thomas indicated that they were not interested in it. The iPhone was also sold by the applicant the next day. Shortly after the second robbery the applicant and his brother cycled to Peckham Rye Park. The murder victim, Kalabe Legasse, was sitting on a bench in a dark and quiet area of the park, talking to a friend on his mobile phone. He was on his own. The applicant and Nyron Thomas set about robbing Mr Legasse of his mobile phone. The friend to whom Mr Legasse was talking heard a person - later identified as Nyron Thomas - asking Mr Legasse who he was and what he was doing there before telling him to take out his phone, and saying, ""I have my nank with me, don't make me mad."" (""Nank"" is a slang word for a knife). At that point Mr Legasse ended his call. A witness in a different part of the park heard raised voices but there were no witnesses to the murder itself. Mr Legasse was killed by a single blow to the heart. He was 29 years old. The applicant and Nyron Thomas were sentenced on the basis that it was Nyron Thomas, not the applicant, who delivered the fatal blow with a large knife which Nyron had been carrying. The force used in the stabbing was such that the knife penetrated to a depth of 11 centimetres, cutting through cartilage and displacing and fracturing a rib. After the stabbing, the applicant and his brother fled the scene without calling emergency services. They took Mr Legasse's phone with them and it was sold by the applicant the following day. The knife was subsequently found by the police in the bedroom of the brother's grandmother. It was a large ""zombie-style"" knife. The applicant was of previous good character. Sentencing Remarks At the sentencing hearing the judge had before him a pre-sentence report for the applicant and for Nyron, defence sentencing notes, character references, and a letter written by the applicant. In his careful and thorough sentencing remarks, the judge took as his starting point for the sentencing of the applicant, before taking into account any aggravating or mitigating features, the minimum term of 30 years. This was because as the murder took place in furtherance of a robbery it was a murder for gain, and so was an offence of particularly high seriousness as defined by paragraph 3(2)(c) of Schedule 21 to the Sentencing Act 2020. In such cases the appropriate starting point when determining the minimum term is 30 years. As Nyron was 16 years old at the time of the murder, the appropriate starting point for him was 20 years pursuant to paragraph 5A(2) of Schedule 21. The judge said that there was no question of Nyron stabbing Mr Legasse in self-defence and, giving Nyron the benefit of the doubt, sentenced him on the basis that he simply did not care whether he killed Mr Legasse or not, rather than on the basis that he had intended to kill Mr Legasse. As for the applicant, the judge said that it was clear from the jury's verdict that they were sure he had intentionally assisted or encouraged Nyron to attack Mr Legasse, that he intended that Nyron would attack Mr Legasse with the intention of causing him at least really serious bodily harm should it be necessary or desirable to do so. The judge was satisfied that the applicant knew that Nyron had a knife with him. The judge accepted, however, that the applicant may not have intended that Nyron would use the knife with intent to kill. The judge said that he had taken account of the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v Kamarra-Jarra [2024] EWCA Crim 198 , [2024] 2 C.App.R (S) 19. This judgment gives guidance to sentencing judges as to how they should approach the sentencing of co-defendants in circumstances in which one is below and one is above an age which is a significant cut-off for sentencing purposes. So far as mitigation is concerned, the judge took account of the applicant's age. Moreover, the judge said that the applicant was immature for his age. The judge noted that the writer of the pre-sentence report said that the applicant's emotional presentation and intellectual development was akin to that of a younger person. The judge also noted that his mother had said that he was always viewed as the younger sibling to Nyron. The applicant and Nyron witnessed domestic violence as young children and did not benefit from a male role model when growing up. The judge gave credit to the applicant for his previous good character, and for his guilty pleas to the offence of robbery. The judge decided that the 30-year starting point should be discounted to reflect the applicant's immaturity and in order to ensure that the minimum term in the applicant's case bore some comparison with that imposed on his brother. The judge took into account that, although he did not inflict the fatal blow and may not have intended that Nyron would use the knife with intent to kill, the applicant was the older brother by more than two and a half years and the applicant had encouraged Nyron to do what he did. The judge said that if he had been sentencing the applicant for murder on its own the appropriate minimum term would have been 24 years. He said that this sentence had to be increased to reflect the criminality involved in the two robberies, whilst bearing in mind the principle of totality. The judge decided upon an increase of 15 months, making a total sentence of 25 years and three months, less time served on remand. As for Nyron, the judge said that if he had been sentencing him for murder alone, and taking account of the aggravating and mitigating features, he would have sentenced Nyron to a minimum term of 19 years. He increased this by 10 months to reflect the two robberies, resulting in a total sentence of 19 years and 10 months, less time served on remand. Grounds of Appeal The applicant does not dispute that the appropriate starting point for him in accordance with Schedule 21 was 30 years or that the appropriate starting point for his brother was 20 years. The grounds of appeal rely upon three interconnected matters in support of the submission that the minimum term imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive. The first is the disparity in sentences imposed upon the applicant and his brother Nyron. It was submitted that insufficient regard was given by the judge to parity of sentence. Whilst the applicant was two and a half years older than his brother, it was Nyron who was the stabber and, it was submitted, it was clear that the applicant was deeply immature and was frequently treated by his family as if he were the younger of the two brothers. The second matter was that the judge had made insufficient allowance for the elder sibling's immaturity; and the third was that the judge did not make sufficient allowance for the fact that the applicant's role was limited to encouragement and/or assistance. Mr Bentley submitted that in this case the applicant (the older brother) was in reality no more mature than his younger brother. Discussion and Conclusions Parliament has determined that there should be a 10-year difference in the starting point for those who have been convicted of murder for gain who are aged over 18 years as compared with those who are aged 15 or 16. This can give rise to difficult sentencing decisions because sentencing judges must respect the will of Parliament. But they must also take account of the principles of fairness and must seek, if possible, to avoid excessive disparity of sentencing between offenders who are otherwise in a similar position. This issue was addressed by the Court of Appeal in Kamarra-Jarra . In that case, the Lady Chief Justice, sitting with Lord Justice Holroyde (Vice President of the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division) and Mrs Justice Stacey, said: ""28 As for age, paragraph 1.5 of the Sentencing Council Guideline for Sentencing Children and Young People reads: ' ... Children and young people are not fully developed and they have not attained full maturity. As such, this can impact on their decision making and risk-taking behaviour. It is important to consider the extent to which the child or young person has been acting impulsively and whether their conduct has been affected by inexperience, emotional volatility or negative influences. They may not fully appreciate the effect their actions can have on other people and may not be capable of fully understanding the distress and pain they cause to the victims of their crimes. Children and young people are also likely to be susceptible to peer pressure and other external influences and changes taking place during adolescence can lead to experimentation, resulting in criminal behaviour. When considering a child or young person's age their emotional and developmental age is of at least equal importance to their chronological age (if not greater).' Consistent with this, the authorities have long emphasised that it should be borne in mind that although 18th and 21st birthdays represent significant moments in the life of an individual, they are not necessarily indicative of the individual's true level of maturity, insight and understanding: see, for example, R v Peters, Palmer and Campbell [2005] EWCA Crim 605 ; [2005] 2 Cr App R(S) 101 (""Peters"") at [11], and R v Matthews [2005] EWCA Crim 2399; [2006] 1 Cr App R(S) 88 at [6]. In R v Clarke and Others [2018] EWCA Crim 185 , Lord Burnett of Maldon said at [5]: 'Reaching the age of 18 has many legal consequences, but it does not present a cliff edge for the purposes of sentencing. So much has long been clear. The discussion in R v Peters [2005] EWCA Crim 605 , [2005] 2 Cr App R(S) 101 is an example of its application: see paras [10]-[12]. Full maturity and all the attributes of adulthood are not magically conferred on young people on their 18th birthdays. Experience of life reflected in scientific research (e.g. The Age of Adolescence: ... 17 January 2018) is that young people continue to mature, albeit at different rates, for some time beyond their 18th birthdays. The youth and maturity of an offender will be factors that inform any sentencing decision, even if an offender has passed his or her 18th birthday. ... ' More recently in R v ZA [2023] EWCA Crim 596 (""ZA""), at [52] May J, Judicial Lead for Youth Justice, said this: 'It has been recognised for some time that the brains of young people are still developing up to the age of 25, particularly in the areas of the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These areas are the seat of emotional control, restraint, awareness of risk and the ability to appreciate the consequences of one's own and others' actions; in short, the processes of thought engaged in by, and the hallmark of, mature and responsible adults. It is also known that adverse childhood experiences, educational difficulties and mental health issues negatively affect the development of those adult thought processes. ... ' Further, where two or more offenders fall to be sentenced in respect of the same murder, some of whom are just over 18 and some of whom are just under 18, it would be neither just nor rational for significantly divergent terms to be imposed on grounds of age alone: see R v Taylor (Joel) [2017] EWCA Crim 803; [2008] (sic) [2018] 1 Cr App R(S) 4 (""Taylor"") at [8]. The proper approach is to move from each starting point to a position where any disparity is no more than a fair reflection of the age difference: see Attorney General's References Nos 143 and 144 (R v Brown and Carty) [2007] EWCA Crim 1245 ; [2008] 1 Cr App R(S) 28 at [27]. The advent of section 127 does not dictate a different approach when sentencing either a defendant who has just turned 18 or who is just under 18. It is never just a question of mathematical age. Age governs the normal starting point for a minimum term, but not the assessment of culpability by reference to maturity. The court is always obliged to look beyond mere chronological age. In Attorney General's Reference (R v SK) [2022] EWCA Crim 1421 ; [2023] 1 Cr App R(S) 26 , a case involving a 16½ year old convicted of murder, William Davis LJ noted at [27] that the principles set out in Peters remain valid, and in particular referred to what was said there at [11]: 'Therefore although the normal starting point is governed by the defendant's age, when assessing his culpability, the sentencing judge should reflect on and make allowances, as appropriate upwards or downwards, for the level of the offender's maturity.' The reference in paragraph 33 of Kamarra-Jarra to section 127 is to section 127 of the Police Crime and Sentencing [and Courts] Act 2022 which, for the first time, introduced a sliding scale of starting points for minimum terms for children convicted of murder, taking into consideration the nature of the charge and the seriousness of the murder. That sliding scale is now set out in paragraph 5A of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020. It is clear that, in the present case, the judge took account of the guidance given by the Lady Chief Justice in Kamarra-Jarra . As we have said, he specifically said that he did so in his sentencing remarks. He also said that he discounted the sentence that he imposed on the applicant in order to ensure that the minimum term in the applicant's case bore some comparison with that imposed on his brother. In our judgment, it is not arguable that the judge erred in failing to take proper account of the impact of the different starting points that apply to the two defendants. He plainly bore it in mind. He looked beyond mere chronological age. It should also be noted that the observations of the Lady Chief Justice in Kamarra-Jarra were made in the context of a case in which the appellant was just over 18, at 18 years and four months old at the time of the murder, whilst his co-defendants were, respectively, 17 years and 10 months old and 17 years and nine months old. The difference in age between the defendants in that case was, therefore, no more than six or seven months. In contrast, the difference in age between the defendants in the present case, as Mr Bentley fairly acknowledged, is much more substantial, being approximately two and a half years. Moreover, the difference in starting points for defendants who are 17 or 18 years old respectively for murders of particularly high seriousness is much narrower than the difference for defendants who are respectively 16 and 19 years old. The starting point in such a case for a 17-year old is 27 years, only three years less than the 30-year starting point which applies to a defendant who is 18 or 19 or older. In contrast, the starting point for a 15 or 16-year old is 20 years. It is likely, if not inevitable, therefore, that in order to give effect to Parliament's intentions the sentencing exercise that applies to a 16-year old and to a 19-year old will result in sentences that are considerably further apart than would be the case if one was not much short of their eighteenth birthday at the time of the offence and the other had not long passed their eighteenth birthday. Again, it is not arguable that the judge failed to make adequate allowance for the applicant's immaturity and the fact that he was not the stabber, when deciding on the minimum term of 25 years and three months less time spent on remand. The judge was well aware of the facts of the case and he took full account of the evidence before him of the applicant's immaturity. This was a gratuitous and pointless murder in the course of the robbery of a member of the public of his mobile phone. It took place in a public location, a park, at night, in the dark. There were two offenders; they acted as a team. They had taken a knife to the scene. The applicant knew that his brother was carrying a knife. They made no attempt to seek help for the victim when he was stabbed. It would have been obvious to them that he was very seriously injured, if not dying. They thought only of themselves making their getaway. The applicant even went so far as to sell the victim's phone the following day. The sentence had to take account of the applicant's offending and the two robberies that had taken place on the same evening. The applicant was the principal aggressor in at least one of those robberies. There was no evidence that the applicant had in some way been groomed by his brother or had been pressurised into accompanying him in the robbery spree. In all of the circumstances, it is not arguable that a sentence that was nearly five years lower than the starting point set out in Schedule 21, and one which also took account of two robbery offences, was manifestly excessive for the murder that was committed by the applicant. This was a significant discount to take account of immaturity and disparity. For these reasons permission to appeal is refused.

Bentley KC and Ms A. Timan appeared on behalf of the Applicant. The Crown were not represented. ____________________ ____________________ REPORTING RESTRICTIONS APPLY Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, s.45 MR JUSTICE CAVANAGH: Reporting restrictions have been made under section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 with respect to the identification of the victims of the robberies referred to below whilst they remain under the age of 18. Where it is necessary to refer to such victims in this judgment, they have been anonymised accordingly. This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence, leave having been refused by the single judge. On 15 May 2024, the applicant was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court by His Honour Judge Peter Gower KC for two offences of robbery and one of murder. He had pleaded guilty to the offences of robbery and was convicted of murder after a trial. His Honour Judge Gower KC had been the trial judge. For the offence of murder, the applicant was sentenced to custody for life with a minimum term of 25 years and three months, less 479 days spent on remand. For each of the two offences of robbery, the applicant was sentenced to 30 months' detention in a young offender institution to run concurrently with the sentence for murder. The application for leave to appeal relates only to the sentence for murder. In sentencing the applicant for murder, the judge took account of the criminality involved in the two robbery offences. No objection is taken to this course of action which was plainly appropriate in the circumstances. The applicant has been represented before us by Mr David Bentley KC and Ms Annabel Timan, acting pro bono. We are grateful to them for their assistance. The Facts All three offences were committed on the same evening, 30 December 2022. They were committed jointly by the applicant and his younger half-brother, Nyron Thomas. Nyron Thomas was also convicted of murder and was sentenced to be detained at His Majesty's pleasure for a term of 19 years and 10 months, less the 479 days served on remand. At the time of the offences the applicant was 19 years old. His 19th birthday had been about a week before. Nyron Thomas was just under 16½ years old. The brothers did not live together but lived in the same area of London. The first robbery took place at about 5.30 pm in Peckham. The applicant and Nyron Thomas were riding on the same bicycle when they saw a 14-year old boy (""C1""). At the applicant's suggestion, they decided to rob him. The applicant and Nyron were wearing a balaclava and covid mask respectively. They surrounded their victim. The applicant threatened to beat up and stab C1. C1 handed over his mobile phone and put in his iCloud password which enabled the applicant to reset the phone. The applicant sold this phone about an hour later for £200. Later the same evening, the applicant and Nyron Thomas were out in the Peckham area again, this time on two bicycles. They surrounded and confronted two 14-year old boys and demanded that they hand over their mobile phones. The applicant and Nyron Thomas acted in a physically threatening way towards the two boys. The applicant gestured as if to punch the first of the two boys (""C2""), and Nyron Thomas placed his hand inside the waistband of his trousers to indicate that he was concealing a weapon there. C2 handed his iPhone over to the applicant and Nyron, having locked out of iCloud at their request. The other boy, C3, offered to hand over his phone but it was a Samsung and Nyron Thomas indicated that they were not interested in it. The iPhone was also sold by the applicant the next day. Shortly after the second robbery the applicant and his brother cycled to Peckham Rye Park. The murder victim, Kalabe Legasse, was sitting on a bench in a dark and quiet area of the park, talking to a friend on his mobile phone. He was on his own. The applicant and Nyron Thomas set about robbing Mr Legasse of his mobile phone. The friend to whom Mr Legasse was talking heard a person - later identified as Nyron Thomas - asking Mr Legasse who he was and what he was doing there before telling him to take out his phone, and saying, ""I have my nank with me, don't make me mad."" (""Nank"" is a slang word for a knife). At that point Mr Legasse ended his call. A witness in a different part of the park heard raised voices but there were no witnesses to the murder itself. Mr Legasse was killed by a single blow to the heart. He was 29 years old. The applicant and Nyron Thomas were sentenced on the basis that it was Nyron Thomas, not the applicant, who delivered the fatal blow with a large knife which Nyron had been carrying. The force used in the stabbing was such that the knife penetrated to a depth of 11 centimetres, cutting through cartilage and displacing and fracturing a rib. After the stabbing, the applicant and his brother fled the scene without calling emergency services. They took Mr Legasse's phone with them and it was sold by the applicant the following day. The knife was subsequently found by the police in the bedroom of the brother's grandmother. It was a large ""zombie-style"" knife. The applicant was of previous good character. Sentencing Remarks At the sentencing hearing the judge had before him a pre-sentence report for the applicant and for Nyron, defence sentencing notes, character references, and a letter written by the applicant. In his careful and thorough sentencing remarks, the judge took as his starting point for the sentencing of the applicant, before taking into account any aggravating or mitigating features, the minimum term of 30 years. This was because as the murder took place in furtherance of a robbery it was a murder for gain, and so was an offence of particularly high seriousness as defined by paragraph 3(2)(c) of Schedule 21 to the Sentencing Act 2020. In such cases the appropriate starting point when determining the minimum term is 30 years. As Nyron was 16 years old at the time of the murder, the appropriate starting point for him was 20 years pursuant to paragraph 5A(2) of Schedule 21. The judge said that there was no question of Nyron stabbing Mr Legasse in self-defence and, giving Nyron the benefit of the doubt, sentenced him on the basis that he simply did not care whether he killed Mr Legasse or not, rather than on the basis that he had intended to kill Mr Legasse. As for the applicant, the judge said that it was clear from the jury's verdict that they were sure he had intentionally assisted or encouraged Nyron to attack Mr Legasse, that he intended that Nyron would attack Mr Legasse with the intention of causing him at least really serious bodily harm should it be necessary or desirable to do so. The judge was satisfied that the applicant knew that Nyron had a knife with him. The judge accepted, however, that the applicant may not have intended that Nyron would use the knife with intent to kill. The judge said that he had taken account of the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in R v Kamarra-Jarra [2024] EWCA Crim 198 , [2024] 2 C.App.R (S) 19. This judgment gives guidance to sentencing judges as to how they should approach the sentencing of co-defendants in circumstances in which one is below and one is above an age which is a significant cut-off for sentencing purposes. So far as mitigation is concerned, the judge took account of the applicant's age. Moreover, the judge said that the applicant was immature for his age. The judge noted that the writer of the pre-sentence report said that the applicant's emotional presentation and intellectual development was akin to that of a younger person. The judge also noted that his mother had said that he was always viewed as the younger sibling to Nyron. The applicant and Nyron witnessed domestic violence as young children and did not benefit from a male role model when growing up. The judge gave credit to the applicant for his previous good character, and for his guilty pleas to the offence of robbery. The judge decided that the 30-year starting point should be discounted to reflect the applicant's immaturity and in order to ensure that the minimum term in the applicant's case bore some comparison with that imposed on his brother. The judge took into account that, although he did not inflict the fatal blow and may not have intended that Nyron would use the knife with intent to kill, the applicant was the older brother by more than two and a half years and the applicant had encouraged Nyron to do what he did. The judge said that if he had been sentencing the applicant for murder on its own the appropriate minimum term would have been 24 years. He said that this sentence had to be increased to reflect the criminality involved in the two robberies, whilst bearing in mind the principle of totality. The judge decided upon an increase of 15 months, making a total sentence of 25 years and three months, less time served on remand. As for Nyron, the judge said that if he had been sentencing him for murder alone, and taking account of the aggravating and mitigating features, he would have sentenced Nyron to a minimum term of 19 years. He increased this by 10 months to reflect the two robberies, resulting in a total sentence of 19 years and 10 months, less time served on remand. Grounds of Appeal The applicant does not dispute that the appropriate starting point for him in accordance with Schedule 21 was 30 years or that the appropriate starting point for his brother was 20 years. The grounds of appeal rely upon three interconnected matters in support of the submission that the minimum term imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive. The first is the disparity in sentences imposed upon the applicant and his brother Nyron. It was submitted that insufficient regard was given by the judge to parity of sentence. Whilst the applicant was two and a half years older than his brother, it was Nyron who was the stabber and, it was submitted, it was clear that the applicant was deeply immature and was frequently treated by his family as if he were the younger of the two brothers. The second matter was that the judge had made insufficient allowance for the elder sibling's immaturity; and the third was that the judge did not make sufficient allowance for the fact that the applicant's role was limited to encouragement and/or assistance. Mr Bentley submitted that in this case the applicant (the older brother) was in reality no more mature than his younger brother. Discussion and Conclusions Parliament has determined that there should be a 10-year difference in the starting point for those who have been convicted of murder for gain who are aged over 18 years as compared with those who are aged 15 or 16. This can give rise to difficult sentencing decisions because sentencing judges must respect the will of Parliament. But they must also take account of the principles of fairness and must seek, if possible, to avoid excessive disparity of sentencing between offenders who are otherwise in a similar position. This issue was addressed by the Court of Appeal in Kamarra-Jarra . In that case, the Lady Chief Justice, sitting with Lord Justice Holroyde (Vice President of the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division) and Mrs Justice Stacey, said: ""28 As for age, paragraph 1.5 of the Sentencing Council Guideline for Sentencing Children and Young People reads: ' ... Children and young people are not fully developed and they have not attained full maturity. As such, this can impact on their decision making and risk-taking behaviour. It is important to consider the extent to which the child or young person has been acting impulsively and whether their conduct has been affected by inexperience, emotional volatility or negative influences. They may not fully appreciate the effect their actions can have on other people and may not be capable of fully understanding the distress and pain they cause to the victims of their crimes. Children and young people are also likely to be susceptible to peer pressure and other external influences and changes taking place during adolescence can lead to experimentation, resulting in criminal behaviour. When considering a child or young person's age their emotional and developmental age is of at least equal importance to their chronological age (if not greater).' Consistent with this, the authorities have long emphasised that it should be borne in mind that although 18th and 21st birthdays represent significant moments in the life of an individual, they are not necessarily indicative of the individual's true level of maturity, insight and understanding: see, for example, R v Peters, Palmer and Campbell [2005] EWCA Crim 605 ; [2005] 2 Cr App R(S) 101 (""Peters"") at [11], and R v Matthews [2005] EWCA Crim 2399; [2006] 1 Cr App R(S) 88 at [6]. In R v Clarke and Others [2018] EWCA Crim 185 , Lord Burnett of Maldon said at [5]: 'Reaching the age of 18 has many legal consequences, but it does not present a cliff edge for the purposes of sentencing. So much has long been clear. The discussion in R v Peters [2005] EWCA Crim 605 , [2005] 2 Cr App R(S) 101 is an example of its application: see paras [10]-[12]. Full maturity and all the attributes of adulthood are not magically conferred on young people on their 18th birthdays. Experience of life reflected in scientific research (e.g. The Age of Adolescence: ... 17 January 2018) is that young people continue to mature, albeit at different rates, for some time beyond their 18th birthdays. The youth and maturity of an offender will be factors that inform any sentencing decision, even if an offender has passed his or her 18th birthday. ... ' More recently in R v ZA [2023] EWCA Crim 596 (""ZA""), at [52] May J, Judicial Lead for Youth Justice, said this: 'It has been recognised for some time that the brains of young people are still developing up to the age of 25, particularly in the areas of the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These areas are the seat of emotional control, restraint, awareness of risk and the ability to appreciate the consequences of one's own and others' actions; in short, the processes of thought engaged in by, and the hallmark of, mature and responsible adults. It is also known that adverse childhood experiences, educational difficulties and mental health issues negatively affect the development of those adult thought processes. ... ' Further, where two or more offenders fall to be sentenced in respect of the same murder, some of whom are just over 18 and some of whom are just under 18, it would be neither just nor rational for significantly divergent terms to be imposed on grounds of age alone: see R v Taylor (Joel) [2017] EWCA Crim 803; [2008] (sic) [2018] 1 Cr App R(S) 4 (""Taylor"") at [8]. The proper approach is to move from each starting point to a position where any disparity is no more than a fair reflection of the age difference: see Attorney General's References Nos 143 and 144 (R v Brown and Carty) [2007] EWCA Crim 1245 ; [2008] 1 Cr App R(S) 28 at [27]. The advent of section 127 does not dictate a different approach when sentencing either a defendant who has just turned 18 or who is just under 18. It is never just a question of mathematical age. Age governs the normal starting point for a minimum term, but not the assessment of culpability by reference to maturity. The court is always obliged to look beyond mere chronological age. In Attorney General's Reference (R v SK) [2022] EWCA Crim 1421 ; [2023] 1 Cr App R(S) 26 , a case involving a 16½ year old convicted of murder, William Davis LJ noted at [27] that the principles set out in Peters remain valid, and in particular referred to what was said there at [11]: 'Therefore although the normal starting point is governed by the defendant's age, when assessing his culpability, the sentencing judge should reflect on and make allowances, as appropriate upwards or downwards, for the level of the offender's maturity.' The reference in paragraph 33 of Kamarra-Jarra to section 127 is to section 127 of the Police Crime and Sentencing Act 2022 which, for the first time, introduced a sliding scale of starting points for minimum terms for children convicted of murder, taking into consideration the nature of the charge and the seriousness of the murder. That sliding scale is now set out in paragraph 5A of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020. It is clear that, in the present case, the judge took account of the guidance given by the Lady Chief Justice in Kamarra-Jarra . As we have said, he specifically said that he did so in his sentencing remarks. He also said that he discounted the sentence that he imposed on the applicant in order to ensure that the minimum term in the applicant's case bore some comparison with that imposed on his brother. In our judgment, it is not arguable that the judge erred in failing to take proper account of the impact of the different starting points that apply to the two defendants. He plainly bore it in mind. He looked beyond mere chronological age. It should also be noted that the observations of the Lady Chief Justice in Kamarra-Jarra were made in the context of a case in which the appellant was just over 18, at 18 years and four months old at the time of the murder, whilst his co-defendants were, respectively, 17 years and 10 months old and 17 years and nine months old. The difference in age between the defendants in that case was, therefore, no more than six or seven months. In contrast, the difference in age between the defendants in the present case, as Mr Bentley fairly acknowledged, is much more substantial, being approximately two and a half years. Moreover, the difference in starting points for defendants who are 17 or 18 years old respectively for murders of particularly high seriousness is much narrower than the difference for defendants who are respectively 16 and 19 years old. The starting point in such a case for a 17-year old is 27 years, only three years less than the 30-year starting point which applies to a defendant who is 18 or 19 or older. In contrast, the starting point for a 15 or 16-year old is 20 years. It is likely, if not inevitable, therefore, that in order to give effect to Parliament's intentions the sentencing exercise that applies to a 16-year old and to a 19-year old will result in sentences that are considerably further apart than would be the case if one was not much short of their eighteenth birthday at the time of the offence and the other had not long passed their eighteenth birthday. Again, it is not arguable that the judge failed to make adequate allowance for the applicant's immaturity and the fact that he was not the stabber, when deciding on the minimum term of 25 years and three months less time spent on remand. The judge was well aware of the facts of the case and he took full account of the evidence before him of the applicant's immaturity. This was a gratuitous and pointless murder in the course of the robbery of a member of the public of his mobile phone. It took place in a public location, a park, at night, in the dark. There were two offenders; they acted as a team. They had taken a knife to the scene. The applicant knew that his brother was carrying a knife. They made no attempt to seek help for the victim when he was stabbed. It would have been obvious to them that he was very seriously injured, if not dying. They thought only of themselves making their getaway. The applicant even went so far as to sell the victim's phone the following day. The sentence had to take account of the applicant's offending and the two robberies that had taken place on the same evening. The applicant was the principal aggressor in at least one of those robberies. There was no evidence that the applicant had in some way been groomed by his brother or had been pressurised into accompanying him in the robbery spree. In all of the circumstances, it is not arguable that a sentence that was nearly five years lower than the starting point set out in Schedule 21, and one which also took account of two robbery offences, was manifestly excessive for the murder that was committed by the applicant. This was a significant discount to take account of immaturity and disparity. For these reasons permission to appeal is refused."

MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: On 2 August 2007, at the Central Criminal Court before the Recorder of London and a jury, Mr Toussaint-Collins was convicted of murder. He now appeals against that conviction by leave of the Single Judge. The victim of the murder was a man called Jason Green. That he was murdered is beyond question. He was shot through the heart as he sat in his car with his two young sons outside his home in Wembley at about 8.25 on the morning of 18 July 2006. Jason Green and his brother had been suspected by the police of being responsible for the murder of a man named Shaun Stanislas, known as ""Stubbs"", in March 2005. They were both arrested on suspicion of that murder, but in the absence of sufficient evidence to prosecute they were never charged. It was the case for the Crown that the appellant was an associate of Stanislas and was one of a number of otherwise unidentified persons who arranged and participated in the murder of Jason Green in revenge. Many other suspects were arrested. None of them were charged. The case for the prosecution rested upon the identification of the appellant by a 15-year old girl, perhaps 14 at the date of these events, known at the trial by a pseudonym of ""Lucy York"". She was walking to school with her sister, known at the trial as ""Ruby Crewe"", and her mother known at the trial as ""Danielle Leeds"". Whilst Danielle and Ruby both gave evidence of the events surrounding the murder, neither was able to make any positive identification of anyone presented to them as suspects. As the two girls walked along Bowater Road, the street in which the murder took place, they noticed a man dressed in purple clothing come from behind them and jog towards a silver Audi, which was on the opposite side of the road facing away from them. This was in fact the car driven by Jason Green. As the man in purple passed them he appeared to nod his head giving what the prosecution asserted was a signal to the waiting gunman. The two girls continued along Bowater Road and passed another silver car, a stolen VW Golf, that was facing them as they walked along. They both saw two black men inside the car. The driver was wearing something like a beanie hat, or perhaps a hood, pulled down to cover his hair, but not his face. The passenger, who the prosecution alleged was the appellant, was light skinned and wearing a balaclava. Lucy York said she could see his eyes, his cheeks and his mouth. It is not surprising that Lucy paid some attention to a man wearing a balaclava in a parked car in a suburban street at 8.25 in the morning in the middle of July. Lucy and her sister walked past the car without stopping. They had gone only a few paces when Lucy heard the sound of a shot and looked around. She saw the man from the driver's seat of the silver Golf in the middle of the road. He was pointing a gun and shooting at the deceased in his car. The gunman had both hands on the gun and fired it twice. With that Lucy and her sister ran up the road towards a green car which was parked further up the road. That car contained two or three black men, one of whom had a gun similar to the one she had seen. The green car sped off. The girls were unable to say what happened to the Golf. They ran back to the scene of the shooting where their mother and younger brother were hiding, and where they saw the body of the deceased slumped across the passenger seat of his car. This must have been a very frightening and disturbing experience for Lucy and her sister. Nonetheless, Lucy had the good sense to telephone the police and dialed 999 from her mobile phone. She was at the time inevitably somewhat confused and no doubt also very frightened by what she had just witnessed. However, the events were fresh in her mind and she gave the police such help as she could. She said in the course of that 999 call: ""There were two people in a silver car and they came running and they shot this guy in another silver car and jumped in a green car and they were driven off. I think there were three shooters."" Lucy was taken to the police station where she was interviewed: an interview which was video recorded. She described the man in the passenger seat of the silver car, allegedly the appellant, as wearing a balaclava. She could see the area of his eyes and mouth and she said that his cheeks were quite chubby. He was light skinned, but not as if he was of mixed race. He was wearing dark clothing. She was asked this by the interviewing officer: ""Q. Would you recognise either of them, that is to say, the driver and the passenger in the silver car?"" A. I think I would probably the darker man."" On 27 July 2006, nine days after the incident, Lucy again went to the police station this time to view a video identification parade. The whole procedure was recorded and members of the court have seen that recording. The procedure followed was that of the VIPER procedure. The images to be compared with that of the appellant had been selected from a larger number by the appellant's solicitor. In our judgment, having viewed the DVD of the procedure, the people selected bore an obvious general similarity to the appearance of the appellant himself. Lucy watched the VIPER film containing, as it did, eight images of men who could not have been involved in the incident and an image of the appellant himself who was at number 3 in the sequence watched by Lucy. She was required to watch the sequence twice, which she did. She was then asked if she wished to see the sequence again and any image from it. She asked to see image number 3, which she viewed. She was then asked again if she wished to see the whole sequence repeated or any particular image from it, and she asked to see number 2. At trial she explained she thought she asked to see number 2 because she wondered if that might have been the driver of the car. Finally, she was asked whether she could identify anyone. She replied: ""I think number 3"". She made a further statement that same day in which she clarified that the person she had purported to identify was the man in the passenger seat of the silver Golf motorcar, wearing the balaclava. About ten minutes after the murder a witness saw a van leave waste ground in an area about a kilometre away from the murder scene, known as Cool Oak Lane. The witness saw a vehicle on fire and another next to it. Fire services were called immediately and discovered at that location the stolen VW Golf, which was on fire, and the green Vauxhall, as it turned out, which had been the other car involved. The Vauxhall was not alight, but its interior had been doused with petrol. In the event, no forensic evidence was recovered from the VW Golf and none that assisted the prosecution's case against the appellant from the Vectra. It was not, of course, the prosecution's case that the appellant had ever been in the Vectra. The prosecution asserted that the identification of the appellant by Lucy was supported by two pieces of evidence. First, there was evidence from the analysis of the data from two mobile telephones attributed to the appellant. The analyst was asked to consider the data from the mobile phones in respect of five locations: first, the Cool Oak Lane area where the cars had been disposed of after the murder; second an address in Derwent Rise, the home of the appellant's mother and the place which he said he had been at, at all material times, in the notice of alibi; third, the road where the murder had been committed; fourth, an address in Janson Close associated with the appellant and where apparently he sometimes stayed; and fifth, an address in Bravington Road, which is where the appellant's girlfriend, Selina, then lived. The analyst was given the core data records of the phones provided to him, during the period with which the trial was concerned. The analyst identified a call from one of the mobile phones at about 12.50am on the morning of 17 July, that is to say the morning of the murder itself, and that was transmitted through the best server for Bowater Road, the murder scene. He identified seven calls from that same mobile phone from between about 4.30am and 4.40am using the best server for the waste ground at Cool Oak Lane where the vehicles used in the murder had been destroyed. Finally, he identified two incoming text messages to the second mobile phone attributable to the appellant at 8.37am on the morning of the murder, using the best server for Janson Close, the address associated with the appellant. However, when the analyst was cross-examined he confirmed that he could not exclude the possibility that the calls, which he described, could have been routed through a cell site other than the ones relied on by the prosecution. He could not deny the possibility that certain of the calls had been made, or received, within the Derwent Rise area where the appellant had asserted, through his notice of alibi, he had been at all material time. The second aspect of the prosecution evidence relied on in support of the identification made by Lucy York were two letters: one from William Marshall with the name of ""Yogi"" or ""Bear"" to the appellant, who was known as ""Tucks"" or ""Tucka"", which had been found by the police on 26 July 2006 during the search of the appellant's mother's address. The second letter relied upon by the prosecution was from the appellant to a man called Terry Watson known as ""Weezy"", also found on 26 July during a search of 55 Janson Close, the address associated with the appellant. Both letters refer to the death of Shaun Stanislas. The letter written by Marshall to the appellant was couched in the form of street slang, which was clarified at trial by a police officer on his understanding of the language used by the young black population in North West London. The letter had been written about a year after the murder of Stanislas and five months, or so, before the murder of Jason Green. The author of the letter was bemoaning the fact that nobody had taken revenge for the death of Stanislas. The second letter was written by the appellant at a time when he was in prison in relation to earlier offences. The stamp was dated 24 March 2005, three days after the murder of Stanislas. The letter clearly demonstrated, said the prosecution, that the appellant knew Stanislas at the time of his death, and the tone of the letter demonstrated that he was very upset by the news of the killing. The second letter was written by the appellant at the time when he was in custody in relation to wholly unrelated matters. Following his arrest the appellant was interviewed. He exercised his right to remain silent. At the end of the interview he submitted a prepared statement saying: ""One, the person who picked me out is mistaken; two, I was not at the scene nor was I in a silver motor vehicle on 18th July 2006."" The appellant himself did not give evidence relying instead on his statement to the police. He did, however, call his girlfriend who gave evidence, which, to some extent, supported the appellant's alibi. At the close of the prosecution case there was a submission that there was no case to answer. The first ground of appeal relates to the rejection by the learned Recorder of that submission. In outline the appellant submits that the identification evidence against the appellant was so poor, self-contradictory and unsupported by other persuasive evidence that the case should have been stopped. Further, it is asserted that the identification procedure used was flawed because the participants were not wearing balaclavas when their faces were shown to the witnesses, thus depriving the witness of an opportunity to make a proper identification. Although no application was made to exclude the evidence of identification under section 78 at the trial, it is said that such an application should have been made and if it had been made it would have succeeded. The appellant further submits that the judge wrongly admitted in evidence the two letters written to and from the appellant, to which we have referred. Leave was not granted in respect of that ground, but renewed before us. Since the evidence relating to those letters was expressly relied upon by the judge in rejecting the submission of no case, it is clearly sensible to deal with that matter first. In relation to the letter written to the appellant by Marshall, it is submitted by the appellant that the letter and its contents were hearsay, written as they were by someone who was not party to the proceedings. The prosecution sought to use the letter as evidence suggesting a motive for the appellant to be involved in the murder and his state of mind towards those who had murdered Stanislas. The finding of the letter and its importance was opened to the jury by the prosecution without objection being taken, but in the course of the trial itself objection was taken on the basis that the letter was hearsay, was not written by the appellant and therefore reveals only its author's state of mind and not that of the appellant. Those submissions were met by the repost of the prosecution that the appellant had kept the letter for many months in a place that demonstrated that it had a value to the appellant in terms of its subject matter. It is right, as Mr Grunwald QC, who did not appear for the appellant at his trial, points out, that in giving his ruling the judge did not articulate the factors set out in section 114 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which a court must consider before allowing the admission of hearsay evidence. If he had done so it is said the letter would not have been admitted. Alternatively it is submitted the judge erred in failing to exclude the evidence under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The respondents do not accept that the Marshall letter was caught by the hearsay rules and accordingly it was not incumbent on the judge to consider section 114 at all. The letter that was found at the appellant's mother's home had evidently been written shortly before the first anniversary of the murder of Stanislas. It had therefore been kept by the appellant for four months at his mother's home, which the respondent submitted indicated a value to the appellant in terms of its subject matter, increased the likelihood that the appellant's state of mind was affected by the letter, and supported the inference that he had a reason for his presence at the shooting, namely a desire for revenge. The letter was not used by the respondents at trial, in our judgment, as evidence of the fact that Marshall was himself annoyed that nothing had been done about the death of Stanislas, but to establish the fact that he had made that statement to the appellant, thereby inferentially, if the jury thought it right, affecting the appellant's state of mind. It is accordingly, in our judgment, direct evidence and just as admissible as, for example, an old newspaper article reporting the death of Stanislas. We are satisfied that the objection that the letter was hearsay is misplaced in the context in which it was used by the Crown. If, however, we are wrong about that and the learned Recorder was wrong about that, we are confident that he would have admitted the letter under the provisions of section 114(1)(b) as being in the interests of justice so to do, given its probative value. The letter had a high probative value providing, as it, did a motive for the appellant's presence at the murder scene and by doing so rendering the identification by Lucy a quite remarkable coincidence. The letter lends support to her identification. It is, in our judgment, very important to the case, as a whole. There could be no reason why Marshall would lie in a private letter to the appellant, thus the circumstances in which the letter was written render what is said in it more likely to be true. There is no reason to doubt the reliability of Marshall, at least in so far as what he wrote in the letter is concerned. Further, the appellant had an opportunity himself to give evidence challenging the meaning attributed to the letter by the prosecution. If, therefore, the learned judge had considered the check list under section 114(2) of the 2003 Act we would, in our judgment, undoubtedly have admitted the letter. The second letter posted three days after Stanislas was murdered was written by the appellant. Had it not been for the fact that the appellant was in custody at the time he wrote the letter, the only objection the defence could have taken to the admission of the evidence is on the basis of relevance. That test is clearly satisfied. It shows that the appellant knew Stanislas at the time of his murder, again rendering his identification by Lucy a highly unlikely coincidence. The prosecution were compelled to make an application to adduce evidence of the appellant's bad character, simply to permit the evidence to be adduced, since it is demonstrably written from prison. The judge did address and consider in detail, in giving his ruling, the reason why in his view the letter written by the appellant should be placed before the jury. The appellant submits that there is no evidence about the meaning of the letter. But the letter is written in English, albeit street slang, and its meaning was well within the understanding of the jury. Again, if he wished to do so the appellant could himself have given evidence about what the letter meant; he chose not to do so. The application to adduce the evidence came, it is true, late in the day in the course of the trial itself. Since it was the appellant's own letter there can be no possible disadvantage or prejudice to him in admitting the evidence late. In our judgment the letter did have a probative value, which outweighed any prejudicial effect that the appellant was in prison at the time he wrote it. The judge rightly admitted the evidence relating to both letters and his decision to reject the submission of no case to answer must be considered by us against that conclusion. In rejecting the submission of no case the judge reminded himself that the opportunity for detailed facial examination by Lucy was limited because of the balaclava which concealed most of the man's face and, in any event, the time available for Lucy to see the man she later purported to identify was, on any view, short. Further in evidence Lucy conceded the possibility of a mistake whilst asserting that she was, to use her words, ""pretty sure that she was right"". The judge analysed in considerable detail in giving his reasons the weaknesses of Lucy's identification, the description she had given in the 999 call, and the differences between that account and the statement she later made to the police and gave in her evidence. However, he concluded that all the matters relied on by the defence were matters which the jury could properly take into account in deciding whether they were sure that Lucy's identification was correct, but not of such a nature that he was obliged to remove that decision from them. He concluded that there was clearly support for Lucy's identification first, in the letters which went to demonstrate a motive and, second, from the cell site analysis of phone calls which provided material indicating that on three separate occasions phones attributable to the appellant are to be found making or receiving calls, or messages, in places where one would expect the appellant's phone to be if he was using it, and associated with the events that surrounded the killing. It was not, of course, incumbent upon the jury to reach an adverse verdict so far as the appellant was concerned, but the judge was satisfied that it was safe to leave the case to them, there being, for the reasons we have sufficiently rehearsed, considerable supporting evidence suggesting the accuracy of that identification. It is further submitted on behalf of the appellant that an application should have been made at the trial to exclude the evidence of the identification of the appellant by Lucy on the ground that the identification procedure was fatally flawed. No such application was made at the trial because, so we understand, those then representing the appellant took the view that the circumstances surrounding the identification procedure went to the weight to which the jury should attach to the identification, rather than to its admissibility. It is now said that there was a breach of Code D of PACE. We have already rehearsed what Lucy said when interviewed when asked whether she would recognise either of the men in the silver Golf. The appellant submits that that answer demonstrates that she was asserting clearly she would not be able to recognise the light skinned balaclava wearing passenger, the man asserted to be the appellant. She did not say that in terms and, in our judgment, the appellant's submission on this ground was seeking to over-interpret a single answer by a 15-year old girl in interview. In our judgment the police would actually have acted in breach of Code D had they not held an identification parade. Paragraph 3.12 of the Code states, omitting irrelevant words: ""Whenever ... there is a witness available, who expresses an ability to identify the suspect, or [our emphasise] where there is a reasonable chance of the witness being able to do so ... an identification procedure shall be held unless it is not practicable or it would serve no useful purpose..."" That paragraph imposes a requirement on the investigating officers. However, paragraph 3(13) provides that such an identification procedure may also be held if the officer in charge of the investigation considers it would be useful. It is quite apparent, therefore, that the Code makes it clear that it would be unnecessary for the witness to express an ability to identify the suspect before it becomes a requirement to hold an identification procedure. The fact that Lucy said in interview that she thought she would probably recognise the men, probably the darker one, and later identified someone other than the person that she had indicated in interview she thought she would probably recognise, does not make her evidence of that identification inadmissible providing the identification procedure is properly carried out. It is an ambitious submission, made on behalf of the appellant, that it was, in the circumstances of this case, perverse of the officer in charge of the investigation to consider that inviting Lucy to view the VIPER film in relation to the appellant would be useful and, in our judgment, that submission simply cannot be sustained. The investigating officer was fully entitled to ask that the identification procedure should take place. In our judgment any application to exclude the evidence, on the basis that the procedure was flawed, would inevitably have been rejected. Finally, Mr Grunwald draws the court's attention to the decision in Davidson relating to the anonymity granted to Lucy at the trial. The appellant further points to the guidance given in this court in Mayer and Others [2008] EWCA Crim 1418 . Mr Grunwald does not specifically espouse his submission under that authority, but does point out that this is a case in which the sole, or decisive, evidence indicating the defendant comes from Lucy. Accordingly we should look with care at the granting of anonymity to her in relation to the guidance now available to this court. We have done so. Steps were taken to protect the anonymity of Lucy. In the event, those steps, in our judgment, failed to protect her anonymity. It is quite unnecessary in a judgment such as this to articulate the reasons why that anonymity was not successfully protected. We are confident that the appellant's advisers knew perfectly well who Lucy was by the time of the trial. If we are wrong about that, the circumstances surrounding the granting of the anonymity are such that the judge would, in our judgment, with whatever guidance is now available to him, still have made the anonymity direction that he gave. We are quite satisfied that the evidence of the identification procedure was properly admitted. We are equally satisfied that it was supported by independent evidence both in respect of the motive provided by the letters and by the cell site analysis. The extent to which it was supported by either, or both, of those independent pieces of evidence was a matter for the jury to determine. The judge rightly left it to them to reach their conclusions after a full, fair and detailed summing-up. In those circumstances we are satisfied that this conviction is safe and the appeal is accordingly dismissed.

MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: On 2 August 2007, at the Central Criminal Court before the Recorder of London and a jury, Mr Toussaint-Collins was convicted of murder. He now appeals against that conviction by leave of the Single Judge. The victim of the murder was a man called Jason Green. That he was murdered is beyond question. He was shot through the heart as he sat in his car with his two young sons outside his home in Wembley at about 8.25 on the morning of 18 July 2006. Jason Green and his brother had been suspected by the police of being responsible for the murder of a man named Shaun Stanislas, known as ""Stubbs"", in March 2005. They were both arrested on suspicion of that murder, but in the absence of sufficient evidence to prosecute they were never charged. It was the case for the Crown that the appellant was an associate of Stanislas and was one of a number of otherwise unidentified persons who arranged and participated in the murder of Jason Green in revenge. Many other suspects were arrested. None of them were charged. The case for the prosecution rested upon the identification of the appellant by a 15-year old girl, perhaps 14 at the date of these events, known at the trial by a pseudonym of ""Lucy York"". She was walking to school with her sister, known at the trial as ""Ruby Crewe"", and her mother known at the trial as ""Danielle Leeds"". Whilst Danielle and Ruby both gave evidence of the events surrounding the murder, neither was able to make any positive identification of anyone presented to them as suspects. As the two girls walked along Bowater Road, the street in which the murder took place, they noticed a man dressed in purple clothing come from behind them and jog towards a silver Audi, which was on the opposite side of the road facing away from them. This was in fact the car driven by Jason Green. As the man in purple passed them he appeared to nod his head giving what the prosecution asserted was a signal to the waiting gunman. The two girls continued along Bowater Road and passed another silver car, a stolen VW Golf, that was facing them as they walked along. They both saw two black men inside the car. The driver was wearing something like a beanie hat, or perhaps a hood, pulled down to cover his hair, but not his face. The passenger, who the prosecution alleged was the appellant, was light skinned and wearing a balaclava. Lucy York said she could see his eyes, his cheeks and his mouth. It is not surprising that Lucy paid some attention to a man wearing a balaclava in a parked car in a suburban street at 8.25 in the morning in the middle of July. Lucy and her sister walked past the car without stopping. They had gone only a few paces when Lucy heard the sound of a shot and looked around. She saw the man from the driver's seat of the silver Golf in the middle of the road. He was pointing a gun and shooting at the deceased in his car. The gunman had both hands on the gun and fired it twice. With that Lucy and her sister ran up the road towards a green car which was parked further up the road. That car contained two or three black men, one of whom had a gun similar to the one she had seen. The green car sped off. The girls were unable to say what happened to the Golf. They ran back to the scene of the shooting where their mother and younger brother were hiding, and where they saw the body of the deceased slumped across the passenger seat of his car. This must have been a very frightening and disturbing experience for Lucy and her sister. Nonetheless, Lucy had the good sense to telephone the police and dialed 999 from her mobile phone. She was at the time inevitably somewhat confused and no doubt also very frightened by what she had just witnessed. However, the events were fresh in her mind and she gave the police such help as she could. She said in the course of that 999 call: ""There were two people in a silver car and they came running and they shot this guy in another silver car and jumped in a green car and they were driven off. I think there were three shooters."" Lucy was taken to the police station where she was interviewed: an interview which was video recorded. She described the man in the passenger seat of the silver car, allegedly the appellant, as wearing a balaclava. She could see the area of his eyes and mouth and she said that his cheeks were quite chubby. He was light skinned, but not as if he was of mixed race. He was wearing dark clothing. She was asked this by the interviewing officer: ""Q. Would you recognise either of them, that is to say, the driver and the passenger in the silver car?"" A. I think I would probably the darker man."" On 27 July 2006, nine days after the incident, Lucy again went to the police station this time to view a video identification parade. The whole procedure was recorded and members of the court have seen that recording. The procedure followed was that of the VIPER procedure. The images to be compared with that of the appellant had been selected from a larger number by the appellant's solicitor. In our judgment, having viewed the DVD of the procedure, the people selected bore an obvious general similarity to the appearance of the appellant himself. Lucy watched the VIPER film containing, as it did, eight images of men who could not have been involved in the incident and an image of the appellant himself who was at number 3 in the sequence watched by Lucy. She was required to watch the sequence twice, which she did. She was then asked if she wished to see the sequence again and any image from it. She asked to see image number 3, which she viewed. She was then asked again if she wished to see the whole sequence repeated or any particular image from it, and she asked to see number 2. At trial she explained she thought she asked to see number 2 because she wondered if that might have been the driver of the car. Finally, she was asked whether she could identify anyone. She replied: ""I think number 3"". She made a further statement that same day in which she clarified that the person she had purported to identify was the man in the passenger seat of the silver Golf motorcar, wearing the balaclava. About ten minutes after the murder a witness saw a van leave waste ground in an area about a kilometre away from the murder scene, known as Cool Oak Lane. The witness saw a vehicle on fire and another next to it. Fire services were called immediately and discovered at that location the stolen VW Golf, which was on fire, and the green Vauxhall, as it turned out, which had been the other car involved. The Vauxhall was not alight, but its interior had been doused with petrol. In the event, no forensic evidence was recovered from the VW Golf and none that assisted the prosecution's case against the appellant from the Vectra. It was not, of course, the prosecution's case that the appellant had ever been in the Vectra. The prosecution asserted that the identification of the appellant by Lucy was supported by two pieces of evidence. First, there was evidence from the analysis of the data from two mobile telephones attributed to the appellant. The analyst was asked to consider the data from the mobile phones in respect of five locations: first, the Cool Oak Lane area where the cars had been disposed of after the murder; second an address in Derwent Rise, the home of the appellant's mother and the place which he said he had been at, at all material times, in the notice of alibi; third, the road where the murder had been committed; fourth, an address in Janson Close associated with the appellant and where apparently he sometimes stayed; and fifth, an address in Bravington Road, which is where the appellant's girlfriend, Selina, then lived. The analyst was given the core data records of the phones provided to him, during the period with which the trial was concerned. The analyst identified a call from one of the mobile phones at about 12.50am on the morning of 17 July, that is to say the morning of the murder itself, and that was transmitted through the best server for Bowater Road, the murder scene. He identified seven calls from that same mobile phone from between about 4.30am and 4.40am using the best server for the waste ground at Cool Oak Lane where the vehicles used in the murder had been destroyed. Finally, he identified two incoming text messages to the second mobile phone attributable to the appellant at 8.37am on the morning of the murder, using the best server for Janson Close, the address associated with the appellant. However, when the analyst was cross-examined he confirmed that he could not exclude the possibility that the calls, which he described, could have been routed through a cell site other than the ones relied on by the prosecution. He could not deny the possibility that certain of the calls had been made, or received, within the Derwent Rise area where the appellant had asserted, through his notice of alibi, he had been at all material time. The second aspect of the prosecution evidence relied on in support of the identification made by Lucy York were two letters: one from William Marshall with the name of ""Yogi"" or ""Bear"" to the appellant, who was known as ""Tucks"" or ""Tucka"", which had been found by the police on 26 July 2006 during the search of the appellant's mother's address. The second letter relied upon by the prosecution was from the appellant to a man called Terry Watson known as ""Weezy"", also found on 26 July during a search of 55 Janson Close, the address associated with the appellant. Both letters refer to the death of Shaun Stanislas. The letter written by Marshall to the appellant was couched in the form of street slang, which was clarified at trial by a police officer on his understanding of the language used by the young black population in North West London. The letter had been written about a year after the murder of Stanislas and five months, or so, before the murder of Jason Green. The author of the letter was bemoaning the fact that nobody had taken revenge for the death of Stanislas. The second letter was written by the appellant at a time when he was in prison in relation to earlier offences. The stamp was dated 24 March 2005, three days after the murder of Stanislas. The letter clearly demonstrated, said the prosecution, that the appellant knew Stanislas at the time of his death, and the tone of the letter demonstrated that he was very upset by the news of the killing.

The appellant himself did not give evidence relying instead on his statement to the police. He did, however, call his girlfriend who gave evidence, which, to some extent, supported the appellant's alibi. At the close of the prosecution case there was a submission that there was no case to answer. The first ground of appeal relates to the rejection by the learned Recorder of that submission. In outline the appellant submits that the identification evidence against the appellant was so poor, self-contradictory and unsupported by other persuasive evidence that the case should have been stopped.

However, he concluded that all the matters relied on by the defence were matters which the jury could properly take into account in deciding whether they were sure that Lucy's identification was correct, but not of such a nature that he was obliged to remove that decision from them. He concluded that there was clearly support for Lucy's identification first, in the letters which went to demonstrate a motive and, second, from the cell site analysis of phone calls which provided material indicating that on three separate occasions phones attributable to the appellant are to be found making or receiving calls, or messages, in places where one would expect the appellant's phone to be if he was using it, and associated with the events that surrounded the killing. It was not, of course, incumbent upon the jury to reach an adverse verdict so far as the appellant was concerned, but the judge was satisfied that it was safe to leave the case to them, there being, for the reasons we have sufficiently rehearsed, considerable supporting evidence suggesting the accuracy of that identification. It is further submitted on behalf of the appellant that an application should have been made at the trial to exclude the evidence of the identification of the appellant by Lucy on the ground that the identification procedure was fatally flawed. No such application was made at the trial because, so we understand, those then representing the appellant took the view that the circumstances surrounding the identification procedure went to the weight to which the jury should attach to the identification, rather than to its admissibility. It is now said that there was a breach of Code D of PACE. We have already rehearsed what Lucy said when interviewed when asked whether she would recognise either of the men in the silver Golf. The appellant submits that that answer demonstrates that she was asserting clearly she would not be able to recognise the light skinned balaclava wearing passenger, the man asserted to be the appellant. She did not say that in terms and, in our judgment, the appellant's submission on this ground was seeking to over-interpret a single answer by a 15-year old girl in interview. In our judgment the police would actually have acted in breach of Code D had they not held an identification parade. Paragraph 3.12 of the Code states, omitting irrelevant words: ""Whenever ... there is a witness available, who expresses an ability to identify the suspect, or where there is a reasonable chance of the witness being able to do so ... an identification procedure shall be held unless it is not practicable or it would serve no useful purpose..."" That paragraph imposes a requirement on the investigating officers. However, paragraph 3(13) provides that such an identification procedure may also be held if the officer in charge of the investigation considers it would be useful. It is quite apparent, therefore, that the Code makes it clear that it would be unnecessary for the witness to express an ability to identify the suspect before it becomes a requirement to hold an identification procedure. The fact that Lucy said in interview that she thought she would probably recognise the men, probably the darker one, and later identified someone other than the person that she had indicated in interview she thought she would probably recognise, does not make her evidence of that identification inadmissible providing the identification procedure is properly carried out. It is an ambitious submission, made on behalf of the appellant, that it was, in the circumstances of this case, perverse of the officer in charge of the investigation to consider that inviting Lucy to view the VIPER film in relation to the appellant would be useful and, in our judgment, that submission simply cannot be sustained. The investigating officer was fully entitled to ask that the identification procedure should take place. In our judgment any application to exclude the evidence, on the basis that the procedure was flawed, would inevitably have been rejected. Finally, Mr Grunwald draws the court's attention to the decision in Davidson relating to the anonymity granted to Lucy at the trial. The appellant further points to the guidance given in this court in Mayer and Others [2008] EWCA Crim 1418 . Mr Grunwald does not specifically espouse his submission under that authority, but does point out that this is a case in which the sole, or decisive, evidence indicating the defendant comes from Lucy. Accordingly we should look with care at the granting of anonymity to her in relation to the guidance now available to this court. We have done so. Steps were taken to protect the anonymity of Lucy. In the event, those steps, in our judgment, failed to protect her anonymity. It is quite unnecessary in a judgment such as this to articulate the reasons why that anonymity was not successfully protected. We are confident that the appellant's advisers knew perfectly well who Lucy was by the time of the trial. If we are wrong about that, the circumstances surrounding the granting of the anonymity are such that the judge would, in our judgment, with whatever guidance is now available to him, still have made the anonymity direction that he gave. We are quite satisfied that the evidence of the identification procedure was properly admitted. We are equally satisfied that it was supported by independent evidence both in respect of the motive provided by the letters and by the cell site analysis. The extent to which it was supported by either, or both, of those independent pieces of evidence was a matter for the jury to determine. The judge rightly left it to them to reach their conclusions after a full, fair and detailed summing-up. In those circumstances we are satisfied that this conviction is safe and the appeal is accordingly dismissed."

Lord Justice Singh : Introduction These are four related appeals against sentence brought with the leave of the single judge. The appellants were sentenced by HHJ Lucking QC at the Crown Court at Northampton on 1 November 2019. All four appellants were sentenced for conspiracy to rob, to which they pleaded guilty, and the murder of Reece Ottaway on 1 February 2019, of which they were convicted by the jury after a trial. There was an additional co-defendant by the name of Ethan Sterling, who was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery and the lesser offence of manslaughter. He plays no part in these appeals. Two of the appellants were sentenced for other offences, concurrently with the life sentences for murder. There were two offences of wounding with intent, contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. On 3 October 2018, Adison Smith and Jordan Crowley (also known as Kimpton) inflicted an attack on Christian Fearon. They pleaded guilty to that offence. On 4 October 2018, Crowley was also involved in an attack on Melih Buyukerzurum. He pleaded guilty to that offence also. In addition, Smith pleaded guilty to three counts of conveying articles into prison on 6 January 2018. Again the sentences for those offences were made concurrent to the life sentence for murder. These appeals are in substance against the length of the minimum terms which were imposed for the offence of murder. Cameron Higgs and Alfie Drage received minimum terms of 28 years each. Smith received a minimum term of 31 years and Crowley received one of 34 years. In each case the judge specified the number of days (268 days) which were to be deducted to reflect time spent on remand. The facts Conspiracy to rob and murder The deceased was Reece Ottaway. He was aged 23 when he was murdered. He was known to the appellants as a drug dealer, mainly dealing in cannabis. The deceased lived in Cordwainer House, Northampton, in a one bedroom flat rented by his friend Zak Shortland. On the morning of the murder, the deceased was sleeping with his girlfriend Katie Little, on a mattress in the living room. In total, there were five people sleeping in the flat: the deceased, Katie Little, Zak Shortland, Lucas Porter and Aiden Britten. During the days preceding the murder, the four appellants came up with a plan to rob the deceased of both money and drugs. The deceased had sent a message to Jordan Crowley stating that he had reloaded his stock of drugs and they also believed he had £30,000 in cash in the flat. On the morning of 1 February 2019, the four appellants and Sterling drove across Northampton arriving at Cordwainer House at approximately 1:15 am. The group forced their way into the flat, armed in preparation for the robbery with a machete, other types of large knives and a BB gun. Katie Little awoke to the noise of the men entering the flat and saw that two men were armed with a large knife and a gun. The deceased got out of bed and was immediately surrounded by them. He was threatened with the BB gun and repeatedly stabbed. One of the group struck Katie Little in her face with the knife, cutting her ear. When the five departed, the deceased was slumped in a chair gasping for breath. It was a short and brutal attack. Zak Shortland and Aiden Bitten had barricaded themselves in the bedroom and did not come out until after the appellants and Sterling had left. They went to the aid of the deceased who was bleeding heavily but the stab wounds inflicted led to his death at the scene. The post mortem also revealed a single tramline bruise to the right buttock that suggested a blow from a rod shaped object - the baseball bat. The deceased's iPhone and some cash around £20 was stolen by one of the appellants. The appellants left in Ethan Sterling's car. CCTV captured Sterling dropping off Crowley and Smith at around 1:36 am. Adison Smith had a noticeable limp, an injury sustained during the attack. Drage and Higgs made their way back to different addresses. Wounding with intent On 3 October 2018, Christian Fearon was outside the Elders Arms pub in Great Billing. He and two friends had stepped outside the pub in order to smoke a cigarette. As they were sitting on a bench a little way down from the pub, a car containing the appellants, Smith and Crowley, pulled up alongside them. Three other men were also in the car, Gavin Munroe, Sonny Stewart and Tyler Metcalfe. The front passenger window of the car was wound down and one of the group, not Smith or Crowley, asked Christian Fearon and his friends whether they were part of ""F 36"", a Northampton gang. Christian Fearon and his friends replied ""no"". The car pulled 100 yards or so down the road. All five got out of the car and walked back to where Christian Fearon and his friends were sitting. They had masks or scarves across their faces. Christian Fearon became separated from his two friends. Whilst Gavin Munro, Sonny Stewart and Tyler Metcalfe stayed back with Christian Fearon's two friends, Smith and Crowley approached Christian Fearon. He repeated to them that he was not part of F 36 and that he had done nothing wrong and tried to calm them down. He turned around and made to run away. As he did so he felt blows to both of his arms and to his back, he had been stabbed three times. The five ran down the street chasing Christian Fearon's two friends before they got back into the car and drove to an area in Blackthorn; Blackthorn being the heart of F 36 territory. They stopped outside the Blackthorn One Stop shop and took a celebratory photograph. It is apparent from videos recorded on that evening that this group of men were driving around Northampton looking for members of F 36 to inflict harm on them. In these videos the men identify themselves variously as 04, or D Block; D Block being a reference to the Duston area of Northampton. Videos taken before the attack show Smith in possession of a machete. By about 5:00 am the following morning of 4 October 2018, Crowley was travelling in the same car with another. He stopped on Wellingborough Road to refuel his car with petrol from a petrol canister. Melih Buyukerzurum was walking home from work when he saw Jordan Crowley standing against the car in a way that looked peculiar. He took a longer look which angered Crowley. Melih Buyukerzurum attempted to defuse the situation, however, Crowley knocked on the window of the car he was driving to get his passenger, who had a knife on him, to get out of the car. The other person then quickly slashed Melih Buyukerzurum's face with the knife. Conveying articles into prison On 6 January 2018, Smith went to HMP Bedford on the pretext of visiting a prisoner. The prison drugs dog alerted the staff to the possibility of drugs being present. Smith could not describe the prisoner he was visiting, he did not know his name and when challenged he told the officers that he had a package which he handed over. He said he had been paid £200 to bring it into the prison. The package contained 25.1 grammes of cannabis, 3.07 grammes of heroin and four mini mobile phones with USB leads. Material legislation The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment or, in the case of a person under the age of 21, custody for life. The sentencing court is required to set the minimum term which must be served before the offender can be considered for release on licence by the Parole Board, under section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (""the 2003 Act""). In setting that minimum term the court must have regard to the general principles set out in Schedule 21 to that Act: see section 269(5)(a). Paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 21 states: ""If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when he committed the offence, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years."" Paragraph 5(2) gives examples of cases which will normally fall into the category of ""particularly serious"". So far as material it states: ""(c) a murder done for gain (such as a murder done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary, done for payment or done in the expectation of gain as a result of the death)"". Paragraph 5A, which was inserted into Schedule 21 by way of amendment in 2010, states: ""(1) If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) or 5(1), (b) the offence falls within sub-paragraph (2), and (c) the offender was aged 18 or over when the offender committed the offence, the offence is normally to be regarded as sufficiently serious for the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, to be 25 years. (2) The offence falls within this sub-paragraph if the offender took a knife or other weapon to the scene intending to (a) commit any offence, or (b) have it available to use as a weapon, and used that knife or other weapon in committing the murder."" Paragraphs 8 and 9 of Schedule 21 state: ""8. Having chosen a starting point, the court should take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors, to the extent that it has not allowed for them in its choice of starting point. 9. Detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the making of a whole life order."" Paragraph 10 sets out a non-exhaustive list of aggravating factors. It is not suggested that any of the aggravating factors mentioned in paragraph 10 were present in this case. Finally, paragraph 11 states: ""Mitigating factors that may be relevant to the offence of murder include (a) an intention to cause serious bodily harm rather than to kill, (b) lack of premeditation, (g) the age of the offender."" Sentencing remarks The judge passed sentence on 1 November 2019. At that date Smith, Drage and Higgs were aged 20, having been 19 at the time of the murder. Crowley was aged 21, having been 20 at the time of the murder. Smith had two previous court appearances for three offences, including the possession of a knife in a public place. Drage had a previous court appearance for affray. Higgs had one previous conviction for possession of a knife in a public place. Crowley had 16 court appearances for 27 offences, including unlawful wounding. The judge did not require a pre-sentence report and we make it clear, having regard to the provisions of section 156 of the 2003 Act, that we do not consider one to be necessary now. The judge did have a psychiatric report from Dr S Thirumalai and a psychological report from John Cordwell. She also had a report from the intermediary who assisted Smith during the trial. The judge had before her Victim Personal Statements from Katie Little, the parents of the deceased and other members of his family. She also had Victim Personal Statements from the victims of the two attacks under section 18. She also had a Community Impact Statement from a Detective Chief Superintendent, which informed her of public concerns about knife crime in Northamptonshire. The judge had a difficult sentencing exercise to perform. This was not only because there were five offenders to be sentenced but also a number of different offences committed by each of them. Her sentencing remarks were thorough and careful. The main offence for which she had to sentence these four appellants was the offence of murder. She took the view that, in setting the minimum terms, the starting point had to be one of 30 years because the case fell within paragraph 5 of Schedule 21. She was well aware that she retained a discretion to determine the minimum term and that she should have regard to the principles set out in Schedule 21 but not to follow them rigidly. She found that there were no statutory aggravating features under paragraph 10 of Schedule 21. However, there were these non-statutory aggravating features: this was a group attack, the killing took place in the presence of Katie Little and there were two other people in the flat. (In fact, with Mr Porter, there would have been three other people.) She said that the statutory mitigating factors were the Appellants' ages and the absence of an intention to kill. The judge had regard to the relevant sentencing guidelines for the other offences, namely robbery in a dwelling, wounding with intent and possession of drugs with intent to supply. No complaint is made before us as to the sentences imposed for the other offences, which were made concurrent to the minimum terms for murder. In the case of Higgs the judge said: ""I do not conclude that you are a dangerous offender pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 2003."" She imposed a sentence, taking account of his guilty plea, of 12 years detention for the offence of conspiracy to rob. She imposed a sentence of custody for life with a minimum term of 28 years less the time spent on remand. In the case of Smith the judge took into account the medical reports before her and what she had been able to observe herself of him during the trial. She said: ""I am sure that you have a complex set of issues that meant you had significant interruptions to your education, were diagnosed in the past with ADHD, but have, nevertheless, embraced a violent, criminal lifestyle centred around drugs and gangs. You may be a follower rather than a leader but you are an enthusiastic follower, happy to use serious and lethal violence. The videos in which you feature demonstrate this very clearly."" She concluded that Smith was a dangerous offender. She imposed an extended sentence of 14 years detention in respect of the offence of wounding with intent, including a custodial period of 10 years and 9 months. For the offences of conveying articles into prison, she imposed concurrent terms of detention of 2 years for the heroin, 12 months for the cannabis and 16 months for the mobile phones, after taking into account his guilty pleas. For the offence of conspiracy to rob she imposed a sentence of 12 years detention after taking into account his guilty pleas. For the offence of murder she imposed a minimum term of 31 years less the time spent on remand. In the case of Crowley the judge concluded that he was a dangerous offender. He had embraced a violent, criminal lifestyle centred around drugs and gangs. In relation to the two offences of wounding with intent she imposed an extended sentence of 15 years imprisonment, including a custodial period of 11 years and 8 months. For the offence of conspiracy to rob, after giving a 25% discount for his plea, which had taken place at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing, she imposed a sentence of 11 years and 3 months. For the offence of murder she imposed a minimum term of 34 years less the time spent on remand. She made it clear that she kept in mind both the principle of totality and the fact that he was still only 21. In the case of Drage the judge activated the whole term of the suspended sentence for his previous offence of affray, to run concurrently to the life sentence. For the offence of conspiracy to rob, she gave credit of just over 10% because his plea had been entered on the first day of the trial. She imposed a sentence of 13 years and 6 months. For the offence of murder she imposed a minimum term of 28 years less the time spent on remand. In the case of each Appellant the judge specified the number of days (268 days) which had been spent on remand and were therefore to be deducted from the minimum terms imposed. Relevant principles to be derived from the authorities In R v Last and Others [2005] EWCA Crim 106 ; [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 64 , at para. 17, Lord Woolf CJ said that the provisions of Schedule 21 do not remove the sentencing judge's discretion. ""They merely indicate the matters to which the judge must have regard when exercising his discretion."" In addition, he continued: ""Schedule 21 does not seek to identify all the aggravating and mitigating factors, it merely provides relevant examples."" In R v Peters and Others [2005] EWCA Crim 605 ; [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 Judge LJ, the Deputy Chief Justice at that time, set out the approach to be applied when determining the minimum term in accordance with Schedule 21. It is unnecessary to restate all of those principles here but it is important to have them in mind. We draw out some of those principles for present purposes. First, the sentencing decision depends on the facts of each case and each defendant. It is not capable of arithmetical calculation: see para. 3. Secondly, the protection of the public, which is rightly regarded as the prime consideration, is achieved by the mandatory life sentence itself. This is because an offender cannot be released even after the expiry of the minimum term unless the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer presents a danger to the public. Accordingly, the minimum term is designed to serve the sentencing purposes of punishment and deterrence: see para. 4. Thirdly, ""justice cannot be done by rote"": see para. 5. Fourthly, the true seriousness of the offence, which the minimum term is intended to reflect, represents a combination and a balancing of all the relevant factors in the case, including aggravating and mitigating factors: see para. 8. Fifthly, in considering an appeal from the sentencing judge, this Court will not interfere unless, in all the circumstances, the minimum term is manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. ""If, looked at overall, this Court takes the view that the end result fell within the appropriate range of sentence and the margin of judgment and discretion given to the sentencing judge, nice points, whether or not based on a mathematical calculation, about whether he allowed sufficiently for this, or that specific feature of the case, will not result in a successful appeal"": see para. 9. Sixthly, the age of the offender is a relevant factor. At paras. 10-12 Judge LJ said: ""10. Schedule 21 includes repeated references to the age of the offender. Significant distinctions to the normal starting point are drawn between offenders who are aged 21 or over, 18 or over, or under 18 at the time of the offence. Thus, for example, for an offender aged 18 or over whose case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) or 5(1) or 5(2), the appropriate starting point is 15 years, but if he is aged under 18, the appropriate starting point becomes 12 years. And quite apart from different starting points directly related to age, there is a specific, additional, mitigating feature under paragraph 11(g), 'the age of the offender'. 11. It has long been understood that considerations of age and maturity are usually relevant to the culpability of an offender and the seriousness of the offence. Schedule 21 underlines this principle. Although the passage of an eighteenth or twenty-first birthday represents a significant moment in the life of each individual, it does not necessarily tell us very much about the individual's true level of maturity, insight and understanding. These levels are not postponed until nor suddenly accelerated by an eighteenth or twenty-first birthday. Therefore although the normal starting point is governed by the defendant's age, when assessing his culpability, the sentencing judge should reflect on and make allowances, as appropriate upwards or downwards, for the level of the offender's maturity. 12. The first stage in the process nevertheless remains the prescribed statutory starting point. This ensures consistency of approach, and appropriate adherence to the relevant legislative provisions. Schedule 21 does not envisage a moveable starting point, upwards or downwards, from the dates fixed by reference to the offender's eighteenth or twenty-first birthdays. Nor does it provide a mathematical scale, starting at 12 years for the eighteen year old offender, moving upwards to 13 years for the nineteen year old, through to 14 years for the twenty year old, culminating in 15 years for the twenty-one year old. The principle is simple. Where the offender's age, as it affects his culpability and the seriousness of the crime justifies it, a substantial, or even a very substantial discount, from the starting point may be appropriate. One way in which the judge may check that the discount is proportionate would be for him to consider it in the context of the overall statutory framework, as if Schedule 21 envisaged a flexible starting point for offenders between eighteen and twenty-one. This would have the advantage of linking the mitigation which would normally arise from the offender's relative youth with the statutory provisions which apply to an offender a year or two older, or younger, and would contribute to a desirable level of sentencing consistency. Due allowance should then be made for the relevant aggravating and mitigating features to produce the final determination of the minimum term, and thereafter the judge should explain the reasons for the determination in open court."" (Emphasis in original) Seventhly, the significance of there being an intention to cause really serious harm rather than to kill was considered by Judge LJ at paras. 13-14: ""13. Paragraph 11(a) of Schedule 21 identifies an intention to cause serious bodily harm rather than to kill as a potential mitigating factor. An intention to cause serious bodily harm is a sufficient intention for murder, and violence inflicted with such an intent remains an offence of the utmost seriousness requiring the mandatory life sentence in the same way as murder resulting from an intent to kill. It has however long been recognised that, all other features of the case being equal, the seriousness of a murder committed with intent to kill is normally more grave and serious than one committed with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Paragraph 11(a) gives effect to that common understanding. 14. That said, no specific distinction based on the offender's intent is made in any of the starting points under paragraphs 4 or 5(1) and (2), 6 and 7, and there is no specific or special starting point for cases where the offender intended really serious harm rather than death. Moreover paragraph 11(a) underlines that such an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, as opposed to an intention to kill, 'may' provide relevant mitigation, but not necessarily, and not always. Thus, murder committed with an intent to kill may attract yet greater mitigation than a killing to which paragraph 11(a) applies. For example, where the killing represents an act of mercy, motivated by love and devotion, as envisaged in paragraph 11(f), the intention is indeed to kill, to provide a merciful release. It is unlikely that the mitigation in such a case will be less than the mitigation allowed to an offender who involves himself in an unlawful violent incident and, intending to do really serious harm, causes death. Similarly, there are cases in which death, even if unintended, is a possible or likely consequence of the offender's premeditated conduct. For example, those who abduct a child intending to blackmail the parents into providing a large ransom may deliberately make the parents aware that the child is being tortured, to encourage a positive response from the parents. In the course of torture the child may die. Just because the very objective of the criminal is a ransom, death may not be intended. If it is a consequence of the abduction or torture, we doubt whether much, if any, allowance would normally be made in mitigation for the fact that the death of the child was an unintended consequence of the deliberate infliction of bodily harm."" In Attorney General's Reference Numbers 7 and 8 of 2006 ( Ellis and McAfee ) [2006] EWCA Crim 839; [2006] 2 Cr App R (S) 112, Lord Phillips CJ considered the interpretation of paragraph 5(2)(c) of Schedule 21. He made it clear, at paras. 24-25 that a murder will still be ""for gain"" if it is ""in the course of"" a burglary even if it was not ""in furtherance of"" it. The legislation uses both terms. Lord Phillips CJ said that a judge may be justified in taking into account that the murder was not premeditated, which is one of the mitigating factors expressly listed in paragraph 11 of Schedule 21. But the appropriate course then is to take the 30 year starting point and then to make ""substantial reductions from it"": see para. 25. We note in passing that, in the same paragraph, Lord Phillips CJ drew a distinction between a premeditated murder, which is deliberately carried out in order to further a burglary, and a murder which is an unplanned reaction to an unexpected confrontation in the course of a burglary. This is because that distinction was relevant on the facts of that case. There can be many situations in between those extremes. The present case provides an example, since the Appellants went equipped with various weapons in order to commit a robbery. Although it was not their intention to commit the murder they must have been aware that one or more weapons might be used depending on what happened in the course of the robbery. We also note that, at para. 28, Lord Phillips CJ confirmed what had been said in Peters , that the youth and immaturity of the offenders constituted ""significant mitigation"". In R v Bouhaddaou [2006] EWCA Crim 3190; [2007] 2 Cr App R (S) 23, Lord Phillips CJ again considered the meaning of a murder ""for gain"" in paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 21. An argument similar to the one made in the present case on behalf of Higgs was made in that case at para. 11. The argument was that a murder will only be committed for gain if it is committed in order to facilitate the gain. In that case the offender had stabbed his victim in order to facilitate his escape from the house, having been caught red-handed in the act of burglary. This Court held that that was ""sophistry"": see para. 15. Lord Phillips CJ said that escaping after a burglary is an integral element of the criminal enterprise and, if murder is committed to facilitate escape from a burglary whose object is gain, then it can properly be said to be committed ""for gain"". If there were any doubt about that it would be removed by the contrast between the words ""in the course of"" and ""in furtherance of"" which the draftsman had used. At para. 18 Lord Phillips observed that the ""huge gulf"" between a starting point of 15 years and one of 30 years poses a considerable problem for sentencers. Depending upon the particular facts, sentences for murder should cover all parts of the area between those two starting points. This means that it may be appropriate to move a long way from the starting point to reflect aggravation or mitigation. At para. 19, Lord Phillips said that, whatever the starting point, an intention to kill is assumed within that starting point. The absence of an intention to kill ""is an important mitigating factor"" and is likely to go hand in hand with the absence of premeditation. We note, however, the following passage in para. 19: ""There is a significant difference between a criminal who sets out to use violence, although not intending to kill, to achieve his criminal end and the criminal who uses violence without setting out to do so, when unexpectedly caught in the act of the crime."" Again, we would observe that Lord Phillips was not seeking to set out all the possible permutations and his judgment should not be read as if it were a statute. In the present case, the Appellants may not have intended to kill but they were not simply caught in the act of a burglary. They went equipped with weapons so that they could be used if necessary in the course of a robbery. In R v De Silva [2014] EWCA Crim 2616 ; [2015] 1 Cr App R (S) 52, this Court reduced the minimum term of 32 years to one of 28 years in circumstances where the offender was 19 years old and, upon being confronted by the elderly home owner in the course of a burglary, stabbed him 22 times with a knife brought to the scene. Each case must turn on its own facts but we note that the appellant's age was regarded by this Court as a significant mitigating factor. At para. 10, Blake J observed that: ""young offenders are more likely to be impulsive, unthinking, and respond to situations with excessive and gratuitous force."" The Court considered that a minimum term of 32 years for a young man who killed when he was aged 19 was ""a very severe sentence, and perhaps uniquely so."" In Attorney General's Reference (Clarke) [2018] EWCA Crim 185 ; [2018] 1 Cr App R (S) 52 , which was not a murder case, at para. 5 Lord Burnett CJ said: ""Reaching the age of 18 has many legal consequences, but it does not present a cliff edge for the purposes of sentencing. So much has long been clear. The discussion in R v Peters [2005] EWCA Crim 605 , [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 is an example of its application: see paras [10]-[12]. Full maturity and all the attributes of adulthood are not magically conferred on young people on their 18 th birthdays. Experience of life reflected in scientific research (e.g. The Age of Adolescence: thelancet.com/child-adolescent; 17 January 2018) is that young people continue to mature, albeit at different rates, for some time beyond their 18 th birthdays. The youth and maturity of an offender will be factors that inform any sentencing decision, even if an offender has passed his or her 18 th birthday. The ages of these offenders illustrate the point. "" We invited submissions from the parties about the decision of this Court in R v Hummerstone [2014] EWCA Crim 670, in which the judgment was given by Treacy LJ. Although every case turns on its own facts that case did have some similarities to the present case. The appellant was aged 18 at the time of the offences. His previous criminal record was a relatively insignificant one. He was convicted of murder. He also had to be sentenced for a number of other offences, including aggravated burglary and wounding with intent. The minimum term imposed of 26 years was upheld on appeal as being not manifestly excessive. The appellant had gone with his co-defendant, to the flat of the deceased, where he lived with his partner and three very young children. The co-defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary but acquitted of murder and wounding with intent. The plan was to rob the deceased of drugs and money. There was no intention to kill. On behalf of the appellant counsel submitted that not every case in which a murder is committed in the course of a robbery is necessarily ""particularly serious"" because paragraph 5 of Schedule 21 uses the word ""normally"". He submitted that the appropriate starting point should have been 25 years, in accordance with paragraph 5A, because a knife had been taken to the scene. The Court rejected that submission and said, at para. 19: ""It is clear to us that the whole picture of events must be taken into account in assessing whether the seriousness of this case was particularly high. The offence of murder is not to be viewed in isolation but alongside the other offences on the indictment which form part of the overall picture. The facts show a planned aggravated burglary carried out by two men. The originator of the offence was this appellant. He described himself as the 'team captain' during his evidence at trial. The two men forced their way into the victim's flat in the small hours of the morning. They knew the premises were occupied. They were disguised. This appellant had bought the imitation firearm for this very purpose the day before the offence. The accomplice held that weapon. The appellant was brandishing the large chopping knife. The purpose of the break-in was to rob those inside of money and drugs which the robbers believed they would find."" The Court considered the absence of premeditation at para. 21, where it said the following: ""It is clear to us, firstly, that this offence, being a murder committed in the course or furtherance of a robbery or burglary, is one which in the circumstances comes fully within paragraph 5(1). It is not a necessary pre-condition that the killer should at the outset have intended to murder the victim in order to facilitate the commission of the offence of robbery or burglary. Whilst the killing may not have been premeditated in the sense that there was an intention necessarily to kill or do really serious bodily harm prior to entering into the premises, the nature of the attack shows a degree of persistence, and as this court has previously observed in relation to knife crime, every knife carried represents a danger since the consequences of carrying a weapon of that sort are foreseeably serious and extend to murder. We therefore do not consider that the mitigating factor in relation to premeditation carries particular weight in this case."" The Court considered the absence of an intention to kill at para. 22, where it said the following: ""Turning to the absence of an intention to kill, that plainly is a mitigating factor, but, as was observed in R v Peters and others [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 , it cannot be assumed that the absence of an intention to kill necessarily provides very much mitigation. Where a weapon is taken and used and is of a sort which is liable to cause death, the mitigation on this ground is reduced. Thus, when consideration is given to the two factors relied on by the appellant in challenging the starting point, we consider that the case was indeed properly assessed as having a 30 year starting point since the aggravating factors we have earlier identified are of considerable gravity and greatly outweigh the mitigating factors relied on. We do not consider that the judge was wrong. In our judgment, this case properly fell into the category of one involving particularly high seriousness when it is looked at in the round."" At para. 26 the Court expressed the view that an older offender would have attracted a starting point somewhat in excess of the initial 30 year point. Allowance for the mitigation available to the appellant would have reduced that to 30 years but from that figure the judge would then have to make further allowance for the youth of the appellant. In the circumstances of that case, the Court concluded that a reduction of four years to reflect that consideration of age was within the range of reasonable allowance afforded to the sentencing judge. For that reason the minimum term of 26 years was not manifestly excessive. Analysis We will address first a submission which was advanced only by Mr Campbell-Tiech QC on behalf of Higgs. He submits that the judge took the wrong starting point, of 30 years, and should have taken the starting point of 25 years on the basis that this case was properly to be regarded as falling within paragraph 5A of Schedule 21 rather than paragraph 5. Mr Campbell-Tiech reminds this Court that the ""general principles"" set out in Schedule 21 are not prescriptive. Ultimately, he submits, the question which a sentencing judge must ask is ""what is the appropriate starting point which fairly reflects the facts of the particular case?"" Is the seriousness of the murder ""particularly high""?"" He also submits that the structure of Schedule 21 shows that there can be overlapping categories, which necessitates such a judgement having to be formed. For example, paragraph 5(2)(h) refers back to paragraph 4(2). It is clear from those provisions that there can be cases in which, because a person is under the age of 21, a case which would otherwise be in the ""exceptionally high"" category of paragraph 4, and would therefore justify a whole life order, may mean that a 30 year starting point is appropriate. Mr Campbell-Tiech also submits that unlike other cases which the Courts have considered, for example Hummerstone , in this case the criminal enterprise of robbery was brought to an end once the deceased was subjected to the violent attack upon him. He submits that this cannot be said to be properly a murder done ""for gain"". Nor is it a case where the murder was committed in escaping from a burglary or robbery, as was the case on the facts of Bouhaddaou . We do not accept those submissions. In our view, it is clear that this case squarely fell within the terms of paragraph 5, even if it might otherwise have fallen into paragraph 5A. It is quite true that the categories in Schedule 21 are not hermetically sealed. But that does not mean that the judge was not entitled to place this case within paragraph 5. Furthermore, we accept the submission on behalf of the Respondent that it would be unduly artificial to try to separate different elements of what happened in what was inevitably a fast-moving scene. The criminal enterprise did not come to an abrupt end once the attack on the victim which led to his death began. It is also clear, on authority and on the wording of paragraph 5, that a murder ""for gain"" does not necessarily mean that it was committed with the expectation of gain. It will suffice if it is committed ""in the course of"" a robbery or burglary. This is also underlined by the fact that that phrase can be contrasted with what immediately follows, ""in furtherance of"". We next address a submission that was made in particular on behalf of Smith by Mr House QC. He submits that the judge was wrong to say that there were two non-statutory aggravating features in the present case. Those two features were that this was a group attack and that there were other persons present in the flat when the attack occurred, including the victim's girlfriend, Katie Little. Mr House submits that these were not unusual features and will often be found in cases of this kind. He submits that Parliament has effectively subsumed these features when setting the 30 year starting point in para. 5. We disagree. Although they may well be found in many such cases, the fact remains that Parliament has thought it right in enacting paragraph 5 to say that a case may be particularly serious even where these features are not present. In such a case the 30 year starting point would still be applicable. In our view, if anything, the judge would have been entitled to go further. In our view, the aggravating circumstances of this case were not simply as she described them but they also included the fact that Ms Little was physically prevented from going to the assistance of the deceased as he was being attacked in their home. She herself was injured in the process. There were submissions made before this Court on behalf of Higgs and Smith in particular to the effect that there were material differences between the appellants, for example as to the role which each had played. We consider that the judge was entitled, particularly having heard the evidence at the trial, to conclude that there was no material distinction to be drawn between the four of them. On behalf of Higgs it was submitted that the judge failed to have regard to the fact that she had concluded that he was not a dangerous offender, unlike the other appellants. We reject that submission. She clearly had that in mind, as she had mentioned it in her sentencing remarks. It was, however, of no material significance when it came to the determination of the minimum term, since the aim of protection of the public is, as Judge LJ said in Peters , already built into the fact that Parliament has thought it right to require a mandatory life sentence for the offence of murder. This has the consequence that the purposes of the minimum term are punishment and deterrence. We also consider that the judge was entitled to come to the view that there was nothing in the medical reports before her about Smith which should lead to a distinction being made between him and the others. We have read those reports and do not consider that anything in them required her to take a different view. We also bear in mind that, as the trial judge, she would have been familiar with Smith's ability to follow the proceedings. He was not unfit to plead or be tried. He did need the assistance of an intermediary but that did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that his culpability was materially reduced in relation to his offences. Mr House was at pains to emphasise before us that the judge had changed her mind about whether the intermediary should sit with Smith during the trial rather than outside the dock but, in our view, this reinforces the point that she was well placed to assess whether and to what extent this had any material bearing on his culpability for his offences. Accordingly, we have reached the conclusion that, in the circumstances of this case, the judge would have been entitled to go above 30 years before taking into account mitigation. As we have already emphasised, the exercise cannot be conducted in an arithmetical way. What is called for is judgement. The crux of the arguments on behalf of all four appellants is that the judge gave insufficient regard to three features of the case which were present in respect of each of them: (1) Their relatively young ages. (2) The lack of an intention to kill. (3) The lack of premeditation. In our view, the third of those features adds nothing material on the facts of the present case to the second. As we have said earlier, the judge undoubtedly had a difficult sentencing exercise to perform. We commend the thorough way in which she approached her task. In our view, the crucial point is the one which is common to all of these appellants: it is whether the judge at the end of the day gave sufficient weight to both the ages of the appellants and to the fact that she had found that they did not have an intention to kill. We have come to the conclusion that, with respect, she did not give sufficient weight to those two features of this case. In our view, those factors, when taken together, should have led to a minimum term in the case of Higgs and Drage of 26 years rather than 28 years. It is clear from the reasoning of the judge that she carefully sentenced in respect of the other offences for which she had to sentence Smith and Crowley. No complaint was made before this Court about the correctness of those sentences. It follows that the minimum terms in their cases had to be higher than those for Higgs and Drage, particularly bearing in mind the principle of totality and that the other sentences would be concurrent. Applying the thinking of the judge therefore we have come to the conclusion that the appropriate minimum term in the case of Smith should have been one of 29 years rather than 31 years and the minimum term in the case of Crowley should have been one of 32 years rather than 34 years. In each case the number of days spent on remand (268 days) must be deducted from those minimum terms. We have come to the conclusion that, despite the careful way in which the judge approached her task, at the end of the day the minimum terms imposed in these cases were manifestly excessive. They will be reduced in accordance with paras. 78-79 above. To that extent these appeals are allowed. Before we conclude we would like to thank all counsel for their written and oral submissions.

Lord Justice Singh : Introduction These are four related appeals against sentence brought with the leave of the single judge. The appellants were sentenced by HHJ Lucking QC at the Crown Court at Northampton on 1 November 2019. All four appellants were sentenced for conspiracy to rob, to which they pleaded guilty, and the murder of Reece Ottaway on 1 February 2019, of which they were convicted by the jury after a trial. There was an additional co-defendant by the name of Ethan Sterling, who was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery and the lesser offence of manslaughter. He plays no part in these appeals. Two of the appellants were sentenced for other offences, concurrently with the life sentences for murder. There were two offences of wounding with intent, contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. On 3 October 2018, Adison Smith and Jordan Crowley (also known as Kimpton) inflicted an attack on Christian Fearon. They pleaded guilty to that offence. On 4 October 2018, Crowley was also involved in an attack on Melih Buyukerzurum. He pleaded guilty to that offence also. In addition, Smith pleaded guilty to three counts of conveying articles into prison on 6 January 2018. Again the sentences for those offences were made concurrent to the life sentence for murder. These appeals are in substance against the length of the minimum terms which were imposed for the offence of murder. Cameron Higgs and Alfie Drage received minimum terms of 28 years each. Smith received a minimum term of 31 years and Crowley received one of 34 years. In each case the judge specified the number of days (268 days) which were to be deducted to reflect time spent on remand. The facts Conspiracy to rob and murder The deceased was Reece Ottaway. He was aged 23 when he was murdered. He was known to the appellants as a drug dealer, mainly dealing in cannabis. The deceased lived in Cordwainer House, Northampton, in a one bedroom flat rented by his friend Zak Shortland. On the morning of the murder, the deceased was sleeping with his girlfriend Katie Little, on a mattress in the living room. In total, there were five people sleeping in the flat: the deceased, Katie Little, Zak Shortland, Lucas Porter and Aiden Britten. During the days preceding the murder, the four appellants came up with a plan to rob the deceased of both money and drugs. The deceased had sent a message to Jordan Crowley stating that he had reloaded his stock of drugs and they also believed he had £30,000 in cash in the flat. On the morning of 1 February 2019, the four appellants and Sterling drove across Northampton arriving at Cordwainer House at approximately 1:15 am. The group forced their way into the flat, armed in preparation for the robbery with a machete, other types of large knives and a BB gun. Katie Little awoke to the noise of the men entering the flat and saw that two men were armed with a large knife and a gun. The deceased got out of bed and was immediately surrounded by them. He was threatened with the BB gun and repeatedly stabbed. One of the group struck Katie Little in her face with the knife, cutting her ear. When the five departed, the deceased was slumped in a chair gasping for breath. It was a short and brutal attack. Zak Shortland and Aiden Bitten had barricaded themselves in the bedroom and did not come out until after the appellants and Sterling had left. They went to the aid of the deceased who was bleeding heavily but the stab wounds inflicted led to his death at the scene. The post mortem also revealed a single tramline bruise to the right buttock that suggested a blow from a rod shaped object - the baseball bat. The deceased's iPhone and some cash around £20 was stolen by one of the appellants. The appellants left in Ethan Sterling's car. CCTV captured Sterling dropping off Crowley and Smith at around 1:36 am. Adison Smith had a noticeable limp, an injury sustained during the attack. Drage and Higgs made their way back to different addresses. Wounding with intent On 3 October 2018, Christian Fearon was outside the Elders Arms pub in Great Billing. He and two friends had stepped outside the pub in order to smoke a cigarette. As they were sitting on a bench a little way down from the pub, a car containing the appellants, Smith and Crowley, pulled up alongside them. Three other men were also in the car, Gavin Munroe, Sonny Stewart and Tyler Metcalfe. The front passenger window of the car was wound down and one of the group, not Smith or Crowley, asked Christian Fearon and his friends whether they were part of ""F 36"", a Northampton gang. Christian Fearon and his friends replied ""no"". The car pulled 100 yards or so down the road. All five got out of the car and walked back to where Christian Fearon and his friends were sitting. They had masks or scarves across their faces. Christian Fearon became separated from his two friends. Whilst Gavin Munro, Sonny Stewart and Tyler Metcalfe stayed back with Christian Fearon's two friends, Smith and Crowley approached Christian Fearon. He repeated to them that he was not part of F 36 and that he had done nothing wrong and tried to calm them down. He turned around and made to run away. As he did so he felt blows to both of his arms and to his back, he had been stabbed three times. The five ran down the street chasing Christian Fearon's two friends before they got back into the car and drove to an area in Blackthorn; Blackthorn being the heart of F 36 territory. They stopped outside the Blackthorn One Stop shop and took a celebratory photograph. It is apparent from videos recorded on that evening that this group of men were driving around Northampton looking for members of F 36 to inflict harm on them. In these videos the men identify themselves variously as 04, or D Block; D Block being a reference to the Duston area of Northampton. Videos taken before the attack show Smith in possession of a machete. By about 5:00 am the following morning of 4 October 2018, Crowley was travelling in the same car with another. He stopped on Wellingborough Road to refuel his car with petrol from a petrol canister. Melih Buyukerzurum was walking home from work when he saw Jordan Crowley standing against the car in a way that looked peculiar. He took a longer look which angered Crowley. Melih Buyukerzurum attempted to defuse the situation, however, Crowley knocked on the window of the car he was driving to get his passenger, who had a knife on him, to get out of the car. The other person then quickly slashed Melih Buyukerzurum's face with the knife. Conveying articles into prison On 6 January 2018, Smith went to HMP Bedford on the pretext of visiting a prisoner. The prison drugs dog alerted the staff to the possibility of drugs being present. Smith could not describe the prisoner he was visiting, he did not know his name and when challenged he told the officers that he had a package which he handed over. He said he had been paid £200 to bring it into the prison. The package contained 25.1 grammes of cannabis, 3.07 grammes of heroin and four mini mobile phones with USB leads. Material legislation The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment or, in the case of a person under the age of 21, custody for life. The sentencing court is required to set the minimum term which must be served before the offender can be considered for release on licence by the Parole Board, under section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (""the 2003 Act""). In setting that minimum term the court must have regard to the general principles set out in Schedule 21 to that Act: see section 269(5)(a). Paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 21 states: ""If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence (or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it) is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when he committed the offence, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years."" Paragraph 5(2) gives examples of cases which will normally fall into the category of ""particularly serious"". So far as material it states: ""(c) a murder done for gain (such as a murder done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary, done for payment or done in the expectation of gain as a result of the death)"". Paragraph 5A, which was inserted into Schedule 21 by way of amendment in 2010, states: ""(1) If (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) or 5(1), (b) the offence falls within sub-paragraph (2), and (c) the offender was aged 18 or over when the offender committed the offence, the offence is normally to be regarded as sufficiently serious for the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, to be 25 years. (2) The offence falls within this sub-paragraph if the offender took a knife or other weapon to the scene intending to (a) commit any offence, or (b) have it available to use as a weapon, and used that knife or other weapon in committing the murder."" Paragraphs 8 and 9 of Schedule 21 state: ""8. Having chosen a starting point, the court should take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors, to the extent that it has not allowed for them in its choice of starting point. 9. Detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the making of a whole life order."" Paragraph 10 sets out a non-exhaustive list of aggravating factors. It is not suggested that any of the aggravating factors mentioned in paragraph 10 were present in this case. Finally, paragraph 11 states: ""Mitigating factors that may be relevant to the offence of murder include (a) an intention to cause serious bodily harm rather than to kill, (b) lack of premeditation, (g) the age of the offender."" Sentencing remarks The judge passed sentence on 1 November 2019. At that date Smith, Drage and Higgs were aged 20, having been 19 at the time of the murder. Crowley was aged 21, having been 20 at the time of the murder. Smith had two previous court appearances for three offences, including the possession of a knife in a public place. Drage had a previous court appearance for affray. Higgs had one previous conviction for possession of a knife in a public place. Crowley had 16 court appearances for 27 offences, including unlawful wounding. The judge did not require a pre-sentence report and we make it clear, having regard to the provisions of section 156 of the 2003 Act, that we do not consider one to be necessary now. The judge did have a psychiatric report from Dr S Thirumalai and a psychological report from John Cordwell. She also had a report from the intermediary who assisted Smith during the trial. The judge had before her Victim Personal Statements from Katie Little, the parents of the deceased and other members of his family. She also had Victim Personal Statements from the victims of the two attacks under section 18. She also had a Community Impact Statement from a Detective Chief Superintendent, which informed her of public concerns about knife crime in Northamptonshire. The judge had a difficult sentencing exercise to perform. This was not only because there were five offenders to be sentenced but also a number of different offences committed by each of them. Her sentencing remarks were thorough and careful. The main offence for which she had to sentence these four appellants was the offence of murder. She took the view that, in setting the minimum terms, the starting point had to be one of 30 years because the case fell within paragraph 5 of Schedule 21. She was well aware that she retained a discretion to determine the minimum term and that she should have regard to the principles set out in Schedule 21 but not to follow them rigidly. She found that there were no statutory aggravating features under paragraph 10 of Schedule 21. However, there were these non-statutory aggravating features: this was a group attack, the killing took place in the presence of Katie Little and there were two other people in the flat. (In fact, with Mr Porter, there would have been three other people.) She said that the statutory mitigating factors were the Appellants' ages and the absence of an intention to kill. The judge had regard to the relevant sentencing guidelines for the other offences, namely robbery in a dwelling, wounding with intent and possession of drugs with intent to supply. No complaint is made before us as to the sentences imposed for the other offences, which were made concurrent to the minimum terms for murder. In the case of Higgs the judge said: ""I do not conclude that you are a dangerous offender pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 2003."" She imposed a sentence, taking account of his guilty plea, of 12 years detention for the offence of conspiracy to rob. She imposed a sentence of custody for life with a minimum term of 28 years less the time spent on remand. In the case of Smith the judge took into account the medical reports before her and what she had been able to observe herself of him during the trial. She said: ""I am sure that you have a complex set of issues that meant you had significant interruptions to your education, were diagnosed in the past with ADHD, but have, nevertheless, embraced a violent, criminal lifestyle centred around drugs and gangs. You may be a follower rather than a leader but you are an enthusiastic follower, happy to use serious and lethal violence. The videos in which you feature demonstrate this very clearly."" She concluded that Smith was a dangerous offender. She imposed an extended sentence of 14 years detention in respect of the offence of wounding with intent, including a custodial period of 10 years and 9 months. For the offences of conveying articles into prison, she imposed concurrent terms of detention of 2 years for the heroin, 12 months for the cannabis and 16 months for the mobile phones, after taking into account his guilty pleas. For the offence of conspiracy to rob she imposed a sentence of 12 years detention after taking into account his guilty pleas. For the offence of murder she imposed a minimum term of 31 years less the time spent on remand. In the case of Crowley the judge concluded that he was a dangerous offender. He had embraced a violent, criminal lifestyle centred around drugs and gangs. In relation to the two offences of wounding with intent she imposed an extended sentence of 15 years imprisonment, including a custodial period of 11 years and 8 months. For the offence of conspiracy to rob, after giving a 25% discount for his plea, which had taken place at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing, she imposed a sentence of 11 years and 3 months. For the offence of murder she imposed a minimum term of 34 years less the time spent on remand. She made it clear that she kept in mind both the principle of totality and the fact that he was still only 21. In the case of Drage the judge activated the whole term of the suspended sentence for his previous offence of affray, to run concurrently to the life sentence. For the offence of conspiracy to rob, she gave credit of just over 10% because his plea had been entered on the first day of the trial. She imposed a sentence of 13 years and 6 months. For the offence of murder she imposed a minimum term of 28 years less the time spent on remand. In the case of each Appellant the judge specified the number of days (268 days) which had been spent on remand and were therefore to be deducted from the minimum terms imposed. Relevant principles to be derived from the authorities In R v Last and Others [2005] EWCA Crim 106 ; [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 64 , at para. 17, Lord Woolf CJ said that the provisions of Schedule 21 do not remove the sentencing judge's discretion. ""They merely indicate the matters to which the judge must have regard when exercising his discretion."" In addition, he continued: ""Schedule 21 does not seek to identify all the aggravating and mitigating factors, it merely provides relevant examples."" In R v Peters and Others [2005] EWCA Crim 605 ; [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 Judge LJ, the Deputy Chief Justice at that time, set out the approach to be applied when determining the minimum term in accordance with Schedule 21. It is unnecessary to restate all of those principles here but it is important to have them in mind. We draw out some of those principles for present purposes. First, the sentencing decision depends on the facts of each case and each defendant. It is not capable of arithmetical calculation: see para. 3. Secondly, the protection of the public, which is rightly regarded as the prime consideration, is achieved by the mandatory life sentence itself. This is because an offender cannot be released even after the expiry of the minimum term unless the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer presents a danger to the public. Accordingly, the minimum term is designed to serve the sentencing purposes of punishment and deterrence: see para. 4. Thirdly, ""justice cannot be done by rote"": see para. 5. Fourthly, the true seriousness of the offence, which the minimum term is intended to reflect, represents a combination and a balancing of all the relevant factors in the case, including aggravating and mitigating factors: see para. 8. Fifthly, in considering an appeal from the sentencing judge, this Court will not interfere unless, in all the circumstances, the minimum term is manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. ""If, looked at overall, this Court takes the view that the end result fell within the appropriate range of sentence and the margin of judgment and discretion given to the sentencing judge, nice points, whether or not based on a mathematical calculation, about whether he allowed sufficiently for this, or that specific feature of the case, will not result in a successful appeal"": see para. 9. Sixthly, the age of the offender is a relevant factor. At paras. 10-12 Judge LJ said: ""10. Schedule 21 includes repeated references to the age of the offender. Significant distinctions to the normal starting point are drawn between offenders who are aged 21 or over, 18 or over, or under 18 at the time of the offence. Thus, for example, for an offender aged 18 or over whose case does not fall within paragraph 4(1) or 5(1) or 5(2), the appropriate starting point is 15 years, but if he is aged under 18, the appropriate starting point becomes 12 years. And quite apart from different starting points directly related to age, there is a specific, additional, mitigating feature under paragraph 11(g), 'the age of the offender'. 11. It has long been understood that considerations of age and maturity are usually relevant to the culpability of an offender and the seriousness of the offence. Schedule 21 underlines this principle. Although the passage of an eighteenth or twenty-first birthday represents a significant moment in the life of each individual, it does not necessarily tell us very much about the individual's true level of maturity, insight and understanding. These levels are not postponed until nor suddenly accelerated by an eighteenth or twenty-first birthday. Therefore although the normal starting point is governed by the defendant's age, when assessing his culpability, the sentencing judge should reflect on and make allowances, as appropriate upwards or downwards, for the level of the offender's maturity. 12. The first stage in the process nevertheless remains the prescribed statutory starting point. This ensures consistency of approach, and appropriate adherence to the relevant legislative provisions. Schedule 21 does not envisage a moveable starting point, upwards or downwards, from the dates fixed by reference to the offender's eighteenth or twenty-first birthdays. Nor does it provide a mathematical scale, starting at 12 years for the eighteen year old offender, moving upwards to 13 years for the nineteen year old, through to 14 years for the twenty year old, culminating in 15 years for the twenty-one year old. The principle is simple. Where the offender's age, as it affects his culpability and the seriousness of the crime justifies it, a substantial, or even a very substantial discount, from the starting point may be appropriate. One way in which the judge may check that the discount is proportionate would be for him to consider it in the context of the overall statutory framework, as if Schedule 21 envisaged a flexible starting point for offenders between eighteen and twenty-one. This would have the advantage of linking the mitigation which would normally arise from the offender's relative youth with the statutory provisions which apply to an offender a year or two older, or younger, and would contribute to a desirable level of sentencing consistency. Due allowance should then be made for the relevant aggravating and mitigating features to produce the final determination of the minimum term, and thereafter the judge should explain the reasons for the determination in open court."" (Emphasis in original) Seventhly, the significance of there being an intention to cause really serious harm rather than to kill was considered by Judge LJ at paras. 13-14: ""13. Paragraph 11(a) of Schedule 21 identifies an intention to cause serious bodily harm rather than to kill as a potential mitigating factor. An intention to cause serious bodily harm is a sufficient intention for murder, and violence inflicted with such an intent remains an offence of the utmost seriousness requiring the mandatory life sentence in the same way as murder resulting from an intent to kill. It has however long been recognised that, all other features of the case being equal, the seriousness of a murder committed with intent to kill is normally more grave and serious than one committed with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Paragraph 11(a) gives effect to that common understanding. 14. That said, no specific distinction based on the offender's intent is made in any of the starting points under paragraphs 4 or 5(1) and (2), 6 and 7, and there is no specific or special starting point for cases where the offender intended really serious harm rather than death. Moreover paragraph 11(a) underlines that such an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, as opposed to an intention to kill, 'may' provide relevant mitigation, but not necessarily, and not always. Thus, murder committed with an intent to kill may attract yet greater mitigation than a killing to which paragraph 11(a) applies. For example, where the killing represents an act of mercy, motivated by love and devotion, as envisaged in paragraph 11(f), the intention is indeed to kill, to provide a merciful release. It is unlikely that the mitigation in such a case will be less than the mitigation allowed to an offender who involves himself in an unlawful violent incident and, intending to do really serious harm, causes death. Similarly, there are cases in which death, even if unintended, is a possible or likely consequence of the offender's premeditated conduct. For example, those who abduct a child intending to blackmail the parents into providing a large ransom may deliberately make the parents aware that the child is being tortured, to encourage a positive response from the parents. In the course of torture the child may die. Just because the very objective of the criminal is a ransom, death may not be intended. If it is a consequence of the abduction or torture, we doubt whether much, if any, allowance would normally be made in mitigation for the fact that the death of the child was an unintended consequence of the deliberate infliction of bodily harm."" In Attorney General's Reference Numbers 7 and 8 of 2006 ( Ellis and McAfee ) [2006] EWCA Crim 839; [2006] 2 Cr App R (S) 112, Lord Phillips CJ considered the interpretation of paragraph 5(2)(c) of Schedule 21. He made it clear, at paras. 24-25 that a murder will still be ""for gain"" if it is ""in the course of"" a burglary even if it was not ""in furtherance of"" it. The legislation uses both terms. Lord Phillips CJ said that a judge may be justified in taking into account that the murder was not premeditated, which is one of the mitigating factors expressly listed in paragraph 11 of Schedule 21. But the appropriate course then is to take the 30 year starting point and then to make ""substantial reductions from it"": see para. 25. We note in passing that, in the same paragraph, Lord Phillips CJ drew a distinction between a premeditated murder, which is deliberately carried out in order to further a burglary, and a murder which is an unplanned reaction to an unexpected confrontation in the course of a burglary. This is because that distinction was relevant on the facts of that case. There can be many situations in between those extremes. The present case provides an example, since the Appellants went equipped with various weapons in order to commit a robbery. Although it was not their intention to commit the murder they must have been aware that one or more weapons might be used depending on what happened in the course of the robbery. We also note that, at para. 28, Lord Phillips CJ confirmed what had been said in Peters , that the youth and immaturity of the offenders constituted ""significant mitigation"". In R v Bouhaddaou [2006] EWCA Crim 3190; [2007] 2 Cr App R (S) 23, Lord Phillips CJ again considered the meaning of a murder ""for gain"" in paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 21. An argument similar to the one made in the present case on behalf of Higgs was made in that case at para. 11. The argument was that a murder will only be committed for gain if it is committed in order to facilitate the gain. In that case the offender had stabbed his victim in order to facilitate his escape from the house, having been caught red-handed in the act of burglary. This Court held that that was ""sophistry"": see para. 15. Lord Phillips CJ said that escaping after a burglary is an integral element of the criminal enterprise and, if murder is committed to facilitate escape from a burglary whose object is gain, then it can properly be said to be committed ""for gain"". If there were any doubt about that it would be removed by the contrast between the words ""in the course of"" and ""in furtherance of"" which the draftsman had used. At para. 18 Lord Phillips observed that the ""huge gulf"" between a starting point of 15 years and one of 30 years poses a considerable problem for sentencers. Depending upon the particular facts, sentences for murder should cover all parts of the area between those two starting points. This means that it may be appropriate to move a long way from the starting point to reflect aggravation or mitigation. At para. 19, Lord Phillips said that, whatever the starting point, an intention to kill is assumed within that starting point. The absence of an intention to kill ""is an important mitigating factor"" and is likely to go hand in hand with the absence of premeditation. We note, however, the following passage in para. 19: ""There is a significant difference between a criminal who sets out to use violence, although not intending to kill, to achieve his criminal end and the criminal who uses violence without setting out to do so, when unexpectedly caught in the act of the crime."" Again, we would observe that Lord Phillips was not seeking to set out all the possible permutations and his judgment should not be read as if it were a statute. In the present case, the Appellants may not have intended to kill but they were not simply caught in the act of a burglary. They went equipped with weapons so that they could be used if necessary in the course of a robbery. In R v De Silva [2014] EWCA Crim 2616 ; [2015] 1 Cr App R (S) 52, this Court reduced the minimum term of 32 years to one of 28 years in circumstances where the offender was 19 years old and, upon being confronted by the elderly home owner in the course of a burglary, stabbed him 22 times with a knife brought to the scene. Each case must turn on its own facts but we note that the appellant's age was regarded by this Court as a significant mitigating factor. At para. 10, Blake J observed that: ""young offenders are more likely to be impulsive, unthinking, and respond to situations with excessive and gratuitous force."" The Court considered that a minimum term of 32 years for a young man who killed when he was aged 19 was ""a very severe sentence, and perhaps uniquely so."" In Attorney General's Reference (Clarke) [2018] EWCA Crim 185 ; [2018] 1 Cr App R (S) 52 , which was not a murder case, at para. 5 Lord Burnett CJ said: ""Reaching the age of 18 has many legal consequences, but it does not present a cliff edge for the purposes of sentencing. So much has long been clear. The discussion in R v Peters [2005] EWCA Crim 605 , [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 is an example of its application: see paras [10]-[12]. Full maturity and all the attributes of adulthood are not magically conferred on young people on their 18 th birthdays. Experience of life reflected in scientific research (e.g. The Age of Adolescence: thelancet.com/child-adolescent; 17 January 2018) is that young people continue to mature, albeit at different rates, for some time beyond their 18 th birthdays. The youth and maturity of an offender will be factors that inform any sentencing decision, even if an offender has passed his or her 18 th birthday. The ages of these offenders illustrate the point. "" We invited submissions from the parties about the decision of this Court in R v Hummerstone [2014] EWCA Crim 670, in which the judgment was given by Treacy LJ. Although every case turns on its own facts that case did have some similarities to the present case. The appellant was aged 18 at the time of the offences. His previous criminal record was a relatively insignificant one. He was convicted of murder. He also had to be sentenced for a number of other offences, including aggravated burglary and wounding with intent. The minimum term imposed of 26 years was upheld on appeal as being not manifestly excessive. The appellant had gone with his co-defendant, to the flat of the deceased, where he lived with his partner and three very young children. The co-defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary but acquitted of murder and wounding with intent. The plan was to rob the deceased of drugs and money. There was no intention to kill. On behalf of the appellant counsel submitted that not every case in which a murder is committed in the course of a robbery is necessarily ""particularly serious"" because paragraph 5 of Schedule 21 uses the word ""normally"". He submitted that the appropriate starting point should have been 25 years, in accordance with paragraph 5A, because a knife had been taken to the scene. The Court rejected that submission and said, at para. 19: ""It is clear to us that the whole picture of events must be taken into account in assessing whether the seriousness of this case was particularly high. The offence of murder is not to be viewed in isolation but alongside the other offences on the indictment which form part of the overall picture. The facts show a planned aggravated burglary carried out by two men. The originator of the offence was this appellant. He described himself as the 'team captain' during his evidence at trial. The two men forced their way into the victim's flat in the small hours of the morning. They knew the premises were occupied. They were disguised. This appellant had bought the imitation firearm for this very purpose the day before the offence. The accomplice held that weapon. The appellant was brandishing the large chopping knife. The purpose of the break-in was to rob those inside of money and drugs which the robbers believed they would find."" The Court considered the absence of premeditation at para. 21, where it said the following: ""It is clear to us, firstly, that this offence, being a murder committed in the course or furtherance of a robbery or burglary, is one which in the circumstances comes fully within paragraph 5(1). It is not a necessary pre-condition that the killer should at the outset have intended to murder the victim in order to facilitate the commission of the offence of robbery or burglary. Whilst the killing may not have been premeditated in the sense that there was an intention necessarily to kill or do really serious bodily harm prior to entering into the premises, the nature of the attack shows a degree of persistence, and as this court has previously observed in relation to knife crime, every knife carried represents a danger since the consequences of carrying a weapon of that sort are foreseeably serious and extend to murder. We therefore do not consider that the mitigating factor in relation to premeditation carries particular weight in this case."" The Court considered the absence of an intention to kill at para. 22, where it said the following: ""Turning to the absence of an intention to kill, that plainly is a mitigating factor, but, as was observed in R v Peters and others [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 , it cannot be assumed that the absence of an intention to kill necessarily provides very much mitigation. Where a weapon is taken and used and is of a sort which is liable to cause death, the mitigation on this ground is reduced. Thus, when consideration is given to the two factors relied on by the appellant in challenging the starting point, we consider that the case was indeed properly assessed as having a 30 year starting point since the aggravating factors we have earlier identified are of considerable gravity and greatly outweigh the mitigating factors relied on. We do not consider that the judge was wrong. In our judgment, this case properly fell into the category of one involving particularly high seriousness when it is looked at in the round."" At para. 26 the Court expressed the view that an older offender would have attracted a starting point somewhat in excess of the initial 30 year point. Allowance for the mitigation available to the appellant would have reduced that to 30 years but from that figure the judge would then have to make further allowance for the youth of the appellant. In the circumstances of that case, the Court concluded that a reduction of four years to reflect that consideration of age was within the range of reasonable allowance afforded to the sentencing judge. For that reason the minimum term of 26 years was not manifestly excessive. Analysis We will address first a submission which was advanced only by Mr Campbell-Tiech QC on behalf of Higgs. He submits that the judge took the wrong starting point, of 30 years, and should have taken the starting point of 25 years on the basis that this case was properly to be regarded as falling within paragraph 5A of Schedule 21 rather than paragraph 5. Mr Campbell-Tiech reminds this Court that the ""general principles"" set out in Schedule 21 are not prescriptive. Ultimately, he submits, the question which a sentencing judge must ask is ""what is the appropriate starting point which fairly reflects the facts of the particular case?"" Is the seriousness of the murder ""particularly high""?"" He also submits that the structure of Schedule 21 shows that there can be overlapping categories, which necessitates such a judgement having to be formed. For example, paragraph 5(2)(h) refers back to paragraph 4(2). It is clear from those provisions that there can be cases in which, because a person is under the age of 21, a case which would otherwise be in the ""exceptionally high"" category of paragraph 4, and would therefore justify a whole life order, may mean that a 30 year starting point is appropriate. Mr Campbell-Tiech also submits that unlike other cases which the Courts have considered, for example Hummerstone , in this case the criminal enterprise of robbery was brought to an end once the deceased was subjected to the violent attack upon him. He submits that this cannot be said to be properly a murder done ""for gain"". Nor is it a case where the murder was committed in escaping from a burglary or robbery, as was the case on the facts of Bouhaddaou . We do not accept those submissions. In our view, it is clear that this case squarely fell within the terms of paragraph 5, even if it might otherwise have fallen into paragraph 5A. It is quite true that the categories in Schedule 21 are not hermetically sealed. But that does not mean that the judge was not entitled to place this case within paragraph 5. Furthermore, we accept the submission on behalf of the Respondent that it would be unduly artificial to try to separate different elements of what happened in what was inevitably a fast-moving scene. The criminal enterprise did not come to an abrupt end once the attack on the victim which led to his death began. It is also clear, on authority and on the wording of paragraph 5, that a murder ""for gain"" does not necessarily mean that it was committed with the expectation of gain. It will suffice if it is committed ""in the course of"" a robbery or burglary. This is also underlined by the fact that that phrase can be contrasted with what immediately follows, ""in furtherance of"". We next address a submission that was made in particular on behalf of Smith by Mr House QC. He submits that the judge was wrong to say that there were two non-statutory aggravating features in the present case. Those two features were that this was a group attack and that there were other persons present in the flat when the attack occurred, including the victim's girlfriend, Katie Little. Mr House submits that these were not unusual features and will often be found in cases of this kind. He submits that Parliament has effectively subsumed these features when setting the 30 year starting point in para. 5. We disagree. Although they may well be found in many such cases, the fact remains that Parliament has thought it right in enacting paragraph 5 to say that a case may be particularly serious even where these features are not present. In such a case the 30 year starting point would still be applicable. In our view, if anything, the judge would have been entitled to go further. In our view, the aggravating circumstances of this case were not simply as she described them but they also included the fact that Ms Little was physically prevented from going to the assistance of the deceased as he was being attacked in their home. She herself was injured in the process. There were submissions made before this Court on behalf of Higgs and Smith in particular to the effect that there were material differences between the appellants, for example as to the role which each had played. We consider that the judge was entitled, particularly having heard the evidence at the trial, to conclude that there was no material distinction to be drawn between the four of them. On behalf of Higgs it was submitted that the judge failed to have regard to the fact that she had concluded that he was not a dangerous offender, unlike the other appellants. We reject that submission. She clearly had that in mind, as she had mentioned it in her sentencing remarks. It was, however, of no material significance when it came to the determination of the minimum term, since the aim of protection of the public is, as Judge LJ said in Peters , already built into the fact that Parliament has thought it right to require a mandatory life sentence for the offence of murder. This has the consequence that the purposes of the minimum term are punishment and deterrence. We also consider that the judge was entitled to come to the view that there was nothing in the medical reports before her about Smith which should lead to a distinction being made between him and the others. We have read those reports and do not consider that anything in them required her to take a different view. We also bear in mind that, as the trial judge, she would have been familiar with Smith's ability to follow the proceedings. He was not unfit to plead or be tried. He did need the assistance of an intermediary but that did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that his culpability was materially reduced in relation to his offences. Mr House was at pains to emphasise before us that the judge had changed her mind about whether the intermediary should sit with Smith during the trial rather than outside the dock but, in our view, this reinforces the point that she was well placed to assess whether and to what extent this had any material bearing on his culpability for his offences. Accordingly, we have reached the conclusion that, in the circumstances of this case, the judge would have been entitled to go above 30 years before taking into account mitigation. As we have already emphasised, the exercise cannot be conducted in an arithmetical way. What is called for is judgement. The crux of the arguments on behalf of all four appellants is that the judge gave insufficient regard to three features of the case which were present in respect of each of them: (1) Their relatively young ages. (2) The lack of an intention to kill. (3) The lack of premeditation. In our view, the third of those features adds nothing material on the facts of the present case to the second. As we have said earlier, the judge undoubtedly had a difficult sentencing exercise to perform. We commend the thorough way in which she approached her task. In our view, the crucial point is the one which is common to all of these appellants: it is whether the judge at the end of the day gave sufficient weight to both the ages of the appellants and to the fact that she had found that they did not have an intention to kill. We have come to the conclusion that, with respect, she did not give sufficient weight to those two features of this case. In our view, those factors, when taken together, should have led to a minimum term in the case of Higgs and Drage of 26 years rather than 28 years. It is clear from the reasoning of the judge that she carefully sentenced in respect of the other offences for which she had to sentence Smith and Crowley. No complaint was made before this Court about the correctness of those sentences. It follows that the minimum terms in their cases had to be higher than those for Higgs and Drage, particularly bearing in mind the principle of totality and that the other sentences would be concurrent. Applying the thinking of the judge therefore we have come to the conclusion that the appropriate minimum term in the case of Smith should have been one of 29 years rather than 31 years and the minimum term in the case of Crowley should have been one of 32 years rather than 34 years. In each case the number of days spent on remand (268 days) must be deducted from those minimum terms. We have come to the conclusion that, despite the careful way in which the judge approached her task, at the end of the day the minimum terms imposed in these cases were manifestly excessive. They will be reduced in accordance with paras. 78-79 above. To that extent these appeals are allowed. Before we conclude we would like to thank all counsel for their written and oral submissions."

On 13 February 2024, in the Crown Court at Wolverhampton, he was convicted of murder. Two days later, on 15 February 2024, he was sentenced by Wall J to detention at His Majesty's Pleasure with a minimum term of 15 years. The applicant had previously pleaded guilty to one offence of having a bladed article in a public place (count 3). That was the machete that was used to kill the victim, Joseph Richards. On that count the judge passed a term of 12 months' detention to run concurrently with the 15-year minimum term; in other words, the sentence on count 3 did not add to the overall term being served by the applicant. The issue that arises concerns only that concurrent term of 12 months' detention, so it does not in any event affect the overall term imposed on the applicant. In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to set out any detail about the tragic murder of Joseph Richards, early on a summer's evening in July 2023, in Stourbridge in the West Midlands. The Sentence of 12 Months' Detention The sentence of 12 months' detention in respect of possession of the bladed article was unlawful. There are a number of reasons for that. First, the applicant was only 16 years at the time of the sentence and it is accepted by the Crown that the offence of having a bladed article did not meet the criteria of section 250 of the Sentencing Act 2020. In those circumstances, given the applicant's age, no order for detention was available for count 3. Moreover, although a 16-year old can be sentenced to a detention and training order, the criteria required before such an order can be made are not present here. Furthermore, this Court has said on a number of occasions that the making of concurrent or consecutive detention and training orders in circumstances like this is inappropriate. Thus, in R v JC (Carroll) [2004] EWCA Crim 1367, this Court said at [26] that a DTO ""cannot be added as a consecutive sentence to a sentence of detention in a young offender institution"". In R v Dacus [2020] EWCA Crim 1879 at [8] this Court said that ""if someone is sentenced to a lengthy period of detention [as in this case], it is not usually appropriate to pass a concurrent sentence of a DTO for obvious and practical reasons."" Most recently in R v NH [2023] EWCA Crim 241 , a case with very similar facts to this one, a concurrent term of 2 years' detention in a YOI, for possession of a bladed article, was quashed and a sentence of no separate penalty was imposed. When Sir Nigel Davis considered these papers, pursuant to section 31, he referred the matter to the Full Court ""so that no separate penalty can be substituted on ground 3."" We respectfully agree that that is the right course here, that the sentence of 1 year's detention on count 3 concurrent should be quashed and replaced with no separate penalty. Furthermore, in case there is any doubt about it, that order also meets the justice of this situation full on. That is because the fact of possession of the machete led, quite properly, to a longer minimum term for murder than otherwise would have been imposed. The judge explained that clearly in his sentencing remarks: ""18. I will pass concurrent sentences on all of you on count 3, the possession of the machete. This is the factor which dictates the starting points for the murder minimum terms and I do not double count it by using it again in fixing the overall term you must serve."" Thus, for this appellant, the offence of having a bladed article (count 3) had already been taken into account by the judge when he came to fix the starting point for the minimum term he imposed for the murder of Joseph Richards. He rightly did not double count it when considering count 3 - that is why count 3 was concurrent. In those circumstances, because the detention order was unlawful, the right order on count 3 is no separate penalty. To that very limited extent, this appeal is allowed.

This is the factor which dictates the starting points for the murder minimum terms and I do not double count it by using it again in fixing the overall term you must serve."" Thus, for this appellant, the offence of having a bladed article (count 3) had already been taken into account by the judge when he came to fix the starting point for the minimum term he imposed for the murder of Joseph Richards. He rightly did not double count it when considering count 3 - that is why count 3 was concurrent. In those circumstances, because the detention order was unlawful, the right order on count 3 is no separate penalty. To that very limited extent, this appeal is allowed."

Both were sentenced to life imprisonment. In relation to Paul Robert Gowans, now aged 42, the period of 13 years was specified pursuant to the provisions of what later became section 269(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. In relation to Barry Kenneth Hillman, now aged 35, the period of 11 years was specified. On 10th December 2003 the Full Court (Kay LJ, Douglas Brown J and Sir Michael Wright) dismissed the appellants' appeals against conviction. These convictions have now been referred to this court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, it having established that consent to the prosecution had not been provided by the Attorney-General. The background can be summarised very shortly. On 29th January 2000 the appellants attacked and robbed Vytautas Jelinskas, a pizza delivery man. During the robbery he was kicked to the head, sustained a subdural hematoma to the left side of his cranium and was left in a comatosed state from which he never recovered. On 14th August 2000 both men pleaded guilty to robbery and on 16th August both were convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, each man receiving a substantial term of imprisonment. Three days after the convictions, the victim contracted an infection and died of septicaemia. As a result both men were charged with murder. The prosecution case was that the appellants had subjected the victim to a vicious assault in which he sustained brain damage that led to his death 6 or 7 months later. The victim had to undergo invasive procedures as a result of the injuries and these carried a risk of infection. These procedures would not have been required but for the acts of the appellants. The defence case was that there was insufficient evidence to show the acts of the appellants had been a significant cause of the death of the victim and that the original injury did no more than set the scene in which another cause of death had come about. Thus, the issue for the jury turned upon causation and detailed medical evidence was adduced in relation to that issue. The jury having convicted, this court reviewed the convictions and, as we have recounted, dismissed the appeal. Both men then commenced to serve their sentences of life imprisonment. It was, we are told, Mr Hillman who referred the case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission on the grounds, we understand, of fresh medical evidence. In the course of its review the Criminal Cases Review Commission undertook a check to ensure that the Attorney-General had given consent for the prosecution for murder under the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996. That consent was required because section 2 of the Act states that: ""(1)Proceedings to which this section applies may only be instituted by or with the consent of the Attorney General. (2)This section applies to proceedings against a person for a fatal offence if ... (b)the person has previously been convicted of an offence committed in circumstances alleged to be connected with the death."" Having made enquiries both with the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney-General's Office, there is no record of an application having been made for the Attorney-General's consent in relation to the prosecution of these appellants for murder and no record of consent having been sought or granted. Mr Simon Denison QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, does not challenge that conclusion. Although there is no precedent identified where the grounds of appeal were a failure to obtain the Attorney-General's consent to institute proceedings under the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1986, a failure to obtain permission to institute proceedings for other offences in other circumstances has resulted in proceedings being declared a nullity. Thus, R v Angel [1968] 1 WLR 669, the defendant was convicted of offences of gross indecency and buggery with a young boy under section 8 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967. The consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions was required for the institution of such proceedings but had not been obtained. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal stating the proceedings were a nullity without the consent of the DPP. Similarly in R v Pearce [1981] 72 Cr App R 295, a defendant charged with incitement to racial hatred, contrary to section 70 of the Race Relations Act 1976, the Attorney-General's consent was obtained. In the event the indictment was amended to allege a conspiracy to incite racial hatred the Court of Appeal concluded that the conviction for the conspiracy offence could not be sustained on the basis the Attorney-General had not given separate consent for this prosecution. In the circumstances, following the decision of this court in R v Booth (1999) 1 Cr App R 457, we declare that the conviction and judgment be set aside and annulled. This is on the basis that the irregularity in failing to obtain the Attorney-General's consent vitiates the entire trial. The main issue which has been argued before this court has not been that conclusion; it has rather been whether the court should order a venire de novo or exercise its discretion that the appellant should not be tried again. On the face of it the grounds for ordering a venire de novo and thus a trial are extremely strong. These appellants were properly charged with murder, the consequences following conviction being lifelong, not merely in the form of the mandatory period in custody, pending a decision of a Parole Board following the conclusion of the minimum term, but also because of the life licence which permits the State to monitor the continued conduct of all those subject to life sentences. Mr Denison argues that it is in the public interest that those charged with murder should be tried and that the delay, although of substance and not the fault of these appellants, should not prevent that trial from taking place. Mr Russell-Flint QC, for the appellants, submits that this would in fact be the third occasion on which these two appellants would be standing trial for the same incident. The appellants at the time of the incident were 28 and 19 respectively and had served many years in custody already. Further, there was no intention to kill the deceased. Causation remained in issue. The minimum term had long passed and the family of the deceased have made it clear, even at the time of the original sentence for murder, that they bore no malice towards the appellants. Mr Russell-Flint also prays in aid in relation to Mr Gowans the fact that he has now been transferred to an open prison, on the basis that at some time next year he has a realistic prospect of being released on parole. Thus, it is submitted that if fresh proceedings are instituted against him on a charge of murder he could well lose his place in open conditions and, if convicted, would have to recommence the life sentence which he has already served. The position in relation to Mr Hillman is somewhat different. He was transferred to open conditions in or about 2012. While on leave from prison, however, he was arrested, charged and convicted for the offences of rape and assault by penetration for which he was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment, clearly to run concurrently with the life sentence. Not surprisingly he has returned to closed conditions. His appeal against conviction for those offences was dismissed by this court - see [2014] EWCA Crim 2112. The risk that he poses which falls to be considered by the Parole Board is therefore different. The failure to obtain the consent of the Attorney-General is not the fault of either of these appellants. However, in our judgment, it is appropriate and in the interests of justice that a venire de novo should issue and that they be retried on the count of murder which they faced. If there is new medical evidence disclosed to the prosecution doubtless the position can be reconsidered. But in our judgment, the overwhelming public interest that those who are guilty of murder should be convicted and those in respect of whom there is a doubt of guilt acquitted, prevails. That is not however to say that either appellant should be put back into the position in which they were in 2000. Taking the case of Mr Gowans, he has progressed through the minimum term that he was ordered to serve and is now in open conditions near or comparatively near the prospect of release. It would be quite wrong if the decision of this court were taken by the authorities in any sense to affect the risk that he poses to the public. If the Parole Board, based upon all the circumstances, have properly considered him suitable for open conditions, in our judgment, it will be wrong to change that approach simply as a reflection of this decision. Equally we anticipate that if the appellant is convicted every allowance will be made for the fact that he has in fact served the minimum term then considered appropriate, so that the Parole Board would urgently have to consider his case in exactly the same way as if this appeal had never been mounted. The same applies in relation to Mr Hillman although different considerations obtain. To such extent as he is a risk to the public he will not be released from the 8 year sentence until he has served the minimum term required by that sentence, by which time this prosecution will have concluded. He also will fall to be considered (assuming he is convicted) in the same way as if this appeal and retrial had never been necessary. In both cases the present position of these appellants ought to be preserved and they should not suffer a detriment for the consequences of the error to which we have referred. We cannot leave the case without expressing our concern that this error should ever have occurred and that considerable public funds, in the original trial and appeal, should have been wasted because of a failure to obtain appropriate authority. We are assured by Mr Denison that this type of case is now subject to greater supervision within the Crown Prosecution Service and that there is a flag on the system which triggers whenever the consent of the Attorney-General is required which ensures that this requirement is not missed. We trust that this error will not happen again. For the reasons we have identified we make the order namely, that the conviction and judgment be set aside and annulled and that a new trial shall take place on the charge of murder. The defendant is ordered to appear before a Crown Court to be determined by the Presiding Judge for the South Eastern Circuit to plead to the indictment. We make an order that these proceedings shall not be reported until after the conclusion of the retrial. That order is made under section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981. MR RUSSELL-FLINT: Might we obtain a copy of the judgment, my Lords, so that we can, if need be, provided it to the prison authorities if it is anonymised suitably? PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION: In this case we direct that the judgment which will be transcribed should be provided to both appellants and a copy to you or your instructing solicitors if you have any for such use to be made of it as is felt appropriate. MR RUSSELL-FLINT: Thank you very much indeed. Secondly, can I ask this? I have the benefit of a representation order issued by the Registrar. Those who instruct me were instructed by Mr Hillman initially, in respect of the matter referred to in the reasons for the reference to this court to look at the fresh medical evidence that had been obtained. As is set out at paragraph 26 of the statement of reasons for a reference to the Court of Appeal it was as a result of the letter sent by those who instruct me, Messrs Kaim Todner, to the Attorney-General that his office checked as to whether or not the consent, which has led to this appeal being allowed in the terms that it has, to come before this court. The request is that this court, which is empowered to do where it allows an appeal under the 1968 Act against conviction, to order a defendant's costs order in favour of these appellants. It will deal with the work that my solicitors have undertaken in respect of preparing this matter for this appeal. PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION: Is there anything else? Do you need to take instructions on any other aspect of the judgment in the light of your previous observations? MR RUSSELL-FLINT: I do not think I need to take instructions at this stage. We were trying to get down to see Mr Gowans whilst my Lords were considering the judgment. I do not think there any specific point we sought to make. But at the moment I make no application for, if that is what your Lordship is thinking of, bail. We will take instructions with him after this court has dealt with this appeal. PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION: In the normal course my practice would be to say that any application for bail should be made to the Central Criminal Court because the trial will be conducted at a court determined by a presiding judge of the South Eastern circuit likely to be the Central Criminal Court. In the light of the unusual circumstances if you want to mention the case back at 2 o'clock you may do so. MR RUSSELL-FLINT: Thank you very much indeed. PRESIDENT OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION: Is there anything else Mr Denison? We will make a representation order in the terms sought. A defendant's costs order to be assessed if not agreed. MR RUSSELL-FLINT: I am very grateful.

Ms Squire appeared on behalf of the Respondent ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © Lady Justice Andrews: The single issue in this appeal against the appellant's sentence for murder is whether all or any part of the 39 days that he spent abroad awaiting extradition from Nigeria should have been credited towards the minimum term of his life sentence. Unfortunately, this matter appears to have been overlooked in the court below and therefore it was not drawn to the sentencing judge's attention. This oversight by all parties is accepted by the Crown. We are very grateful to Ms Squire for attending this morning to confirm the position. A similar issue arose in R v Noye [2013] EWCA Crim 510 , although in that case the appellant had been detained in custody in Spain awaiting extradition for a much longer period (9 months). In Noye , the Court of Appeal considered the differences between the sentencing regime which applied in that case, and the current regime following the coming into force of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Prior to the coming into force of the 2003 Act, the relevant statutory provisions were in sections 47(1) to (3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Under those provisions, the court had a discretion to direct that some or all of the period spent in custody abroad awaiting extradition should count towards sentence. The court had the power to specify such period ""as in the opinion of the court is just in all the circumstances"" provided it did not exceed the period spent in custody abroad. Each case turned on its specific facts and all relevant factors had to be considered, including why the person went and stayed abroad, and whether there was any resistance to the extradition proceedings. It was recognised to be an important point for consideration that it should not be thought by those who flee this country in the hope of evading justice that, if they are caught and remain in custody in a foreign country for a period of time, the period of time will necessarily be considered as though it had been spent in this country serving the sentence imposed by its courts (see the observations of Lord Judge LCJ in Noye , at paragraph 16). Lord Judge underlined this message at paragraph 19, which explains why the appeal in Noye was dismissed: ""As it seems to us, if this discretion may be exercised in such a way as to refuse to make any allowance for the time spent in custody abroad pending extradition  and plainly the statutory language underlines that it can  it would fall to be exercised where a defendant deliberately fled this country in a well-organised, sophisticated plan to evade justice here; successfully evaded justice for some time by staying abroad; when eventually brought before the courts abroad with a view to extradition, contested the extradition proceedings every inch of the way, and, what is more, put up a totally false story in order to evade extradition followed by...an unsuccessful appeal against the order."" The relevant provision for crediting time served by fixed-term prisoners are now sections 240 and 243 of the 2003 Act. These allow for credit to be given to an extradited prisoner for time served abroad awaiting extradition, provided by section 240(4), that any period will not apply to the extent that ""it is in the opinion of the court just in all the circumstances not to give the appropriate direction"". [Emphasis added]. The effect of the change is that rather than justifying the exercise of the discretion to direct that some or all of the period should count, the sentencing court is required to justify making a decision that it should not count. However, whether the offence was committed before or after the 2003 Act came into force, the main consideration is what is just. Whilst the Court of Appeal in Noye acknowledged that these provisions do not apply expressly to mandatory life sentences, section 269(3) of the 2003 Act, provides that the minimum term in such a case should take into account the effect of any direction that would have been made under section 240 had the sentence been a fixed term sentence. The same position arises by virtue of the application of section 269(3)(b) to the Transitional Provisions, which govern the present case - section 240ZA and section 243(2A) of the 2003 Act. The deceased, a young man named Marcus Hall, was among a group of friends who became involved in a violent altercation with another group of young men outside a nightclub in Luton, in the early hours of the morning of 21 March 2001. At some point Mr Hall became separated from his group and was stabbed, kicked and stamped on by several members of the other group. He later died from his injuries. Following the circulation by police of images of various people they wished to speak to, a police officer identified the appellant and the police made it known that he was wanted for questioning in connection with the murder. In August 2001, the appellant's brother provided a statement to the police identifying him from footage shown on the BBC's Crime Watch programme. However, the appellant left this country for Nigeria (his country of birth) on an unknown date, and the police were therefore unable to apprehend him. It was accepted at the time of his sentence that he knew he was wanted by the police at the time when he left the country. In 2002, a number of men were tried at the Central Criminal Court and convicted of Mr Hall's murder. A further man was tracked to the USA and extradited. He too was convicted of the murder following a trial in 2004. On 12 February 2015, the appellant was arrested in Lagos for unrelated matters. He was then using a different name but after his fingerprints were taken, his identity was confirmed. Once it became known that he was wanted in the UK for the offence of murder, he was arrested for that offence. He was detained in custody in Lagos and then transferred to Abuja, where an Extradition Notice was served on him. He did not contest his extradition and was returned to the UK on 24 March 2015, where he was immediately handed over to and arrested by the UK authorities. The day after his arrest in Nigeria, he provided information to an Inspector Ebelo (a Nigerian police officer) and provided a voluntary signed statement in which he accepted presence at the scene of the incident in Luton in 2001, and that he had kicked the deceased once or twice. On 27th March 2015, at a preliminary hearing in the Crown Court at Luton, the appellant indicated an intention to plead guilty to murder and a basis of plea was submitted. In due course, he appeared before HHJ Kay KC on 4 September 2015 and pleaded guilty to the charge of murder. Since the date of the murder predated the coming into force of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was arrived at by the application of transitional arrangements for mandatory life sentences for offences committed before December 2003, as provided by section 276 and Schedule 22 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The judge explained that he was passing sentence after the commencement of section 269 of the 2003 Act in respect of an offence committed before that date, and he was therefore constrained in his approach by paragraphs 9 and 10 of Schedule 22. That meant he was required to have regard to what the Secretary of State would have been likely to notify as the minimum term to be served under the regime as it existed in 2001 and earlier. The judge had regard to the sentences passed on the others who were convicted of the same murder, and who had been engaged in similar activity to the appellant. He set a minimum term of 10 years' imprisonment, about which no complaint can be or is made. He directed that the time that the appellant had spent in custody in the UK was to be counted against his sentence, resulting in a period of 9 years and 202 days to serve before he would be eligible for release. In the present case, it is true that the appellant deliberately fled the country to avoid being arrested for the murder and that he managed to evade detection for 14 years. However, those matters have already been taken into consideration as part of his sentence. Although he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and indeed made admissions the day after his arrest, in deciding on the minimum term the judge set against the credit to which the appellant would otherwise have been entitled for his guilty plea (which under the relevant regime was 20 months) the period during which he had evaded justice. It was not until June 2023 that the appellant contacted the solicitor who had represented him at trial, and raised the query about whether the time he spent in custody in Nigeria should also have been counted against his sentence. This was a matter that he had only recently found out about whilst he was in custody. The necessary extension of time for seeking leave to appeal was properly granted by the single judge in those circumstances. Given that the appellant did all the right things once he was apprehended in Nigeria - he co-operated in his extradition, and he made admissions as to his role in the murder at an early stage - we consider that it is in the interests of justice to direct that the full period of 39 days he spent in custody in Nigeria awaiting extradition should count towards the minimum term of his sentence. We therefore allow this appeal and vary the sentence to one of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 10 years, with a direction that the time that the appellant spent in custody in Nigeria awaiting extradition and the time that he spent in custody in the UK shall both be counted towards his sentence, resulting in a term of 9 years and 163 days to serve before he is eligible for release. The Court is very grateful indeed to Ms Nwosu for her very helpful skeleton argument in this case, which has illuminated the matter for us and made it very easy to decide how we should determine the appeal.

Ms Squire appeared on behalf of the Respondent ____________________ ____________________ Lady Justice Andrews: The single issue in this appeal against the appellant's sentence for murder is whether all or any part of the 39 days that he spent abroad awaiting extradition from Nigeria should have been credited towards the minimum term of his life sentence. Unfortunately, this matter appears to have been overlooked in the court below and therefore it was not drawn to the sentencing judge's attention. This oversight by all parties is accepted by the Crown. We are very grateful to Ms Squire for attending this morning to confirm the position. A similar issue arose in R v Noye [2013] EWCA Crim 510 , although in that case the appellant had been detained in custody in Spain awaiting extradition for a much longer period (9 months). In Noye , the Court of Appeal considered the differences between the sentencing regime which applied in that case, and the current regime following the coming into force of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Prior to the coming into force of the 2003 Act, the relevant statutory provisions were in sections 47(1) to (3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Under those provisions, the court had a discretion to direct that some or all of the period spent in custody abroad awaiting extradition should count towards sentence. The court had the power to specify such period ""as in the opinion of the court is just in all the circumstances"" provided it did not exceed the period spent in custody abroad. Each case turned on its specific facts and all relevant factors had to be considered, including why the person went and stayed abroad, and whether there was any resistance to the extradition proceedings. It was recognised to be an important point for consideration that it should not be thought by those who flee this country in the hope of evading justice that, if they are caught and remain in custody in a foreign country for a period of time, the period of time will necessarily be considered as though it had been spent in this country serving the sentence imposed by its courts (see the observations of Lord Judge LCJ in Noye , at paragraph 16). Lord Judge underlined this message at paragraph 19, which explains why the appeal in Noye was dismissed: ""As it seems to us, if this discretion may be exercised in such a way as to refuse to make any allowance for the time spent in custody abroad pending extradition  and plainly the statutory language underlines that it can  it would fall to be exercised where a defendant deliberately fled this country in a well-organised, sophisticated plan to evade justice here; successfully evaded justice for some time by staying abroad; when eventually brought before the courts abroad with a view to extradition, contested the extradition proceedings every inch of the way, and, what is more, put up a totally false story in order to evade extradition followed by...an unsuccessful appeal against the order.""

He was cautioned a year or two before the incident which we are about to narrate for pinching a yo-yo, but he is a young man of good character without previous convictions and, as Mr Bidder QC pointed out in his skeleton argument to us, effectively there was no evidence to suggest that it was of a violent disposition. On 18th July 2000 in the Crown Court at Cardiff, before Curtis J, he pleaded not guilty to murder. The case proceeded as a trial until the conclusion of the prosecution case. At that stage he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The basis of the plea then tendered was in effect no intent, or no sufficient evidence of intent. The plea was not accepted. The trial continued. On 24th July he was acquitted of murder and convicted of manslaughter. On the following day he was sentenced to nine years' detention under section 53(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. He appeals against sentence with the leave of the single judge. This is a very sad case. The appellant at the relevant time in November 1999 was 16 years old, nearly 17. The victim of the homicide was another young man, Shane Martinson, also 16 years old. They lived in Barry in Glamorgan. They went to the same school, and during the autumn of 1999 they started socialising with the same group of friends, visiting each other's houses and so on in the way that teenagers do. Although they were in the same group, they did not appear to get on very well and could not be described as friends. They were just part of the same circle. On 20th November 1999 they went to a party. The appellant drank a fair amount of alcohol. The deceased apparently did not. They then went on to the home of another friend for a pre-arranged party. Eventually most of those at that party left at about quarter past 1 in the morning. That left the young man in whose home it was taking place, a man called Adrian Lewis, the appellant, the deceased and a girl of much the same age. The situation then became rather tense. There was some argument and an exchange of personal insults. The appellant was heard to call the deceased ""green teeth"". The deceased apparently responded with words like ""smelly Arab"". All very unpleasant, but it did not need to result in the disaster which then occurred. The appellant had been drinking a great deal and was getting progressively drunker. We cannot say why the jury reached the conclusion that it did and we do not propose, nor could we, to go behind that conclusion. But we have little doubt that the jury was addressed on the basis that one of the factors they had to take into account was whether the alcohol which this young man had consumed meant that he did not have the necessary intention for murder. There was a challenge by the deceased to the appellant to ""come outside"". The appellant declined that invitation. There was then some evidence, which the jury may well have accepted, that the appellant was egged on to fight, and accused of being frightened of having a fight. Eventually, in view of what the appellant was to say, it looks as though that may have had its impact on him. Shortly afterwards the young woman in the house saw the appellant holding a kitchen knife. Very sensibly she told him not to be stupid. They left the kitchen. The appellant put the knife in the belt of his trousers and sat down. The deceased then went upstairs to the lavatory. The appellant suddenly jumped up and made his way upstairs saying, ""If you want me to fight him, I'll fight him."" That was no dispute that that was said. That confirms the evidence that someone at any rate may have been egging him on to fight. When the deceased came out of the lavatory, the appellant lunged at him with the knife in his right hand, saying words to this effect ,""If you want to fight, I'll fight you."" A struggle then followed. The two young men went to the ground. The others tried to part them. Both stood up. A punch was thrown. By now the deceased was holding his chest. He asked for an ambulance to be called. He was assisted downstairs and placed on a sofa. It was clear that he was bleeding heavily. In fact he suffered five stab wounds, one in effect through the heart, and although the ambulance arrived and the deceased was taken to hospital, he had received fatal injuries. His life could not be saved. So far as the appellant was concerned, he sat, waited for the ambulance to be called, was apparently crying and heard to keep repeating, ""I'm going to jail. I'm going to get done for murder"", or words to that effect. After the ambulance had been summoned, he left and went home and told his own parents what had happened. After the deceased had been taken to hospital his parents drove him back to the premises. The appellant was seen to be crying hysterical and repeating, ""I didn't mean to stab him."" He was arrested. He was interviewed on a number of occasions. He admitted that he was responsible for the stabbing. He blamed the alcohol. He implied that he had been egged on. He said he could not recall how he came into possession of the knife. The sentencing judge regarded this as a very serious case of manslaughter. He said to the appellant in his sentencing remarks that the jury had convicted him on the basis that the prosecution had not proved the requisite intent for murder. He said that he would faithfully reflect that finding in favour of the appellant and that the appellant had indicated for a long time that he would be willing to admit manslaughter. The judge went on to record, as we do, that no sentence that he could pass would bring the young man who had died back to life. He described that as a tragedy both for him and his family, and indeed for the young man at whose hands he had met his death. He said that he regarded this as a particularly bad case. He set out the relevant facts. He ended his sentencing remarks by describing this as a: ""... determined, wicked and senseless act, and is close to a murder case ..."" adding: ""... by the verdict of the jury [it] did not amount to murder."" These observations were made by a very senior and experienced judge at the end of a trial over which he had presided. We attach great weight to them. We note in particular how the judge considered that this case came, as he put it, ""close to murder"". No doubt he was reflecting, in particular, the fact that an aggravating feature in a case of manslaughter was that the appellant had deliberately armed himself and had gone upstairs. But the reality was that strong as the case may have appeared, and powerful as it appears to us on paper, the jury took the view that the right verdict was manslaughter. As the judge said, and we must, the sentence had to be passed on that basis. We have here a homicide committed by a young man who was still only 16 at the time, apparently under some pressure from others in the house to fight, who deliberately took the knife upstairs and used it in the course of a fight. All that said, he pleaded guilty. This is notoriously a difficult decision for any sentencing judge. Mr Bidder kindly drew our attention in a very careful analysis to a whole series of sentencing decisions of this Court in cases of this kind. We considered them and in addition took account of our own experience as sentencing judges and judges sitting in this Court about the appropriate level of sentencing in cases of this kind. We have concluded that in this case a sentence of nine years on this young man on a plea was somewhat excessive, certainly sufficiently excessive for us to feel it right to interfere. There are cases where much lower sentences are imposed in other situations. In this case, to reflect the aggravating features of the case of manslaughter, and in particular the deliberate self-arming, notwithstanding that the appellant was a young man of 16 at the time when he became involved, we think that the appropriate level of sentence is one of seven years in custody. To that extent this appeal will be allowed.

As the judge said, and we must, the sentence had to be passed on that basis. We have here a homicide committed by a young man who was still only 16 at the time, apparently under some pressure from others in the house to fight, who deliberately took the knife upstairs and used it in the course of a fight. All that said, he pleaded guilty. This is notoriously a difficult decision for any sentencing judge. Mr Bidder kindly drew our attention in a very careful analysis to a whole series of sentencing decisions of this Court in cases of this kind. We considered them and in addition took account of our own experience as sentencing judges and judges sitting in this Court about the appropriate level of sentencing in cases of this kind. We have concluded that in this case a sentence of nine years on this young man on a plea was somewhat excessive, certainly sufficiently excessive for us to feel it right to interfere. There are cases where much lower sentences are imposed in other situations. In this case, to reflect the aggravating features of the case of manslaughter, and in particular the deliberate self-arming, notwithstanding that the appellant was a young man of 16 at the time when he became involved, we think that the appropriate level of sentence is one of seven years in custody. To that extent this appeal will be allowed."

C. appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © (As approved by judge ) LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF : Mr. Justice Farquharson is absent on circuit; the judgment I am about to deliver is the judgment of the court, on which we are all agreed. On 27th March, 1981 the appellant, David Keith Pagett, was convicted, after a trial before Mr. Justice Park and a jury, on a number of counts relating to very serious offences  one count of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life; two counts of kidnapping; three counts of attempted murder; and one count of manslaughter. On each count he was sentenced to a term of 12 years' imprisonment concurrent. The evidence before the jury (which must have been substantially accepted by them) reveals a terrible story, with a tragic conclusion. The appellant, who was aged 31 and was separated from his wife, formed a relationship with a young girl called Gail Kinchen. In June 1980 Gail, who was then aged 16 and was six months pregnant by the appellant, left him after various domestic upsets and returned to the home of her mother and stepfather (Mr. and Mrs. Wood) in Brandon Park Road, Birmingham. On the evening of 11th June the appellant armed himself with his brother's shotgun and a number of cartridges and then went off in his sister's mini-car to look for Gail. He arrived at the Woods' house at 77 Brandon Park Road shortly after midnight. Mr. Wood answered the door, and found the appellant standing there with a shotgun held in both hands at an angle of about 45°. The appellant said: ""Now try your commando tricks. "" Mr. Wood slammed the door and ran through the house, out into the garden. He tried to push his wife into a lean-to shed. The appellant followed him. Mrs. Wood turned and saw him aiming his gun at her husband. She knocked the gun into the air; as she did so, she heard a bang. The appellant hit her on the head with the gun and she fell to the ground. The appellant then fired the gun at Mr. Wood as he fled over the garden fence a few feet away. Mr. Wood was shot in his rear left thigh; later over 100 pellets were removed from an area covering about nine inches. The appellant then frogmarched Mrs. Wood away; she was shouting for help as she went. He dragged her off to his car, asking where Gail was. Mrs. Wood directed him to the area where she and her husband had earlier dropped Gail to visit her friend Maria. The appellant still carried his shotgun, which he had reloaded. They arrived at the flat where Gail was, 15 Masefield Square. There were various people there, including Gail. The appellant lined them up, waving his shotgun at them. He hit Gail; as Mrs. Wood tried to grab the gun, he hit her with it in the ribs, knocking her to the floor. She was later found to have cracked or fractured ribs in her lower right chest. He called Gail, who was crying; she went out. He hit her again in the hall. There were thuds, as if she had fallen downstairs. He called for Mrs. Wood; she asked the others to call the police, and went out to join the appellant and Gail. The appellant drove off in the mini, with Mrs. Wood in the passenger seat and Gail sitting on her lap. He kept on hitting Gail. A police car came up; in it were two police officers who were on the lookout for the mini which was believed to contain an armed man wanted after a shooting incident. Gail signalled to it; the appellant threatened to kill both Gail and Mrs. Wood. Mrs. Wood got out on the passenger side; her evidence was that the appellant hit her on the head and knocked her out of the car. The appellant and Gail got out on the driver's side. Gail was hysterical, pleading with the appellant not to shoot Mrs. Wood. The officers got out of their car. The appellant threatened them with his gun, shouting: ""Back off. I am going to shoot you. "" The officers took cover in a nearby garden. The appellant then drove off with Gail. The officers returned to their car and followed the appellant's mini to Deelands Road, where it stopped. Two other officers had arrived at Deelands Road. The appellant and Gail got out of the mini; the appellant was carrying his shotgun, and Gail was walking in front of him. The appellant gestured with his gun at the officers and said: ""One more step pal, and I will let you have it. "" The appellant took Gail into a block of flats, No. 21 Deelands Road. No. 21 Deelands Road consisted of three floors, with two flats on each floor, opening out of a common central staircase. The appellant took Gail into his flat, No. 4, which was on the first floor. A number of police cars were by then parked opposite the flat, about 250 yards away, with their headlights on. A police officer, using a loud hailer, told the appellant to surrender his gun and come out. The appellant shouted to the police to turn their lights off or he would shoot at them and he would shoot the girl. Headlights were put out. The officer with the loud hailer again told the appellant to surrender his gun and come out. The appellant said that there was no way he would come out alive, he would shoot the girl and himself. The police told him that Mr. Wood was not badly hurt; he refused to come out, saying that he would get 17 years. He shouted for other car lights to be put out, and then fired his gun twice at the cars. They were hit but not badly damaged; some police officers were hit by pellets but not injured. Gail shouted out: ""Please move or he will shoot me. "" The police cars were moved. By then, police officers trained in the use of weapons and in the handling of ""hostage situations"" had arrived on the scene. They were split into three teams of two officers each. Two officers were stationed in the entrance to the block of flats; two others were stationed at the rear. The third pair of officers, D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards, entered the public part of the block of flats, in order to contain the appellant. D. C. Richards, using a loud hailer, called on the appellant to surrender. Shortly before 2 a. m., the appellant brought Gail out on to the balcony at the rear of his flat. He appeared to have a gun in his right hand, which was round her waist, and his left hand was round her neck. He shouted for the police to go or he would shoot; he said that if they did not leave he would kill her. Gail screamed: ""Get back or he will kill me. "" One of the officers called out to the appellant that he was surrounded by armed police, and should come out. The appellant shouted back and took the girl back into the flat. Meanwhile D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards had taken up position on the landing on the first floor, outside the adjacent doors of Nos. 3 and 4. There was only one light on in the common staircase, at the rear of the ground floor. The two officers were provided with bullet-proof jackets. The peephole in the front door of No. 4 was covered with mud by the police. There was no sound in the flat; the officers thought that the appellant and Gail might be asleep. Then the door was unlocked and opened. There was no light inside the flat. A shotgun barrel was poked out of the doorway. D. S. Sartain shouted that they were armed. The door was closed. Then it opened again. The shape of a woman (it must have been Gail) was in the doorway. The appellant had his left arm round her neck. The gun was in his right hand, pointing at the police officers. The appellant told them to get downstairs. The officers warned him several times that they were armed, and told the appellant to stand still and drop his gun. The appellant moved towards the officers pushing Gail in front of him. The two officers retreated to the top landing. It was very dark up there. D. S. Sartain walked along the landing, but could see nothing downstairs; he returned to D. C. Richards at the top of the stairs. He stood by the banister. D. C. Richards was on his right. They could see practically nothing. They could hear the appellant threatening to kill them. The appellant said to Gail: ""Talk to them, they don't think I mean it. "" Gail screamed: ""he is going to kill me. "" The appellant shouted out words to the effect that they were testing him and he was going to show them. A figure loomed round the corner on the upper flight of the stairs and started coming up towards the police officers. As D. C. Richards shouted to the appellant to stand still, the appellant fired his shotgun. D. S. Sartain fired two shots, and D. C. Richards fired four. There was another shotgun blast from the appellant. D. C. Richards fired two more shots, and D. S. Sartain one. The officers had fired their guns instinctively, not taking any particular aim. Gail shouted: ""You've shot me. You've shot me. "" As D. C. Richards was reloading his gun, D. S. Sartain ran down the stairs. D. C. Richards followed. They found the appellant sitting on the floor at the corner of the landing, with Gail sitting on top of him. The shotgun was on the floor: D. S. Sartain slid it out of the appellant's reach. Thirteen unused cartridges were later found in the appellant's pocket. It was plain that he had been using Gail as a shield as he went up the stairs, though the police officers could not see this. She received three bullet wounds, of which she later died. The appellant was unharmed by the bullets fired by the police officers. Very fortunately, the two police officers were unharmed by the shots fired by the appellant, which struck the banister and were deflected up towards the ceiling. At the trial, the appellant dismissed his counsel and defended himself. He called no evidence, but made a statement from the dock and a closing speech. We need not burden this judgment with his defence, which was plainly rejected by the jury. He was convicted by the jury of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life; of kidnapping Mrs. Wood and Gail Kinchen; of the attempted murder of Mr. Wood, D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards. He was acquitted of the murder of Gail, but convicted of her manslaughter. The present appeal against conviction is concerned only with the conviction of the manslaughter of Gail Kinchen. In a sense, it is academic; because, although there is an application that if the conviction of manslaughter should be quashed the sentence should be reviewed, it appears to the court to be inevitable, having regard to the extreme gravity of the other offences of which he was convicted, that the sentence of 12 years for the other offences should stand in any event. However, the grounds of appeal raise a question of law alone and for that reason the appeal has been referred directly to the full court. The question of law relates to the direction given by the learned judge to the jury in respect of the count of murder, and the alternative count of manslaughter, of Gail Kinchen. He directed the jury as follows. First he gave them the full definition of murder in the following terms: ""A person who unlawfully and deliberately causes the death of another person intending to kill or to do serious bodily harm to that person is guilty of murder, and so in the present case the prosecution have to prove beyond all reasonable doubt two things: first that by his unlawful and deliberate acts the defendant caused Gail's death or was a cause of her death. Secondly, in doing those acts he intended to kill or to do serious bodily harm to her. "" Next he considered with the jury the two acts of the appellant which the prosecution contended were unlawful and deliberate and which caused her death, viz. (1) the firing of the gun at the police officers (which he explained could constitute an assault), and (2) the physical force applied to Gail so that her body could be used as a shield (which again he explained could constitute an assault). Then the learned judge turned to the question of causation. On this, he directed the jury as follows: ""Now, Members of the Jury, if you were satisfied that he did those 2 unlawful and deliberate acts, the question now becomes whether by those acts he caused or was a cause of Gail's death. It sometimes happens that difficult questions arise when a jury has to decide whether something is a cause of the death of the victim. This is just such a case. In those circumstances it is for me to decide as a question of law whether by his unlawful and deliberate acts the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death, but the answer to that question of law depends upon findings of fact which you alone can decide, and accordingly I have to direct you that if you find the facts I am about to mention proved beyond all reasonable doubt, then the defendant would have caused or been a cause of Gail's death. It might help you if I explain that the act of an accused person on the charge of murder need not be the sole cause or even the main cause of the death of the victim. It is not necessary to prove actual physical violence on the victim by the accused, but let me illustrate that point by an old case which came before the courts years and years ago. A man quarrelled with the woman he was living with. He ran towards her in order to hit her but he did not succeed in doing so. In fear or in retreat from the attack she jumped or fell from a window and was killed. The courts held that he, although he had not laid a finger on her, was a cause of her death. ""I turn now to the question whether the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death. I am going to mention the facts. If you are sure that the following facts have been proved beyond all reasonable doubt, then the defendant would have caused or would have been a cause of Gail's death. First of all, that he fired the shot-gun deliberately at the police officers before any shot was fired by them. In other words, sure that he fired first. Secondly that his act in firing at the police officers caused them to fire back with the result that bullets from their weapons shot Gail and caused her death. Next, that in firing back for that reason the police acted reasonably either by way of self-defence or in the performance of their duty as police officers, or both. I will explain that in a little more detail in a moment. Lastly, that from the beginning to the end of the firing Gail was being used against her will and by force by the defendant as a shield to protect him from any shots fired by the police. If you are not sure about any of those matters, acquit him, and you will acquit him of course because the chain which links his deliberate and unlawful acts with Gail's death will have been broken. "" Having directed the jury on causation in those terms, he then turned to the question whether the police officers fired at the appellant because they had been fired at by him, and if so, whether they acted reasonably; and in doing so, he explained to the jury both the law relating to self-defence and, in relation to the question whether the police acted reasonably in the performance of their duties as police officers, the legal principle that a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of an offender or a suspected offender. Finally, in connection with the count of murder, he gave the following direction on the necessary intent (plainly founded upon Hyam v. D. P. P. (1975) A C 55 ): ""Members of the jury, if you were satisfied by the evidence so that you felt sure that the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death, the prosecution must next satisfy you on the charge of murder that by his deliberate and unlawful acts he intended either to kill Gail or to cause her really serious bodily harm. In other words, they must satisfy you that he acted with a willingness in his mind to produce, as a consequence of what he did, either the death of Gail or serious bodily injury to her. ""The prosecution will have established the necessary intent if they satisfy you that in doing what he did, he knew that it was probable that his unlawful acts would result in Gail's death or in really serious bodily harm to her. ""I have used the word 'knew'. Another word which expresses equally well the state of mind which has to be proved is 'foresaw'; he foresaw that it was probable that his unlawful acts would result in Gail's death or in really serious bodily harm to her. "" Having directed the jury on the count of murder, the learned judge turned to the alternative count of manslaughter. Here he gave a direction (obviously founded upon D. P. P. v. Newbury (1977) A C 500 ) as follows: ""A person would be guilty of manslaughter if he intentionally did an act which was unlawful and dangerous, and that act caused the death of another person. For this purpose  the purpose of the charge of manslaughter  the unlawful act must be such as all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to the risk of some harm resulting from it, albeit not serious harm. On a charge of manslaughter it is not necessary to prove that the accused knew that his act or acts were unlawful, nor is it necessary to prove that he knew his acts were dangerous. ""So if you were sure in this case that the two unlawful acts  the assault on the police by firing at them and the assault on Gail  considered in the way I have described, caused Gail's death and that they were acts which all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise would subject Gail to the risk of some harm, then the defendant would be guilty of manslaughter. "" It is difficult to imagine a more lucid and careful summing-up on these topics, in a form designed to be as fair as possible to the appellant and at the same time as helpful as possible to the jury. The criticism of the summing-up, advanced in this court by Lord Gifford (to whose argument we are much indebted), was directed primarily to the direction to the jury on causation, which was of course equally applicable to the count of murder and the alternative count of manslaughter. The three specific points raised on behalf of the appellant were as follows (we quote from the grounds of appeal): (1) The learned judge erred in law in directing that the jury must as a matter of law find that the appellant caused the death of the deceased, if they were satisfied as to the four matters of fact which he sets out. The learned judge ought rather to have left it to the jury to determine as an issue of fact whether the defendant's act in firing at the police officers was a substantial, or operative, or imputable, cause of the death of the deceased. (2) In the alternative, if the learned judge was correct in himself determining as a matter of law what facts would amount to causation of the death by the appellant, he ought to have held that the appellant had not in the circumstances of this case caused the death of the deceased. The learned judge, in directing himself upon the law, ought to have held that where the act which immediately-resulted in fatal injury was the act of another party, albeit in legitimate self-defence, then the ensuing death was too remote or indirect to be imputed to the original aggressor. (3) If the learned judge's direction as to causation was correct, then he erred in law in directing the jury that they could bring in an alternative verdict of manslaughter. The requirement that the jury had to be satisfied that the deceased was being used by the appellant as a shield required the jury to apply a test which was the same or very similar to the test of mens rea in murder. The argument addressed to this court by Lord Gifford on behalf of the appellant was concentrated primarily on the first and second grounds of appeal, and was as presented concerned with the issue of causation. We find it convenient to deal first with the second ground of appeal. We do so because this ground raises a particular, defined, issue, founded upon certain United States authorities; furthermore, having considered those authorities and the submission founded upon them, we are satisfied that this ground of appeal is not well-founded, and we feel that it would be more satisfactory if we were to deal with this point before turning to consider the more fundamental question raised on the first ground of appeal. The United States authorities cited to us, which reflect some diversity of judicial opinion, were concerned with the question whether an accused person could be convicted of the murder or manslaughter of a person by shooting, where the fatal shot was fired not by the accused but by some other person. In Commonwealth v. Almeida 362 Pa. 596 (1949), a case concerned with a robbery in the course of which shots were exchanged with police officers and a police officer was killed, the accused (one of the robbers) was convicted of the murder of the police officer. It was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, following dicta in the earlier case of Commonwealth v. Moyer 357 Pa. l8l (1947), that it was immaterial whether the shot which killed the police officer was fired by one of the robbers or by a police officer, the circumstances being such that the police officers were acting both in justifiable self-defence and in the performance of their duty. In these circumstances, even if the fatal shot was fired by one of the police officers, ""The felonious acts of the robbers in firing shots at the policemen, well knowing that their fire would be returned, as it should have been, was (sic) the proximate cause of Officer Ingling's death"". The point was, as appears from this brief quotation, considered by the court to raise a question of causation. The decision was subsequently followed in Commonwealth v. Thomas 382 Pa. 639. However, in Commonwealth v. Redline 137 Atl. (2d. ) (Pa. ) (1958), the earlier case of Thomas was overruled, and Almeida itself, although not formally overruled, was plainly disapproved by the majority of the court. In Redline , it fell to the court to consider a case of armed robbery which gave rise to a gun battle between the robbers and police officers, in the course of which one of the robbers was killed by a bullet fired by one of the police officers. A majority of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held (following a number of earlier authorities, including in particular Commonwealth v. Campbell 89 Mass, 541 (1863), Butler v. The People 125 Ill. 64l (1888), and Commonwealth v. Moore 121 Ky. 97 (1905)) that the conviction of one of the robbers for the murder of the deceased robber could not stand, the fatal shot not having been fired by him but by another person with whom he was not acting in concert. It was on this case in particular, and on the earlier cases cited in it, that Lord Gifford founded his argument in the present case. Examination of the reasoning of the majority of the court in Redline shows, however, that the decision provides no useful guidance to an English court today. The point is that the reasoning of the Pennsylvanian court was concerned with the scope of the felony murder doctrine which, since the abolition of constructive malice in murder by section 1 of the Homicide Act, 1957, forms no part of English law. The approach of the majority of the Pennsylvanian court is amply illustrated by the following passage taken from page 476 of the report: ""In adjudging a felony-murder, it is to be remembered at all times that the thing which is imputed to a felon for a killing incidental to his felony is malice and not the act of killing . The mere coincidence of homicide and felony is not enough to satisfy the requirement of the felony-murder doctrine.... ""The legal situation which for years obtained in this State in cases of felony-murder was aptly epitomized by Mr. Justice Parker in Commonwealth v. Guida 341 Pa. 505, 308, 19 A. 2d. 100, as follows: '.... if a person killed another in doing or attempting to do another act, and if the act done or attempted to be done was a felony, the killing was murder. There was thus supplied the state of mind called malice which was essential to constitute murder. The malice of the initial offense attaches to whatever else the criminal may do in connection therewith. '.... And so, until the decision of this court in Commonwealth v. Almeida ...., the rule which was uniformly followed, whether by express statement or by implication, was that in order to convict for felony-murder, the killing must have been done by the defendant or by an accomplice or confederate or by one acting in furtherance of the felonious undertaking . "" It was this principle, reflected in the earlier cases, which was reaffirmed in the case of Redline. It at once becomes apparent that the case of Redline , and the earlier cases cited in it in support of the conclusion in that case, are of no assistance to an English court concerned with the English law of murder, of which the felony-murder doctrine forms no part. Even so, it was pressed upon us by Lord Gifford that there either was, or should be, a comparable rule of English law, whereby, as a matter of policy, no man should be convicted of homicide (or, we imagine, any crime of violence to another person) unless he himself, or another person acting in concert with him, fired the shot (or, we imagine, struck the blow) which was the immediate cause of the victim's death (or injury). No English authority was cited to us in support of any such proposition, and we know of none. So far as we are aware, there is no such rule in English law; and, in the absence of any doctrine of constructive malice, we can see no basis in principle for any such rule in English law. Lord Gifford urged upon us that, in a case where the accused did not, for example, fire the shot which was the immediate cause of the victim's death, he will inevitably have committed some lesser crime, and that it would be sufficient that he should be convicted of that lesser crime. So, on the facts of the present case, it would be enough that the appellant was convicted of the crime of attempted murder of the two police officers, D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards. We see no force in this submission. In point of fact, it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which it would manifestly be inadequate for the accused merely to be convicted of a lesser offence; for example, a man besieged by armed terrorists in a house might attempt to make his escape by forcing some other person to act as a shield, knowing full well that that person would in all probability be shot, and possibly killed, in consequence. For that man merely to be convicted of an assault would, if the person he used as a shield were to be shot and killed, surely be inadequate in the circumstances; we can see no reason why he should not be convicted at least of manslaughter. But in any event there is, so far as we can discern, no basis of legal principle in Lord Gifford's submission. We are therefore unable to accept it. In our judgment, the question whether an accused person can be held guilty of homicide, either murder or manslaughter, of a victim the immediate cause of whose death is the act of another person must be determined on the ordinary principles of causation, uninhibited by any such rule of policy as that for which Lord Gifford has contended. We therefore reject the second ground of appeal. We turn to the first ground of appeal, which is that the learned judge erred in directing the jury that it was for him to decide as a matter of law whether by his unlawful and deliberate acts the appellant caused or was a cause of Gail Kinchen's death. It is right to observe that this direction of the learned judge followed upon a discussion with counsel, in the absence of the jury; though the appellant, having dismissed his own counsel, was for this purpose without legal representation. In the course of this discussion, counsel for the prosecution referred the learned judge to a passage in Professor Smith and Professor Hogan's Criminal Law, 4th ed., at page 272, which reads as follows: ""Causation is a question of both fact and law. D's act cannot be held to be the cause of an event if the event would have occurred without it. The act, that is, must be a sine qua non of the event and whether it is so is a question of fact. But there are many-acts which are sine qua non of a homicide and yet are not either in law, or in ordinary parlance, the cause of it. If I invite P to dinner and he is run over and killed on the way, my invitation may be a sine qua non of his death, but no one would say I killed him and I have not caused his death in law. Whether a particular act which is a sine qua non of an alleged actus reus is also a cause of it is a question of law. Where the facts are admitted the judge may direct the jury that a particular act did, or did not, cause a particular result. "" There follows a reference to R. v. Jordan (1956) 40 Cr. App. E. 152. For the appellant, Lord Gifford criticised the statement of the learned authors that ""Whether a particular act which is a sine qua non of an alleged actus reus is also a cause of it is a question of law"". He submitted that that question had to be answered by the jury as a question of fact. In our view, with all respect, both the passage in Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law, and Lord Gifford's criticism of it, are over-simplifications of a complex matter. We have no intention of embarking in this judgment on a dissertation of the nature of causation, or indeed of considering any matters other than those which are germane to the decision of the issues now before us. Problems of causation have troubled philosophers and lawyers throughout the ages; and it would be rash in the extreme for us to trespass beyond the boundaries of our immediate problem. Our comments should therefore be understood to be confined not merely to the criminal law, but to cases of homicide (and possibly also other crimes of violence to the person); and it must be emphasised that the problem of causation in the present case is specifically concerned with the intervention of another person (here one of the police officers) whose act was the immediate cause of the death of the victim, Gail Kinchen. In cases of homicide, it is rarely necessary to give the jury any direction on causation as such. Of course, a necessary ingredient of the crimes of murder and manslaughter is that the accused has by his act caused the victim's death. But how the victim came by his death is usually not in dispute. What is in dispute is more likely to be some other matter: for example, the identity of the person who committed the act which indisputably caused the victim's death; or whether the accused had the necessary intent; or whether the accused acted in self-defence, or was provoked. Even where it is necessary to direct the jury's minds to the question of causation, it is usually enough to direct them simply that in law the accused's act need not be the sole cause, or even the main cause, of the victim's death, it being enough that his act contributed significantly to that result. It is right to observe in passing, however, that even this simple direction is a direction of law relating to causation, on the basis of which the jury are bound to act in concluding whether the prosecution has established, as a matter of fact, that the accused's act did in this sense cause the victim's death. Occasionally, however, a specific issue of causation may arise. One such case is where, although an act of the accused constitutes a causa sine qua non of (or necessary condition for) the death of the victim, nevertheless the intervention of a third person may be regarded as the sole cause of the victim's death, thereby relieving the accused of criminal responsibility. Such intervention, if it has such an effect, has often been described by lawyers as a novus actus interveniens . We are aware that this time-honoured Latin term has been the subject of criticism. We are also aware that attempts have been made to translate it into English; though no simple translation has proved satisfactory, really because the Latin term has become a term of art which conveys to lawyers the crucial feature that there has not merely been an intervening act of another person, but that that act was so independent of the act of the accused that it should be regarded in law as the cause of the victim's death, to the exclusion of the act of the accused. At the risk of scholarly criticism, we shall for the purposes of this judgment continue to use the latin term. Now the whole subject of causation in the law has been the subject of a well-known and most distinguished treatise by Professors Hart and Honore. Passages from this book were cited to the learned judge, and were plainly relied upon by him; we, too, wish to express our indebtedness to it. It would be quite wrong for us to consider in this judgment the wider issues discussed in that work. But, for present purposes, the passage which is of most immediate relevance is to be found in Chapter XII, in which the learned authors consider the circumstances in which the intervention of a third person, not acting in concert with the accused, may have the effect of relieving the accused of criminal responsibility. The criterion which they suggest should be applied in such circumstances is whether the intervention is voluntary, i. e. whether it is ""free, deliberate and informed"". We resist the temptation of expressing the judicial opinion whether we find ourselves in complete agreement with that definition; though we certainly consider it to be broadly correct and supported by authority. Among the examples which the authors give of non-voluntary conduct, which is not effective to relieve the accused of responsibility, are two which are germane to the present case, viz. a reasonable act performed for the purpose of self-preservation, and an act done in performance of a legal duty. There can, we consider, be no doubt that a reasonable act performed for the purpose of self-preservation, being of course itself an act caused by the accused's own act, does not operate as a novus actus interveniens . If authority is needed for this almost self-evident proposition, it is to be found in such cases as R. v. Pitts (1842) C. & M. 284, and R. v. Curley (1909) 2 Cr. App. R. 96. In both these cases. the act performed for the purpose of self-preservation consisted of an act by the victim in attempting to escape from the violence of the accused, which in fact resulted in the victim's death. In each case it was held as a matter of law that, if the victim acted in a reasonable attempt to escape the violence of the accused, the death of the victim was caused by the act of the accused. Now one form of self-preservation is self-defence; for present purposes, we can see no distinction in principle between an attempt to escape the consequences of the accused's act, and a response which takes the form of self-defence. Furthermore, in our judgment, if a reasonable act of self-defence against the act of the accused causes the death of a third party, we can see no reason in principle why the act of self-defence, being an involuntary act caused by the act of the accused, should relieve the accused from criminal responsibility for the death of the third party. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that the accused will be guilty of the murder, or even of the manslaughter, of the third party; though in the majority of cases he is likely to be guilty at least of manslaughter. Whether he is guilty of murder or manslaughter will depend upon the question whether all the ingredients of the relevant offence have been proved; in particular, on a charge of murder, it will be necessary that the accused had the necessary intent, on the principles stated by the House of Lords in Hyam v. D. P. P . (1975) A C 55 . No English authority was cited to us, nor we think to the learned judge, in support of the proposition that an act done in the execution of a legal duty, again of course being an act itself caused by the act of the accused, does not operate as a novus actus interveniens . Before the judge, the cases relied on by the prosecution in support of this proposition were the two Pennsylvanian cases already referred to, Commonwealth v. Moyer and Commonwealth v. Almeida . However, since the case of Redline , neither of these cases can be regarded as authority in the State of Pennsylvania: Redline was not cited to the learned judge, we suspect because it is not referred to in Hart and Honore's Causation in the Law, almost certainly because the report of Redline was not available to the learned authors when their treatise went to the press. Even so, we agree with the learned judge that the proposition is sound in law, because as a matter of principle such an act cannot be regarded as a voluntary act independent of the wrongful act of the accused. A parallel may be drawn with the so-called ""rescue"" cases in the law of negligence, where a wrongdoer may be held liable in negligence to a third party who suffers injury in going to the rescue of a person who has been put in danger by the defendant's negligent act. Where, for example, a police officer in the execution of his duty acts to prevent a crime, or to apprehend a person suspected of a crime, the case is surely a fortiori . Of course, it is inherent in the requirement that the police officer, or other person, must be acting in the execution of his duty that his act should be reasonable in all the circumstances: see section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1967. Furthermore, once again we are only considering the issue of causation. If intervention by a third party in the execution of a legal duty, caused by the act of the accused, results in the death of the victim, the question whether the accused is guilty of the murder or manslaughter of the victim must depend on whether the necessary ingredients of the relevant offence have been proved against the accused, including in particular, in the case of murder, whether the accused had the necessary intent. The principles which we have stated are principles of law. This is plain from, for example, the case of Pitts , to which we have already referred. It follows that where, in any particular case, there is an issue concerned with what we have for convenience called novus actus interveniens , it will be appropriate for the judge to direct the jury in accordance with these principles. It does not however follow that it is accurate to state broadly that causation is a question of law. On the contrary, generally speaking causation is a question of fact for the jury. Thus in, for example, R. v. Towers (1874) 12 Cox C. C. 530, the accused struck a woman; she screamed loudly, and a child whom she was then nursing turned black in the face, and from that day until it died suffered from convulsions. The question whether the death of the child was caused by the act of the accused was left by the judge to the jury to decide as a question of fact. But that does not mean that there are no principles of law relating to causation, so that no directions on law are ever to be given to a jury on the question of causation. On the contrary, we have already pointed out one familiar direction which is given on causation, which is that the accused's act need not be the sole, or even the main, cause of the victim's death for his act to be held to have caused the death. Similarly, it was held by this court in the case of R. v. Blaue (1975) 6l Cr. App. R. 271 that ""It has long been the policy of the law that those who use violence on other people must take their victims as they find them. This in our judgment means the whole man, not just the physical man. It does not lie in the mouth of the assailant to say that his victim's religious belief which inhibited her from accepting certain kinds of treatment was unreasonable. The question for decision is what caused her death. The answer is the stab wound. The fact that the victim refused to stop this end coming about did not break the causal connection between the act and death. "" (See at page 274 per Lord Justice Lawton delivering the judgment of the court. ) This was plainly a statement of a principle of law. Likewise, in cases where there is an issue whether the act of the victim or of a third party constituted a novus actus interveniens , breaking the causal connection between the act of the accused and the death of the victim, it would be appropriate for the judge to direct the jury, of course in the most simple terms, in accordance with the legal principles which they have to apply. It would then fall to the jury to decide the relevant factual issues which, identified with reference to those legal principles, will lead to the conclusion whether or not the prosecution have established the guilt of the accused of the crime of which he is charged. It was submitted by Lord Gifford that any such conclusion would be contrary to the principles stated by the House of Lords in D. P. P. v. Stonehouse (1978) A. C. 55. In that case, which was concerned with an attempt to obtain property by deception, the trial judge directed the jury that certain conduct of the accused, if proved, would in law constitute the actus reus of an attempt. It was held by a majority of the House of Lords that the judge must leave it to the jury to decide on the evidence whether or not the accused had committed the alleged attempt, and the judge may not even direct the jury that, if certain acts are proved to their satisfaction, they must amount in law to an attempt. However that case simply exemplifies in a particular context the well-established principle that it is the function of the judge to direct the jury on the applicable law, and that he must not deprive the jury of their function to decide, on the law so stated to them, whether in fact the relevant offence has been committed. That principle does not conflict with what we have just stated with regard to the law of causation, which is consistent with the general approach that it is for the judge to direct the jury with reference to the relevant principles of law relating to causation, and then to leave it to the jury to decide, in the light of those principles, whether or not the relevant causal link has been established. There is however one further aspect of the present case to which we must advert. On the evidence, Gail Kinchen was not just an innocent bystander killed by a shot fired from the gun of a police officer who, acting in reasonable self-defence, fired his gun in response to a lethal attack by the appellant: though on those facts alone it would, in our opinion, have been open to the jury to convict the appellant of murder or manslaughter. But if, as the jury must have found to have occurred in the present case, the appellant used Gail Kinchen by force and against her will as a shield to protect him from any shots fired by the police, the effect is that he committed not one but two unlawful acts, both of which were dangerous  the act of firing at the police, and the act of holding Gail Kinchen as a shield in front of him when the police might well fire shots in his direction in self-defence. Either act could in our judgment, if on the principles we have stated it was held to cause the death of Gail Kinchen, constitute the actus reus of the manslaughter or, if the necessary-intent were established, murder of Gail Kinchen by the appellant, even though the shot which killed her was fired not by the appellant but by a police officer. In the light of these principles, we do not consider that any legitimate criticism can be made, on behalf of the appellant, of the direction given by the learned judge to the jury on the issue of causation in the present case. The most that can be said is that one statement by him was not, in our judgment, absolutely correct, viz. when he said: ""It is for me to decide as a question of law whether by his unlawful and deliberate acts the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death, but the answer to that question of law depends upon the findings of fact which you alone can decide.... "" Strictly speaking, it was for him to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law, leaving it for the jury to decide as a question of fact, on those applicable principles, whether the necessary causal link had been established. In practical terms, however, that is precisely what the learned judge did; and so his mis-statement (such as it was) of the legal position was of no materiality. Indeed, in stating the matters which the jury had to be sure about on causation, in order to convict the appellant, the judge was in our view generous to the appellant, in that he directed the jury that it was necessary that they should find both that he fired at the police officers and thereby caused them to fire back, and that he used Gail Kinchen as a shield by force and against her will. In our judgment, as we have already indicated, either of these acts could in the present case have constituted the necessary actus reus , whether of murder or manslaughter, causing Gail Kinchen's death. For these reasons, we are unable to accept Lord Gifford's argument based on the first ground of appeal. We turn finally to the third ground of appeal, which was that the learned judge erred in law in directing the jury that they could bring in an alternative verdict of manslaughter, because the requirement that the jury had to be satisfied that Gail Kinchen was being used by the appellant as a shield required the jury to apply a test which was the same as or very similar to the law of mens rea in murder. We can deal with this point quite shortly. In our judgment, even in circumstances such as these, the mens rea for murder and manslaughter are not the same. In the case of murder, the test (as stated by Lord Hailsham in Hyam v. D. P. P . (1975) A C 55 at pages 73-79) is ""a subjective test of what was the state of mind of the accused"". Before the act can be murder it must be ""aimed at someone"" and must in addition ""be an act committed with one of the following intentions, the test of which is always subjective to the actual defendant: ""(i) The intention to cause death; ""(ii) The intention to cause grievous bodily harm in the sense of that term explained in Smith (1961) A. C. 290, at page 335, i. e., really serious injury; "" (iii) Where the defendant knows that there is a serious risk that death or grievous bodily harm will ensue from his acts, and commits those acts deliberately and without lawful excuse, the intention to expose a potential victim to that risk as the result of those acts..... "" In manslaughter, however, it is sufficient in a case such as the present that the accused intentionally did an act which is both unlawful and, objectively considered, dangerous, and which in fact caused the victim's death. It must follow that the mens rea for each crime is different; and further that, on the evidence before them, it was open to the jury in the present case to conclude (if they thought it right to do so) that the appellant did not have any one of the three subjective intentions specified by Lord Hailsham as constituting the mens rea of murder, but did have the necessary mens rea for manslaughter. In our opinion, the learned judge could have been, and might well have been, criticised if he had not given the jury the opportunity of returning an alternative verdict of manslaughter of Gail Kinchen by the appellant (who, it must be remembered, was not represented by counsel during the closing stages of the trial). For these reasons, we reject the argument founded on the third ground of appeal. Accordingly, having held that all three grounds of appeal are not well-founded, the appeal against conviction will be dismissed. MR. ALLEN: My Lord, may I first say I appear here as Lord Gifford's junior. He is, I am afraid, absent elsewhere. I have spoken to Lord Gifford, and obviously we had some inkling as to which way your Lordships' judgment was going. We considered that it would be appropriate to apply for a certificate. I have spoken to your learned Registrar who informs me that this court cannot receive that application without Mr. Justice Farquharson LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: That is quite right. MR. ALLEN: May I simply make the application and invite your Lordships to adjourn. I understand that there is a date when the court could be reconstituted. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: What I think I would like to say is this. First of all, if we are to consider giving a certificate, we would be most obliged if you, with Lord Gifford, would formulate the question of law in writing and give Mr. Bowley a copy so that he could see it before any hearing takes place. MR. ALLEN: May I say that I had made a preliminary attempt at that, but one would obviously want to reconsider that in the light of what your Lordship has said. Certainly I will do that, and in fact I have given my learned friend a copy of the first draft. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: Secondly, the date we have provisionally in mind is Friday fortnight. MR. ALLEN: That is l8th February. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: I hope that is convenient, gentlemen, as a date, but that appears to be the only date possible for any such application. MR. ALLEN: I will take that date from the court back to my clerk. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: It is actually the only date when Mr. Justice Farquharson can be here. MR. ALLEN: Then there is no doubt about it at all. My Lords, perhaps the question of costs should be dealt with at that stage rather than today. Obviously we are legally aided in this matter. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: By all means if you wish it. Then we will meet again presumably, unless we hear to the contrary, on l8th February. MR. ALLEN: Yes, I am grateful.

C. appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ ____________________ (As approved by judge ) LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF : Mr. Justice Farquharson is absent on circuit; the judgment I am about to deliver is the judgment of the court, on which we are all agreed. On 27th March, 1981 the appellant, David Keith Pagett, was convicted, after a trial before Mr. Justice Park and a jury, on a number of counts relating to very serious offences  one count of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life; two counts of kidnapping; three counts of attempted murder; and one count of manslaughter. On each count he was sentenced to a term of 12 years' imprisonment concurrent. The evidence before the jury (which must have been substantially accepted by them) reveals a terrible story, with a tragic conclusion. The appellant, who was aged 31 and was separated from his wife, formed a relationship with a young girl called Gail Kinchen. In June 1980 Gail, who was then aged 16 and was six months pregnant by the appellant, left him after various domestic upsets and returned to the home of her mother and stepfather (Mr. and Mrs. Wood) in Brandon Park Road, Birmingham. On the evening of 11th June the appellant armed himself with his brother's shotgun and a number of cartridges and then went off in his sister's mini-car to look for Gail. He arrived at the Woods' house at 77 Brandon Park Road shortly after midnight. Mr. Wood answered the door, and found the appellant standing there with a shotgun held in both hands at an angle of about 45°. The appellant said: ""Now try your commando tricks. "" Mr. Wood slammed the door and ran through the house, out into the garden. He tried to push his wife into a lean-to shed. The appellant followed him. Mrs. Wood turned and saw him aiming his gun at her husband. She knocked the gun into the air; as she did so, she heard a bang. The appellant hit her on the head with the gun and she fell to the ground. The appellant then fired the gun at Mr. Wood as he fled over the garden fence a few feet away. Mr. Wood was shot in his rear left thigh; later over 100 pellets were removed from an area covering about nine inches. The appellant then frogmarched Mrs. Wood away; she was shouting for help as she went. He dragged her off to his car, asking where Gail was. Mrs. Wood directed him to the area where she and her husband had earlier dropped Gail to visit her friend Maria. The appellant still carried his shotgun, which he had reloaded. They arrived at the flat where Gail was, 15 Masefield Square. There were various people there, including Gail. The appellant lined them up, waving his shotgun at them. He hit Gail; as Mrs. Wood tried to grab the gun, he hit her with it in the ribs, knocking her to the floor. She was later found to have cracked or fractured ribs in her lower right chest. He called Gail, who was crying; she went out. He hit her again in the hall. There were thuds, as if she had fallen downstairs. He called for Mrs. Wood; she asked the others to call the police, and went out to join the appellant and Gail. The appellant drove off in the mini, with Mrs. Wood in the passenger seat and Gail sitting on her lap. He kept on hitting Gail. A police car came up; in it were two police officers who were on the lookout for the mini which was believed to contain an armed man wanted after a shooting incident. Gail signalled to it; the appellant threatened to kill both Gail and Mrs. Wood. Mrs. Wood got out on the passenger side; her evidence was that the appellant hit her on the head and knocked her out of the car. The appellant and Gail got out on the driver's side. Gail was hysterical, pleading with the appellant not to shoot Mrs. Wood. The officers got out of their car. The appellant threatened them with his gun, shouting: ""Back off. I am going to shoot you. "" The officers took cover in a nearby garden. The appellant then drove off with Gail. The officers returned to their car and followed the appellant's mini to Deelands Road, where it stopped. Two other officers had arrived at Deelands Road. The appellant and Gail got out of the mini; the appellant was carrying his shotgun, and Gail was walking in front of him. The appellant gestured with his gun at the officers and said: ""One more step pal, and I will let you have it. "" The appellant took Gail into a block of flats, No. 21 Deelands Road. No. 21 Deelands Road consisted of three floors, with two flats on each floor, opening out of a common central staircase. The appellant took Gail into his flat, No. 4, which was on the first floor. A number of police cars were by then parked opposite the flat, about 250 yards away, with their headlights on. A police officer, using a loud hailer, told the appellant to surrender his gun and come out. The appellant shouted to the police to turn their lights off or he would shoot at them and he would shoot the girl. Headlights were put out. The officer with the loud hailer again told the appellant to surrender his gun and come out. The appellant said that there was no way he would come out alive, he would shoot the girl and himself. The police told him that Mr. Wood was not badly hurt; he refused to come out, saying that he would get 17 years. He shouted for other car lights to be put out, and then fired his gun twice at the cars. They were hit but not badly damaged; some police officers were hit by pellets but not injured. Gail shouted out: ""Please move or he will shoot me. "" The police cars were moved. By then, police officers trained in the use of weapons and in the handling of ""hostage situations"" had arrived on the scene. They were split into three teams of two officers each. Two officers were stationed in the entrance to the block of flats; two others were stationed at the rear. The third pair of officers, D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards, entered the public part of the block of flats, in order to contain the appellant. D. C. Richards, using a loud hailer, called on the appellant to surrender. Shortly before 2 a. m., the appellant brought Gail out on to the balcony at the rear of his flat. He appeared to have a gun in his right hand, which was round her waist, and his left hand was round her neck. He shouted for the police to go or he would shoot; he said that if they did not leave he would kill her. Gail screamed: ""Get back or he will kill me. "" One of the officers called out to the appellant that he was surrounded by armed police, and should come out. The appellant shouted back and took the girl back into the flat. Meanwhile D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards had taken up position on the landing on the first floor, outside the adjacent doors of Nos. 3 and 4. There was only one light on in the common staircase, at the rear of the ground floor. The two officers were provided with bullet-proof jackets. The peephole in the front door of No. 4 was covered with mud by the police. There was no sound in the flat; the officers thought that the appellant and Gail might be asleep. Then the door was unlocked and opened. There was no light inside the flat. A shotgun barrel was poked out of the doorway. D. S. Sartain shouted that they were armed. The door was closed. Then it opened again. The shape of a woman (it must have been Gail) was in the doorway. The appellant had his left arm round her neck. The gun was in his right hand, pointing at the police officers. The appellant told them to get downstairs. The officers warned him several times that they were armed, and told the appellant to stand still and drop his gun. The appellant moved towards the officers pushing Gail in front of him. The two officers retreated to the top landing. It was very dark up there. D. S. Sartain walked along the landing, but could see nothing downstairs; he returned to D. C. Richards at the top of the stairs. He stood by the banister. D. C. Richards was on his right. They could see practically nothing. They could hear the appellant threatening to kill them. The appellant said to Gail: ""Talk to them, they don't think I mean it. "" Gail screamed: ""he is going to kill me. "" The appellant shouted out words to the effect that they were testing him and he was going to show them. A figure loomed round the corner on the upper flight of the stairs and started coming up towards the police officers. As D. C. Richards shouted to the appellant to stand still, the appellant fired his shotgun. D. S. Sartain fired two shots, and D. C. Richards fired four. There was another shotgun blast from the appellant. D. C. Richards fired two more shots, and D. S. Sartain one. The officers had fired their guns instinctively, not taking any particular aim. Gail shouted: ""You've shot me. You've shot me. "" As D. C. Richards was reloading his gun, D. S. Sartain ran down the stairs. D. C. Richards followed. They found the appellant sitting on the floor at the corner of the landing, with Gail sitting on top of him. The shotgun was on the floor: D. S. Sartain slid it out of the appellant's reach. Thirteen unused cartridges were later found in the appellant's pocket. It was plain that he had been using Gail as a shield as he went up the stairs, though the police officers could not see this. She received three bullet wounds, of which she later died. The appellant was unharmed by the bullets fired by the police officers. Very fortunately, the two police officers were unharmed by the shots fired by the appellant, which struck the banister and were deflected up towards the ceiling. At the trial, the appellant dismissed his counsel and defended himself. He called no evidence, but made a statement from the dock and a closing speech. We need not burden this judgment with his defence, which was plainly rejected by the jury. He was convicted by the jury of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life; of kidnapping Mrs. Wood and Gail Kinchen; of the attempted murder of Mr. Wood, D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards. He was acquitted of the murder of Gail, but convicted of her manslaughter. The present appeal against conviction is concerned only with the conviction of the manslaughter of Gail Kinchen. In a sense, it is academic; because, although there is an application that if the conviction of manslaughter should be quashed the sentence should be reviewed, it appears to the court to be inevitable, having regard to the extreme gravity of the other offences of which he was convicted, that the sentence of 12 years for the other offences should stand in any event. However, the grounds of appeal raise a question of law alone and for that reason the appeal has been referred directly to the full court. The question of law relates to the direction given by the learned judge to the jury in respect of the count of murder, and the alternative count of manslaughter, of Gail Kinchen. He directed the jury as follows. First he gave them the full definition of murder in the following terms: ""A person who unlawfully and deliberately causes the death of another person intending to kill or to do serious bodily harm to that person is guilty of murder, and so in the present case the prosecution have to prove beyond all reasonable doubt two things: first that by his unlawful and deliberate acts the defendant caused Gail's death or was a cause of her death. Secondly, in doing those acts he intended to kill or to do serious bodily harm to her. "" Next he considered with the jury the two acts of the appellant which the prosecution contended were unlawful and deliberate and which caused her death, viz. (1) the firing of the gun at the police officers (which he explained could constitute an assault), and (2) the physical force applied to Gail so that her body could be used as a shield (which again he explained could constitute an assault). Then the learned judge turned to the question of causation. On this, he directed the jury as follows: ""Now, Members of the Jury, if you were satisfied that he did those 2 unlawful and deliberate acts, the question now becomes whether by those acts he caused or was a cause of Gail's death. It sometimes happens that difficult questions arise when a jury has to decide whether something is a cause of the death of the victim. This is just such a case. In those circumstances it is for me to decide as a question of law whether by his unlawful and deliberate acts the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death, but the answer to that question of law depends upon findings of fact which you alone can decide, and accordingly I have to direct you that if you find the facts I am about to mention proved beyond all reasonable doubt, then the defendant would have caused or been a cause of Gail's death. It might help you if I explain that the act of an accused person on the charge of murder need not be the sole cause or even the main cause of the death of the victim. It is not necessary to prove actual physical violence on the victim by the accused, but let me illustrate that point by an old case which came before the courts years and years ago. A man quarrelled with the woman he was living with. He ran towards her in order to hit her but he did not succeed in doing so. In fear or in retreat from the attack she jumped or fell from a window and was killed. The courts held that he, although he had not laid a finger on her, was a cause of her death. ""I turn now to the question whether the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death. I am going to mention the facts. If you are sure that the following facts have been proved beyond all reasonable doubt, then the defendant would have caused or would have been a cause of Gail's death. First of all, that he fired the shot-gun deliberately at the police officers before any shot was fired by them. In other words, sure that he fired first. Secondly that his act in firing at the police officers caused them to fire back with the result that bullets from their weapons shot Gail and caused her death. Next, that in firing back for that reason the police acted reasonably either by way of self-defence or in the performance of their duty as police officers, or both. I will explain that in a little more detail in a moment. Lastly, that from the beginning to the end of the firing Gail was being used against her will and by force by the defendant as a shield to protect him from any shots fired by the police. If you are not sure about any of those matters, acquit him, and you will acquit him of course because the chain which links his deliberate and unlawful acts with Gail's death will have been broken. "" Having directed the jury on causation in those terms, he then turned to the question whether the police officers fired at the appellant because they had been fired at by him, and if so, whether they acted reasonably; and in doing so, he explained to the jury both the law relating to self-defence and, in relation to the question whether the police acted reasonably in the performance of their duties as police officers, the legal principle that a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of an offender or a suspected offender. Finally, in connection with the count of murder, he gave the following direction on the necessary intent (plainly founded upon Hyam v. D. P. P. (1975) A C 55 ): ""Members of the jury, if you were satisfied by the evidence so that you felt sure that the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death, the prosecution must next satisfy you on the charge of murder that by his deliberate and unlawful acts he intended either to kill Gail or to cause her really serious bodily harm. In other words, they must satisfy you that he acted with a willingness in his mind to produce, as a consequence of what he did, either the death of Gail or serious bodily injury to her. ""The prosecution will have established the necessary intent if they satisfy you that in doing what he did, he knew that it was probable that his unlawful acts would result in Gail's death or in really serious bodily harm to her. ""I have used the word 'knew'. Another word which expresses equally well the state of mind which has to be proved is 'foresaw'; he foresaw that it was probable that his unlawful acts would result in Gail's death or in really serious bodily harm to her. "" Having directed the jury on the count of murder, the learned judge turned to the alternative count of manslaughter. Here he gave a direction (obviously founded upon D. P. P. v. Newbury (1977) A C 500 ) as follows: ""A person would be guilty of manslaughter if he intentionally did an act which was unlawful and dangerous, and that act caused the death of another person. For this purpose  the purpose of the charge of manslaughter  the unlawful act must be such as all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to the risk of some harm resulting from it, albeit not serious harm. On a charge of manslaughter it is not necessary to prove that the accused knew that his act or acts were unlawful, nor is it necessary to prove that he knew his acts were dangerous. ""So if you were sure in this case that the two unlawful acts  the assault on the police by firing at them and the assault on Gail  considered in the way I have described, caused Gail's death and that they were acts which all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise would subject Gail to the risk of some harm, then the defendant would be guilty of manslaughter. "" It is difficult to imagine a more lucid and careful summing-up on these topics, in a form designed to be as fair as possible to the appellant and at the same time as helpful as possible to the jury. The criticism of the summing-up, advanced in this court by Lord Gifford (to whose argument we are much indebted), was directed primarily to the direction to the jury on causation, which was of course equally applicable to the count of murder and the alternative count of manslaughter. The three specific points raised on behalf of the appellant were as follows (we quote from the grounds of appeal): (1) The learned judge erred in law in directing that the jury must as a matter of law find that the appellant caused the death of the deceased, if they were satisfied as to the four matters of fact which he sets out. The learned judge ought rather to have left it to the jury to determine as an issue of fact whether the defendant's act in firing at the police officers was a substantial, or operative, or imputable, cause of the death of the deceased. (2) In the alternative, if the learned judge was correct in himself determining as a matter of law what facts would amount to causation of the death by the appellant, he ought to have held that the appellant had not in the circumstances of this case caused the death of the deceased. The learned judge, in directing himself upon the law, ought to have held that where the act which immediately-resulted in fatal injury was the act of another party, albeit in legitimate self-defence, then the ensuing death was too remote or indirect to be imputed to the original aggressor. (3) If the learned judge's direction as to causation was correct, then he erred in law in directing the jury that they could bring in an alternative verdict of manslaughter. The requirement that the jury had to be satisfied that the deceased was being used by the appellant as a shield required the jury to apply a test which was the same or very similar to the test of mens rea in murder. The argument addressed to this court by Lord Gifford on behalf of the appellant was concentrated primarily on the first and second grounds of appeal, and was as presented concerned with the issue of causation. We find it convenient to deal first with the second ground of appeal. We do so because this ground raises a particular, defined, issue, founded upon certain United States authorities; furthermore, having considered those authorities and the submission founded upon them, we are satisfied that this ground of appeal is not well-founded, and we feel that it would be more satisfactory if we were to deal with this point before turning to consider the more fundamental question raised on the first ground of appeal. The United States authorities cited to us, which reflect some diversity of judicial opinion, were concerned with the question whether an accused person could be convicted of the murder or manslaughter of a person by shooting, where the fatal shot was fired not by the accused but by some other person. In Commonwealth v. Almeida 362 Pa. 596 (1949), a case concerned with a robbery in the course of which shots were exchanged with police officers and a police officer was killed, the accused (one of the robbers) was convicted of the murder of the police officer. It was held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, following dicta in the earlier case of Commonwealth v. Moyer 357 Pa. l8l (1947), that it was immaterial whether the shot which killed the police officer was fired by one of the robbers or by a police officer, the circumstances being such that the police officers were acting both in justifiable self-defence and in the performance of their duty. In these circumstances, even if the fatal shot was fired by one of the police officers, ""The felonious acts of the robbers in firing shots at the policemen, well knowing that their fire would be returned, as it should have been, was (sic) the proximate cause of Officer Ingling's death"". The point was, as appears from this brief quotation, considered by the court to raise a question of causation. The decision was subsequently followed in Commonwealth v. Thomas 382 Pa. 639. However, in Commonwealth v. Redline 137 Atl. (2d. ) (Pa. ) (1958), the earlier case of Thomas was overruled, and Almeida itself, although not formally overruled, was plainly disapproved by the majority of the court. In Redline , it fell to the court to consider a case of armed robbery which gave rise to a gun battle between the robbers and police officers, in the course of which one of the robbers was killed by a bullet fired by one of the police officers. A majority of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held (following a number of earlier authorities, including in particular Commonwealth v. Campbell 89 Mass, 541 (1863), Butler v. The People 125 Ill. 64l (1888), and Commonwealth v. Moore 121 Ky. 97 (1905)) that the conviction of one of the robbers for the murder of the deceased robber could not stand, the fatal shot not having been fired by him but by another person with whom he was not acting in concert. It was on this case in particular, and on the earlier cases cited in it, that Lord Gifford founded his argument in the present case. Examination of the reasoning of the majority of the court in Redline shows, however, that the decision provides no useful guidance to an English court today. The point is that the reasoning of the Pennsylvanian court was concerned with the scope of the felony murder doctrine which, since the abolition of constructive malice in murder by section 1 of the Homicide Act, 1957, forms no part of English law. The approach of the majority of the Pennsylvanian court is amply illustrated by the following passage taken from page 476 of the report: ""In adjudging a felony-murder, it is to be remembered at all times that the thing which is imputed to a felon for a killing incidental to his felony is malice and not the act of killing . The mere coincidence of homicide and felony is not enough to satisfy the requirement of the felony-murder doctrine.... ""The legal situation which for years obtained in this State in cases of felony-murder was aptly epitomized by Mr. Justice Parker in Commonwealth v. Guida 341 Pa. 505, 308, 19 A. 2d. 100, as follows: '.... if a person killed another in doing or attempting to do another act, and if the act done or attempted to be done was a felony, the killing was murder. There was thus supplied the state of mind called malice which was essential to constitute murder. The malice of the initial offense attaches to whatever else the criminal may do in connection therewith. '.... And so, until the decision of this court in Commonwealth v. Almeida ...., the rule which was uniformly followed, whether by express statement or by implication, was that in order to convict for felony-murder, the killing must have been done by the defendant or by an accomplice or confederate or by one acting in furtherance of the felonious undertaking . "" It was this principle, reflected in the earlier cases, which was reaffirmed in the case of Redline. It at once becomes apparent that the case of Redline , and the earlier cases cited in it in support of the conclusion in that case, are of no assistance to an English court concerned with the English law of murder, of which the felony-murder doctrine forms no part. Even so, it was pressed upon us by Lord Gifford that there either was, or should be, a comparable rule of English law, whereby, as a matter of policy, no man should be convicted of homicide (or, we imagine, any crime of violence to another person) unless he himself, or another person acting in concert with him, fired the shot (or, we imagine, struck the blow) which was the immediate cause of the victim's death (or injury). No English authority was cited to us in support of any such proposition, and we know of none. So far as we are aware, there is no such rule in English law; and, in the absence of any doctrine of constructive malice, we can see no basis in principle for any such rule in English law. Lord Gifford urged upon us that, in a case where the accused did not, for example, fire the shot which was the immediate cause of the victim's death, he will inevitably have committed some lesser crime, and that it would be sufficient that he should be convicted of that lesser crime. So, on the facts of the present case, it would be enough that the appellant was convicted of the crime of attempted murder of the two police officers, D. S. Sartain and D. C. Richards. We see no force in this submission. In point of fact, it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which it would manifestly be inadequate for the accused merely to be convicted of a lesser offence; for example, a man besieged by armed terrorists in a house might attempt to make his escape by forcing some other person to act as a shield, knowing full well that that person would in all probability be shot, and possibly killed, in consequence. For that man merely to be convicted of an assault would, if the person he used as a shield were to be shot and killed, surely be inadequate in the circumstances; we can see no reason why he should not be convicted at least of manslaughter. But in any event there is, so far as we can discern, no basis of legal principle in Lord Gifford's submission. We are therefore unable to accept it. In our judgment, the question whether an accused person can be held guilty of homicide, either murder or manslaughter, of a victim the immediate cause of whose death is the act of another person must be determined on the ordinary principles of causation, uninhibited by any such rule of policy as that for which Lord Gifford has contended. We therefore reject the second ground of appeal. We turn to the first ground of appeal, which is that the learned judge erred in directing the jury that it was for him to decide as a matter of law whether by his unlawful and deliberate acts the appellant caused or was a cause of Gail Kinchen's death. It is right to observe that this direction of the learned judge followed upon a discussion with counsel, in the absence of the jury; though the appellant, having dismissed his own counsel, was for this purpose without legal representation. In the course of this discussion, counsel for the prosecution referred the learned judge to a passage in Professor Smith and Professor Hogan's Criminal Law, 4th ed., at page 272, which reads as follows: ""Causation is a question of both fact and law. D's act cannot be held to be the cause of an event if the event would have occurred without it. The act, that is, must be a sine qua non of the event and whether it is so is a question of fact. But there are many-acts which are sine qua non of a homicide and yet are not either in law, or in ordinary parlance, the cause of it. If I invite P to dinner and he is run over and killed on the way, my invitation may be a sine qua non of his death, but no one would say I killed him and I have not caused his death in law. Whether a particular act which is a sine qua non of an alleged actus reus is also a cause of it is a question of law. Where the facts are admitted the judge may direct the jury that a particular act did, or did not, cause a particular result. "" There follows a reference to R. v. Jordan (1956) 40 Cr. App. E. 152. For the appellant, Lord Gifford criticised the statement of the learned authors that ""Whether a particular act which is a sine qua non of an alleged actus reus is also a cause of it is a question of law"". He submitted that that question had to be answered by the jury as a question of fact. In our view, with all respect, both the passage in Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law, and Lord Gifford's criticism of it, are over-simplifications of a complex matter. We have no intention of embarking in this judgment on a dissertation of the nature of causation, or indeed of considering any matters other than those which are germane to the decision of the issues now before us. Problems of causation have troubled philosophers and lawyers throughout the ages; and it would be rash in the extreme for us to trespass beyond the boundaries of our immediate problem. Our comments should therefore be understood to be confined not merely to the criminal law, but to cases of homicide (and possibly also other crimes of violence to the person); and it must be emphasised that the problem of causation in the present case is specifically concerned with the intervention of another person (here one of the police officers) whose act was the immediate cause of the death of the victim, Gail Kinchen. In cases of homicide, it is rarely necessary to give the jury any direction on causation as such. Of course, a necessary ingredient of the crimes of murder and manslaughter is that the accused has by his act caused the victim's death. But how the victim came by his death is usually not in dispute. What is in dispute is more likely to be some other matter: for example, the identity of the person who committed the act which indisputably caused the victim's death; or whether the accused had the necessary intent; or whether the accused acted in self-defence, or was provoked. Even where it is necessary to direct the jury's minds to the question of causation, it is usually enough to direct them simply that in law the accused's act need not be the sole cause, or even the main cause, of the victim's death, it being enough that his act contributed significantly to that result. It is right to observe in passing, however, that even this simple direction is a direction of law relating to causation, on the basis of which the jury are bound to act in concluding whether the prosecution has established, as a matter of fact, that the accused's act did in this sense cause the victim's death. Occasionally, however, a specific issue of causation may arise. One such case is where, although an act of the accused constitutes a causa sine qua non of (or necessary condition for) the death of the victim, nevertheless the intervention of a third person may be regarded as the sole cause of the victim's death, thereby relieving the accused of criminal responsibility. Such intervention, if it has such an effect, has often been described by lawyers as a novus actus interveniens . We are aware that this time-honoured Latin term has been the subject of criticism. We are also aware that attempts have been made to translate it into English; though no simple translation has proved satisfactory, really because the Latin term has become a term of art which conveys to lawyers the crucial feature that there has not merely been an intervening act of another person, but that that act was so independent of the act of the accused that it should be regarded in law as the cause of the victim's death, to the exclusion of the act of the accused. At the risk of scholarly criticism, we shall for the purposes of this judgment continue to use the latin term. Now the whole subject of causation in the law has been the subject of a well-known and most distinguished treatise by Professors Hart and Honore. Passages from this book were cited to the learned judge, and were plainly relied upon by him; we, too, wish to express our indebtedness to it. It would be quite wrong for us to consider in this judgment the wider issues discussed in that work. But, for present purposes, the passage which is of most immediate relevance is to be found in Chapter XII, in which the learned authors consider the circumstances in which the intervention of a third person, not acting in concert with the accused, may have the effect of relieving the accused of criminal responsibility. The criterion which they suggest should be applied in such circumstances is whether the intervention is voluntary, i. e. whether it is ""free, deliberate and informed"". We resist the temptation of expressing the judicial opinion whether we find ourselves in complete agreement with that definition; though we certainly consider it to be broadly correct and supported by authority. Among the examples which the authors give of non-voluntary conduct, which is not effective to relieve the accused of responsibility, are two which are germane to the present case, viz. a reasonable act performed for the purpose of self-preservation, and an act done in performance of a legal duty. There can, we consider, be no doubt that a reasonable act performed for the purpose of self-preservation, being of course itself an act caused by the accused's own act, does not operate as a novus actus interveniens . If authority is needed for this almost self-evident proposition, it is to be found in such cases as R. v. Pitts (1842) C. & M. 284, and R. v. Curley (1909) 2 Cr. App. R. 96. In both these cases. the act performed for the purpose of self-preservation consisted of an act by the victim in attempting to escape from the violence of the accused, which in fact resulted in the victim's death. In each case it was held as a matter of law that, if the victim acted in a reasonable attempt to escape the violence of the accused, the death of the victim was caused by the act of the accused. Now one form of self-preservation is self-defence; for present purposes, we can see no distinction in principle between an attempt to escape the consequences of the accused's act, and a response which takes the form of self-defence. Furthermore, in our judgment, if a reasonable act of self-defence against the act of the accused causes the death of a third party, we can see no reason in principle why the act of self-defence, being an involuntary act caused by the act of the accused, should relieve the accused from criminal responsibility for the death of the third party. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that the accused will be guilty of the murder, or even of the manslaughter, of the third party; though in the majority of cases he is likely to be guilty at least of manslaughter. Whether he is guilty of murder or manslaughter will depend upon the question whether all the ingredients of the relevant offence have been proved; in particular, on a charge of murder, it will be necessary that the accused had the necessary intent, on the principles stated by the House of Lords in Hyam v. D. P. P . (1975) A C 55 . No English authority was cited to us, nor we think to the learned judge, in support of the proposition that an act done in the execution of a legal duty, again of course being an act itself caused by the act of the accused, does not operate as a novus actus interveniens . Before the judge, the cases relied on by the prosecution in support of this proposition were the two Pennsylvanian cases already referred to, Commonwealth v. Moyer and Commonwealth v. Almeida . However, since the case of Redline , neither of these cases can be regarded as authority in the State of Pennsylvania: Redline was not cited to the learned judge, we suspect because it is not referred to in Hart and Honore's Causation in the Law, almost certainly because the report of Redline was not available to the learned authors when their treatise went to the press. Even so, we agree with the learned judge that the proposition is sound in law, because as a matter of principle such an act cannot be regarded as a voluntary act independent of the wrongful act of the accused. A parallel may be drawn with the so-called ""rescue"" cases in the law of negligence, where a wrongdoer may be held liable in negligence to a third party who suffers injury in going to the rescue of a person who has been put in danger by the defendant's negligent act. Where, for example, a police officer in the execution of his duty acts to prevent a crime, or to apprehend a person suspected of a crime, the case is surely a fortiori . Of course, it is inherent in the requirement that the police officer, or other person, must be acting in the execution of his duty that his act should be reasonable in all the circumstances: see section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1967. Furthermore, once again we are only considering the issue of causation. If intervention by a third party in the execution of a legal duty, caused by the act of the accused, results in the death of the victim, the question whether the accused is guilty of the murder or manslaughter of the victim must depend on whether the necessary ingredients of the relevant offence have been proved against the accused, including in particular, in the case of murder, whether the accused had the necessary intent. The principles which we have stated are principles of law. This is plain from, for example, the case of Pitts , to which we have already referred. It follows that where, in any particular case, there is an issue concerned with what we have for convenience called novus actus interveniens , it will be appropriate for the judge to direct the jury in accordance with these principles. It does not however follow that it is accurate to state broadly that causation is a question of law. On the contrary, generally speaking causation is a question of fact for the jury. Thus in, for example, R. v. Towers (1874) 12 Cox C. C. 530, the accused struck a woman; she screamed loudly, and a child whom she was then nursing turned black in the face, and from that day until it died suffered from convulsions. The question whether the death of the child was caused by the act of the accused was left by the judge to the jury to decide as a question of fact. But that does not mean that there are no principles of law relating to causation, so that no directions on law are ever to be given to a jury on the question of causation. On the contrary, we have already pointed out one familiar direction which is given on causation, which is that the accused's act need not be the sole, or even the main, cause of the victim's death for his act to be held to have caused the death. Similarly, it was held by this court in the case of R. v. Blaue (1975) 6l Cr. App. R. 271 that ""It has long been the policy of the law that those who use violence on other people must take their victims as they find them. This in our judgment means the whole man, not just the physical man. It does not lie in the mouth of the assailant to say that his victim's religious belief which inhibited her from accepting certain kinds of treatment was unreasonable. The question for decision is what caused her death. The answer is the stab wound. The fact that the victim refused to stop this end coming about did not break the causal connection between the act and death. "" (See at page 274 per Lord Justice Lawton delivering the judgment of the court. ) This was plainly a statement of a principle of law. Likewise, in cases where there is an issue whether the act of the victim or of a third party constituted a novus actus interveniens , breaking the causal connection between the act of the accused and the death of the victim, it would be appropriate for the judge to direct the jury, of course in the most simple terms, in accordance with the legal principles which they have to apply. It would then fall to the jury to decide the relevant factual issues which, identified with reference to those legal principles, will lead to the conclusion whether or not the prosecution have established the guilt of the accused of the crime of which he is charged. It was submitted by Lord Gifford that any such conclusion would be contrary to the principles stated by the House of Lords in D. P. P. v. Stonehouse (1978) A. C. 55. In that case, which was concerned with an attempt to obtain property by deception, the trial judge directed the jury that certain conduct of the accused, if proved, would in law constitute the actus reus of an attempt. It was held by a majority of the House of Lords that the judge must leave it to the jury to decide on the evidence whether or not the accused had committed the alleged attempt, and the judge may not even direct the jury that, if certain acts are proved to their satisfaction, they must amount in law to an attempt. However that case simply exemplifies in a particular context the well-established principle that it is the function of the judge to direct the jury on the applicable law, and that he must not deprive the jury of their function to decide, on the law so stated to them, whether in fact the relevant offence has been committed. That principle does not conflict with what we have just stated with regard to the law of causation, which is consistent with the general approach that it is for the judge to direct the jury with reference to the relevant principles of law relating to causation, and then to leave it to the jury to decide, in the light of those principles, whether or not the relevant causal link has been established. There is however one further aspect of the present case to which we must advert. On the evidence, Gail Kinchen was not just an innocent bystander killed by a shot fired from the gun of a police officer who, acting in reasonable self-defence, fired his gun in response to a lethal attack by the appellant: though on those facts alone it would, in our opinion, have been open to the jury to convict the appellant of murder or manslaughter. But if, as the jury must have found to have occurred in the present case, the appellant used Gail Kinchen by force and against her will as a shield to protect him from any shots fired by the police, the effect is that he committed not one but two unlawful acts, both of which were dangerous  the act of firing at the police, and the act of holding Gail Kinchen as a shield in front of him when the police might well fire shots in his direction in self-defence. Either act could in our judgment, if on the principles we have stated it was held to cause the death of Gail Kinchen, constitute the actus reus of the manslaughter or, if the necessary-intent were established, murder of Gail Kinchen by the appellant, even though the shot which killed her was fired not by the appellant but by a police officer. In the light of these principles, we do not consider that any legitimate criticism can be made, on behalf of the appellant, of the direction given by the learned judge to the jury on the issue of causation in the present case. The most that can be said is that one statement by him was not, in our judgment, absolutely correct, viz. when he said: ""It is for me to decide as a question of law whether by his unlawful and deliberate acts the defendant caused or was a cause of Gail's death, but the answer to that question of law depends upon the findings of fact which you alone can decide.... "" Strictly speaking, it was for him to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law, leaving it for the jury to decide as a question of fact, on those applicable principles, whether the necessary causal link had been established. In practical terms, however, that is precisely what the learned judge did; and so his mis-statement (such as it was) of the legal position was of no materiality. Indeed, in stating the matters which the jury had to be sure about on causation, in order to convict the appellant, the judge was in our view generous to the appellant, in that he directed the jury that it was necessary that they should find both that he fired at the police officers and thereby caused them to fire back, and that he used Gail Kinchen as a shield by force and against her will. In our judgment, as we have already indicated, either of these acts could in the present case have constituted the necessary actus reus , whether of murder or manslaughter, causing Gail Kinchen's death. For these reasons, we are unable to accept Lord Gifford's argument based on the first ground of appeal. We turn finally to the third ground of appeal, which was that the learned judge erred in law in directing the jury that they could bring in an alternative verdict of manslaughter, because the requirement that the jury had to be satisfied that Gail Kinchen was being used by the appellant as a shield required the jury to apply a test which was the same as or very similar to the law of mens rea in murder. We can deal with this point quite shortly. In our judgment, even in circumstances such as these, the mens rea for murder and manslaughter are not the same. In the case of murder, the test (as stated by Lord Hailsham in Hyam v. D. P. P . (1975) A C 55 at pages 73-79) is ""a subjective test of what was the state of mind of the accused"". Before the act can be murder it must be ""aimed at someone"" and must in addition ""be an act committed with one of the following intentions, the test of which is always subjective to the actual defendant: ""(i) The intention to cause death; ""(ii) The intention to cause grievous bodily harm in the sense of that term explained in Smith (1961) A. C. 290, at page 335, i. e., really serious injury; "" (iii) Where the defendant knows that there is a serious risk that death or grievous bodily harm will ensue from his acts, and commits those acts deliberately and without lawful excuse, the intention to expose a potential victim to that risk as the result of those acts..... "" In manslaughter, however, it is sufficient in a case such as the present that the accused intentionally did an act which is both unlawful and, objectively considered, dangerous, and which in fact caused the victim's death. It must follow that the mens rea for each crime is different; and further that, on the evidence before them, it was open to the jury in the present case to conclude (if they thought it right to do so) that the appellant did not have any one of the three subjective intentions specified by Lord Hailsham as constituting the mens rea of murder, but did have the necessary mens rea for manslaughter. In our opinion, the learned judge could have been, and might well have been, criticised if he had not given the jury the opportunity of returning an alternative verdict of manslaughter of Gail Kinchen by the appellant (who, it must be remembered, was not represented by counsel during the closing stages of the trial). For these reasons, we reject the argument founded on the third ground of appeal. Accordingly, having held that all three grounds of appeal are not well-founded, the appeal against conviction will be dismissed. MR. ALLEN: My Lord, may I first say I appear here as Lord Gifford's junior. He is, I am afraid, absent elsewhere. I have spoken to Lord Gifford, and obviously we had some inkling as to which way your Lordships' judgment was going. We considered that it would be appropriate to apply for a certificate. I have spoken to your learned Registrar who informs me that this court cannot receive that application without Mr. Justice Farquharson LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: That is quite right. MR. ALLEN: May I simply make the application and invite your Lordships to adjourn. I understand that there is a date when the court could be reconstituted. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: What I think I would like to say is this. First of all, if we are to consider giving a certificate, we would be most obliged if you, with Lord Gifford, would formulate the question of law in writing and give Mr. Bowley a copy so that he could see it before any hearing takes place. MR. ALLEN: May I say that I had made a preliminary attempt at that, but one would obviously want to reconsider that in the light of what your Lordship has said. Certainly I will do that, and in fact I have given my learned friend a copy of the first draft. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: Secondly, the date we have provisionally in mind is Friday fortnight. MR. ALLEN: That is l8th February. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: I hope that is convenient, gentlemen, as a date, but that appears to be the only date possible for any such application. MR. ALLEN: I will take that date from the court back to my clerk. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: It is actually the only date when Mr. Justice Farquharson can be here. MR. ALLEN: Then there is no doubt about it at all. My Lords, perhaps the question of costs should be dealt with at that stage rather than today. Obviously we are legally aided in this matter. LORD JUSTICE ROBERT GOFF: By all means if you wish it. Then we will meet again presumably, unless we hear to the contrary, on l8th February. MR. ALLEN: Yes, I am grateful."

Displeased by the actions of the driver of the Nova car, Mark Sharp overtook, making a rude gesture as he did so. Shortly afterwards he parked his car in High Town Road near a laundrette. The Nova car pulled up beside him and the four Asian occupants, Shahid the driver, Mr Jomir Miah, Mr Forid Miah and Mr Abdul Tahid, got out and confronted Sharp. An argument ensued and one of the four who had been travelling in the Nova car returned to the car to make a call on a mobile telephone. Shortly afterwards, two other Asians, Mr Rejan Uddin and Mr Abdul Abbadin, and possibly two others, joined the four occupants of the Nova car. They were obviously friends. The two new arrivals appeared to Mr Hughes, a witness, to be older and bigger than the original four. Sharp and the six Asians were all on the pavement and close to a wall. Mr Hughes turned to go back to his car and had hardly taken a step or two when hearing a noise he turned and saw that the six Asians were attacking Sharp. Three of them appeared to be using weapons made out of the bottom half of a snooker cue. He saw Sharp being hit around the head and generally all over the body. The three who did not have weapons were punching and kicking Sharp. As he was being hit around the head, Sharp fell to his knees but the attackers carried on until he fell down completely and was lying still. The six attackers then ran off to their car. The attack had lasted, he thought, 30 seconds. He saw no attempt by Sharp to strike at the attackers or deliver any blows. His impression was that all six attackers were taking part in the violence but he could not say which of them used weapons or which of them kicked or punched. Mr Tatham who owned the laundrette also witnessed the attack. He had come from a shop about two doors away and noticed an argument with five or six young Asian males standing around a white man who was swearing. The Asians then seemed calm and standing around. From just inside the laundrette he saw them on the opposite side of the road and, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a man to his left strike a blow at Sharp who went down. As he went down all the others converged on him and as they did so he heard someone shout: “Stab him!” He added: “When Mr Sharp was in a crouching position they all converged. They were fighting to get one in. There was kicking and everything, hitting and kicking. When Sharp was lying down the group was hitting and kicking.” He heard the words “Stab him” as Sharp went down after the first hit had reduced him to a crouching position and before he was on the ground. All the young Asians were involved together but when they ran off some ran to the right and some to the left. He made a 999 call at 17.52 hrs. in which he said that a man had been stabbed. Another witness, Mr Harper, described how four or five Asians were arguing with Sharp: “They were pulling things out of their sleeves and started to hit him. They looked like poles and bars. I think they all had a weapon like a crome bar, looked like, and one looked like a wooden bar about two feet long. ... They started hitting the man, pushing him to the floor and beating him. I could see all the blood. I thought about five were involved in the attack.” He also said: “All of them started pushing him about, knocked him to the floor and kicked and beat him”. He added that he did not see Sharp use any violence: “He had no chance really. He tried to defend himself, but did not get much chance.” There were several other witnesses to the attack, including a ten year old boy, Ian Smith, watching from the window of a flat overlooking the scene. One of the newcomers, he thought, took a big stick from his sleeve which looked like part of a snooker cue and he started hitting the white man (who was Sharp): “He didn’t make him go down and the white man turned and looked around. Then another Asian kicked him. He banged off the railings of the church and fell down. Then all of them just started hitting him, stamping on him and kicking him. All the men who came down the road had sticks as well. These sticks were all the same as the first stick that I just described. When the white man fell to the ground, the Asians with sticks hit him with their sticks. Others were stamping on him and kicking him. All of them were attacking him. No-one was trying to stop what was happening.” He thought he saw about five sticks. After the attackers had departed, Mark Sharp was found to be seriously injured. He died three days later. Five of those who were said to have taken part in the attack were arrested and charged with the murder of Mark Sharp. They were: the appellant Rejan Uddin, Abdul Shahid, Forid Miah, Jomir Miah and Abdul Tahid. Abdul Abbadin could not be found. The five who were charged were tried in the Crown Court at Luton before Mr Justice Dyson and a jury. On 11th July 1996 the appellant Rejan Uddin and Abdul Tahid were convicted of murder and sentenced to custody for life. Jomir Miah, Abdul Shahid and Forid Miah were acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. Forid Miah and Abdul Shahid were sentenced to four years imprisonment. Jomir Miah to four years detention in a Young Offenders Institution. Mark Sharp died from injuries to his head. The most serious, and the cause of his death, was a stab wound delivered with moderate force near the base of the skull and which penetrated the brain but there were two other injuries to the head caused by a blow with a blunt instrument struck with mild to moderate force which might have been sufficient to cause unconsciousness and could not be ruled out as contributory causes of death but neither of the two doctors who gave evidence could state that they had actually done so. The blow with the knife was delivered by Abdul Tahid who apparently produced a flick knife from his pocket as he joined in the attack. Apart from the shout of “Stab him” heard by the witness Mr Tatham, there was no evidence that the other defendants knew that Abdul Tahid had a knife and all denied doing so. The three defendants convicted of manslaughter all gave evidence; the appellant did not. The defendants convicted of manslaughter were of good character and apparently the appellant was not. One of the grounds of appeal advanced by Mr Amlot Q.C. for Uddin was that the judge in giving the jury the appropriate direction on the significance of the evidence of the good character of the defendants who testified, did so in a manner which unnecessarily drew attention to the fact that he gave no such direction in the case of the appellant. It was said that the manner of his direction would have been likely to signal to the jury that the appellant was not of good character. In our view the criticism of the learned judge’s summing-up in this respect is unjustified and we find it unnecessary to say more of this ground of appeal. Whilst the jury were deliberating on their verdicts, they reported to the judge that four of them had received telephone calls from a caller or callers who, when the telephone was answered, said nothing. It was submitted to the judge that he should discharge the jury. The judge’s handling of the situation was faultless and he declined to do so. Again we find it unnecessary to deal in detail with the submission to us that the appellant’s conviction was unsafe because the judge ought to have discharged the jury. It is sufficient to say that he gave the jury appropriate warnings and guidance and that no basis was shown on which we could review the exercise of his discretion. Accordingly we reject this ground of appeal. We now come to the main grounds of appeal which were: (a) That the verdict in the appellant’s case was inconsistent with the verdicts of manslaughter in the cases of the three co-defendants (Abdul Shahid, Jomir Miah, Forid Miah) who were acquitted of murder. The appellant was in no different position from those co-defendants. In each case there was no evidence that the defendant knew that a fourth defendant (Abdul Tahid) had a knife or would use it. A single stab wound to the head was the cause of death. (b) In dealing with joint enterprise the learned judge failed to direct the jury that as a secondary party to the killing, they had to be sure that the appellant foresaw the use of a knife as a possibility if he was to be found guilty of murder. Reg. v Powell; Reg. v English [1997] 3 WLR 959 . It will be appreciated that the decision of the House of Lords in that case was given more than twelve months after the judge summed-up this case to the jury. As the law then stood Mr Justice Dyson’s directions to the jury could not be faulted. He had prepared for the jury a synopsis of his directions on murder, manslaughter and common enterprise so that the jury could follow them as they were given. Before we come to his directions, we should state shortly the evidence of the three accused found guilty of manslaughter. Abdul Shahid said that Sharp was shouting racial and other abuse towards the Asians. He saw no-one with weapons, though he said that Uddin and Abbadin had arrived on the scene. He saw Abbadin strike a blow with a bar once or twice and saw Sharp fall down but he saw no-one with a knife, nor did he hear anyone say: “Stab him”. Forid Miah also said Sharp shouted racial and other abuse. He himself had no weapon but he saw one of Abbadin’s friends hit Sharp on the head with a wooden object and Sharp fell down hitting his car. He, Forid Miah, had not taken part in the assault on Sharp at all. Jomir Miah also said that Sharp had made racial comments but they had not upset him. He saw no weapons but he saw Abbadin and Uddin arrive and one of them hit Sharp over the head. He did not recognise the person who struck the first blow but he said: “They then hit him with wooden bars two of them dark in colour”. He did not see where the wooden bars had come from but they had not been used by any of the occupants of the Nova car. It was the new arrivals who attacked Sharp. He did not see any knife, nor did he hear anyone say, “Stab him”. All the accused, including the appellant, had told lies when they were first interviewed. The appellant admitted this in his second interview and after describing how he had arrived on the scene he said that in the fight fists were used and someone “had a bar or something”. He had tried to pull them away but he saw two pieces of wood. He said that there was punching and kicking in the fighting but he did not touch or see any other weapons or a knife. In a third interview he said: “Suddenly there was fight. Everyone was on top of everyone. Everyone was kicking and punching everywhere and all the punches and kicks were directed at the white man.” He said that when the white man fell, everyone started running away and he ran off after the others. The Judge’s Directions. After dealing with the essential elements of the crime of murder, including the necessary intent to kill or do really serious harm, the judge directed the jury that if they were sure that there had been a deliberate non-accidental killing that was unlawful but not sure that it was done with the intent to kill or do really serious harm but they did think that there may have been an intent merely to cause minor harm, for instance, then manslaughter was proved and it was not necessary to consider manslaughter any further. He explained to the jury how provocation could be considered by them as reducing murder to manslaughter if they were satisfied of the necessary ingredients of murder but considered that any of the accused had been caused to lose their self-control by things said or done by Sharp which would have been enough to make a reasonable young Asian male act: “... as the defendant whose case you are considering acted, or may it have done? If the answer is yes then he is guilty of manslaughter by reason of provocation.” The judge emphasised that it was for the prosecution to prove that the accused were not provoked. He explained how an individual defendant could be guilty of murder on his own and said: “For example, in the case of Abdul Tahid you will I expect be sure that his individual act of stabbing caused the death of Mark Sharp. If you are sure looking at the case of an individual defendant that he committed the offence of murder or manslaughter on his own then he is guilty of that offence regardless of whether there was a joint enterprise.” The judge then defined joint enterprise saying: “The prosecution case is that the defendants committed this offence together. Where a criminal offence is committed by two or more persons each of them may play a different part, but if they are acting together as part of a joint plan or agreement to commit it they are each guilty ... The essence of joint enterprise or joint responsibility for a criminal offence is that each defendant shared a common intention to commit the offence and played his part in it. If looking at the case of any defendant you are sure that he did an act or acts as part of a joint plan or agreement to commit it then he is guilty. Put simply, the question for you is were they in it together? Where two or more defendants embark on a joint criminal enterprise each is liable for the acts done in pursuance of it and that includes liability for unusual consequences if they arise from the execution of the joint enterprise, but if it goes beyond what has been agreed as part of the joint enterprise then subject to what I say below about common intention the others are not responsible for that unauthorised act and it is for you as the jury to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise or went beyond it and was an act not authorised by the joint enterprise.” The judge went on to define what was meant by common intention. He said: “In relation to murder it means either that the defendants each intended to kill or cause really serious harm or that the defendant whose case you are considering knew that there was a real possibility that one or more of his co-defendants might act with that particular intention whether he agreed to it or not and with that knowledge nevertheless went on to take part in the attack. But if death is caused by defendant (A) which goes beyond the agreed plan and you are not sure that the act is one that another defendant (B) knew was a real possibility the necessary common intention will not have been established as regards (B) and (B) is not guilty of murder. In relation to manslaughter, the common intention means either that the defendants each intended to cause some injury, but not to kill or cause really serious injury or that the defendant whose case you are considering knew that there was a real possibility that one or more of his co-defendants would cause some injury to the victim, but would not kill him or cause really serious injury and nevertheless joined (A) in the fight.” He went on: “That sounds [as if] it may be rather complicated, but stripped down to its bare essentials the key question to ask of the defendant whose case you are considering is first, did he take part in the attack? Second, did he share a common intention with the other attackers to kill or do really serious harm or if not then in taking part did he know that there was a real possibility that one or more of the attackers might attack Mark Sharp with the intention of killing him or doing really serious harm?” After reviewing all the evidence and reminding the jury that the doctors who had given evidence were agreed that the stab wound was the cause of death but that they could not rule out that the other injuries to the head contributed, the judge fairly summarised for the jury the case as put by the prosecution and as by counsel for each of the defendants. After they had deliberated for some time, the jury asked the judge to define what constituted really serious bodily harm adding: “Can we presume that really serious bodily harm is layman’s terms for grievous bodily harm?” They were told that that was so. Later they asked two more questions. The first: “If we agree that there was a joint enterprise are we allowed then to give differentiated verdicts, i.e. some of murder and some of manslaughter?” The second question was: “If we think that a defendant joined in an attack in any way having seen someone else attack initially do we have to find this a joint enterprise or can we judge it on an individual basis knowing that joint enterprise can be formed within the spur of the moment.” After discussing with counsel the questions and the way in which they should be answered, the judge in answer to the first question said “Yes” and to the second question said: “To that the answer is no. You can judge on an individual basis. I would just like to add two things. The first is that in the second question you use the word “If you think”, I am sure that [think] there is no significance in the word “think” rather than “are sure” but you will remember what I said about the standard of proof. The second is that it is clear to me that you have been studying very carefully the written document that I provided you with and simply to remind you that the intent necessary for murder is an intent to kill or to do really serious bodily harm. If you find that you are not sure about those but you decide there was an intent to do some harm less than really serious bodily harm then the joint enterprise cannot be for murder but can be for manslaughter. I hope that sufficiently answers your questions.” The jury then retired and after further deliberation brought in their verdicts. We think it convenient to deal with the second ground of appeal before considering whether the verdicts were inconsistent. As Lord Hutton made clear in his speech in Reg. v English (supra), if one party to a joint enterprise suddenly forms an intention to kill making use of a deadly weapon and acting in a way which no party to the common design could suspect kills using that deadly weapon the others taking part in the common enterprise are to be judged as secondary parties and are not guilty of murder unless the actions of the party causing death are of a type which they foresee but do not necessarily intend. But as he later explains at page 981, if the weapon used by the primary party is different from but as dangerous as the weapon which the secondary party contemplated he might use, the secondary party should not escape liability for murder because of the difference in the weapon. For example if he foresaw that the primary party might use a gun to kill and the latter used a knife to kill or vice versa. On the question of the degree of foresight required to impose liability, he agreed with the judgment of the Privy Council in Chan Wing-Sui [1985] AC 168 that if a secondary party contemplated the act causing death as a possible incident of the joint venture, he is liable unless the risk was so remote that the jury take the view that the secondary party genuinely dismissed it as altogether negligible. Such an analysis of the assessment of risk, whilst appropriate in the case of criminals who agree together in advance to commit an offence such as armed robbery, does not readily fit the spontaneous behaviour of a group of irrational individuals who jointly attack a common victim , each intending severally to inflict serious harm by any means at their disposal and giving no thought to the means by which the others will individually commit similar offences on the same person. In truth each in committing his individual offence assists and encourages the others in committing their individual offences. They are at the same time principals and secondary parties. Because it is often a matter of chance whether one or other of them inflicts a fatal injury, the law attributes responsibility for the acts done by one to all of them, unless one of the attackers completely departs from the concerted actions of the others and in so doing causes the victim’s death. An example found in the observations of Lord Parker C.J. in Reg. v Anderson: Reg. v Morris [1966] 2 QB 110 at page 120 is when one of the participants suddenly forms an intent to kill using a weapon in a way in which no other party could suspect. In this example the party departing from the common enterprise has not only formed a different intent but has acted in a way which no other party could suspect. In short he has not merely brought about the death of the victim with a different intent but has used a weapon which the others did not know or suspect he had with him. The essential ingredients of his offence are different and the actions of the others coincided with, but did not contribute to or assist, the commission of his offence. The difficulty in applying these principles to a case such as the present led to the expression in the speeches of Lord Mustill and Lord Steyn in Reg. v Powell; Reg. v English (supra) of the difficulties in the concepts of joint enterprise and accessory liability and their calls for urgent review of the law of homicide. Notwithstanding these difficulties, we think that the principles applicable to a case such as the present are: (i) Where several persons join to attack a victim in circumstances which show that they intend to inflict serious harm and as a result of the attack the victim sustains fatal injury, they are jointly liable for murder; but if such injury inflicted with that intent is shown to have been caused solely by the actions of one participant of a type entirely different from actions which the others foresaw as part of the attack, only that participant is guilty of murder. (ii) In deciding whether the actions are of such a different type the use by that party of a weapon is a significant factor. If the character of the weapon, e.g. its propensity to cause death is different from any weapon used or contemplated by the others and if it is used with a specific intent to kill, the others are not responsible for the death unless it is proved that they knew or foresaw the likelihood of the use of such a weapon. (iii) If some or all of the others are using weapons which could be regarded as equally likely to inflict fatal injury, the mere fact that a different weapon was used is immaterial. (iv) If the jury conclude that the death of the victim was caused by the actions of one participant which can be said to be of a completely different type to those contemplated by the others, they are not to be regarded as parties to the death whether it amounts to murder or manslaughter. They may nevertheless be guilty of offences of wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent which they individually commit. (v) If in the course of the concerted attack a weapon is produced by one of the participants and the others knowing that he has it in circumstances where he may use it in the course of the attack participate or continue to participate in the attack, they will be guilty of murder if the weapon is used to inflict a fatal wound. (vi) In a case in which after a concerted attack it is proved that the victim died as a result of a wound with a lethal weapon, e.g. a stab wound, but the evidence does not establish which of the participants used the weapon, then if its use was foreseen by the participants in the attack they will all be guilty of murder notwithstanding that the particular participant who administered the fatal blow cannot be identified. See Reg. v Powell (supra). If, however, the circumstances do not show that the participants foresaw the use of a weapon of this type, none of them will be guilty of murder though they may individually have committed offences in the course of the attack. (vii) The mere fact that by attacking the victim together each of them had the intention to inflict serious harm on the victim is insufficient to make them responsible for the death of the victim caused by the use of a lethal weapon used by one of the participants with the same or shared intention. As we have said, in the present case there was no evidence upon which the jury could find that before the attack began the others involved knew that Abdul Tahid was carrying a flick knife. If the jury accepted the evidence of Mr Tatham who said that whilst in his laundrette on the opposite side of the road from the attack he heard the shout “Stab him” as the attack began, they could as we have said have concluded that those of the defendants who then took part in the attack did so being aware, or at least foreseeing, that a knife might be used with intent to cause really serious harm. Whether those who having heard the shout attacked the deceased with shortened billiard cues as clubs themselves committed the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent or not, they would be guilty of murder as secondary parties. The judge’s direction clearly left it to the jury to say whether one of the accused had gone beyond the common purpose of the concerted attack and he told them that if one of the defendants had done an act which went beyond the agreed plan and they were not sure that the act was one which another defendant knew was a real possibility, the necessary common intention would not have been established. It was suggested that the jury may from this direction have concluded that if a particular defendant had an intention to do really serious harm the existence of that intention was sufficient to make that defendant guilty of murder even though the action of the party who had caused the death went outside the common purpose of the attack. We do not think that the judge’s direction was susceptible of this interpretation but we do think that since the case of Reg. v English (supra) it is necessary for the jury to have their attention directed particularly to the nature of a weapon used in a concerted or combined attack and to knowledge or foresight of the use of such a weapon. In the course of his speech in English Lord Hutton at page 978E said: “In Reg. v Hyde [1991] 1 QB 134, as already set out, Lord Lane CJ stated, at page 139: “If B realises (without agreeing to such conduct being used) that A may kill or intentionally inflict serious injury, but nevertheless continues to participate with A in the venture, that will amount to a sufficient mental element for B to be guilty of murder if A, with the requisite intent, kills in the course of the venture.” However in Hyde the attack on the victim took place without weapons and the Crown case was that the fatal blow to the victim’s head was a heavy kick. The problem raised by the second certified question is that ,if a jury is directed in the terms stated in Hyde, without any qualification (as was the jury in English ), there will be liability for murder on the part of the secondary party if he foresees the possibility that the other party in the criminal venture will cause really serious harm by kicking or striking a blow with a wooden post, but the other party suddenly produces a knife or a gun, which the secondary party did not know he was carrying, and kills the victim with it.” At page 980F he said: “Accordingly, in the appeal of English, I consider that the direction of the trial judge was defective (although this does not constitute a criticism of the judge, who charged the jury in conformity with the principle stated with Hyde ) because in accordance with the principle stated by Lord Parker CJ in Reg. v Anderson at page 120B, he did not qualify his direction on foresight of really serious injury by stating that if the jury considered that the use of the knife by Weddle was the use of a weapon and an action on Weddle’s part which English did not foresee as a possibility, then English should not be convicted of murder. As the unforeseen use of the knife would take the killing outside the scope of the joint venture the jury should also have been directed, as the Court of Criminal Appeal held in Reg. v Anderson, that English should not be found guilty of manslaughter. On the evidence the jury could have found that English did not know that Weddle had a knife. Therefore the judge’s direction made the conviction of English unsafe and in my opinion his appeal should be allowed and the conviction for murder quashed.” [Emphasis added]. Whilst the jury were, as we have said, carefully directed to consider whether the actions of any of the accused went so outside the common purpose that they were not foreseen by the others, the jury’s attention was not specifically focused on the use of the knife by Abdul Tahid and whether on the evidence they were sure that the others were aware that he might use it. As we have said, there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that those of the accused who took part after the shout of “Stab him” must have been aware that one of them had a knife and might use it with intent to do serious harm. Lord Hutton stressed the lethal nature of a knife as a weapon; it was for the jury to say whether its use in this attack was so different from the concerted actions of hitting the deceased with clubs and kicking him with the shod foot that Tahid’s actions went beyond the common purpose. It was also for the jury to say in each case whether those taking part were aware, whether from the shout or otherwise, that one of their number might use a knife. We are further troubled by the distinction apparently drawn by the jury between the parts played by the three accused convicted of manslaughter and the part played by the appellant. If the actions of Tahid did in fact go outside the common purpose of the attack then those who took part aware that a knife might be used were guilty of murder as secondary parties; if they were not aware that a knife might be used they were entitled to be acquitted. (See the observations of Lord Hutton in English ). If, however, the use of the knife did not go outside the common purpose of the attack which from the actions of those taking part was plainly to cause Sharp really serious harm, it is difficult to discern the basis for the verdict of manslaughter or the basis on which the participation of those accused was found by the jury to be different from the participation of the appellant. It is true that each of those accused convicted of manslaughter gave evidence that they did not know that any of their number had a knife and therefore that it might be used with intent to do serious harm but equally there was no evidence that before the attack began and the shout of “Stab him”, the appellant knew that Tahid had a knife. In the circumstances of this case we think that it would be unsafe to allow the conviction of the appellant for murder to stand. We think, however, that as there was evidence from which the jury directed in accordance with Reg. v English could have concluded that the appellant was guilty of murder that there should be a retrial. Equally however, as Tahid had used a lethal weapon, the jury could have concluded that his actions were so outside the common purpose of the attack in which the others joined that they could only be liable for murder if they were aware that Tahid was carrying a knife or could foresee his actions in using a knife in the course of the concerted attack. Accordingly it could be argued that the defendants Abdul Shahid, Jomir Miah and Forid Miah may have been deprived of the chance of acquittal and we direct that this judgment should be drawn to the attention of Abdul Shahid and Jomir Miah and their solicitors for them to consider whether they wish to make a renewed application to the Court for leave to appeal. We direct that any such renewed application should be made within twenty-eight days of their receipt of the judgment. On 3rd October 1997 the Full Court over which I presided dismissed a renewed application for leave to appeal by Forid Miah. The point we have now identified as a possible ground of appeal was not argued on that application and the only way in which we could now consider it in his case is if his conviction were to be referred back to the Court. This judgment should be drawn to his attention and the attention of his solicitors for him to consider whether he wishes to take steps for that to be done. In these circumstances we will consider any application which the Crown may make for an extension of time within which to prefer a fresh indictment. To Counsel: In the case of Forid Miah, his renewed application for leave was before the Court on 3rd October 1997 and was dismissed. The point which we have now identified as a possible ground of appeal in his case was not put forward and, therefore, the Court did not consider it, but it seems to the Court, subject to anything which may be said from the Bar, that the only way in which that matter could be referred back to the Court is through the avenue of the Secretary of State. We therefore have directed that this judgment should be drawn to the attention of Forid Miah and his solicitors for them to consider whether they wish to take that course. Obviously that means that if there is to be a retrial (subject to the decision of the Court in the case of the others, should they renew their applications or should the case of Forid Miah be referred back,) it will mean that the normal period of 28 days within which the Court directs a fresh indictment to be preferred would not be met, but there is power in the Court to extend that time. As we have stated in the judgment, we would like to hear submissions on that point. MR BOTARSKI: I represent the Crown today. Mr Pert was unable to attend the hearing before your Lordships today, but I did manage to speak to him yesterday. What he asked me to ask for from the Court today is an extra period of 14 days after the expiry of the 28 days so that the Crown can consider what the other potential appellants wish to do and prefer an indictment within that period of time. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: I wonder if it would be more sensible not to make a fixed period at this stage. We have given 28 days for the renewal of application for leave. It does not follow that their renewed applications will come before the Court within 28 days or indeed within 14 days thereafter. One would hope that it will, but it seems to me that perhaps the Court might, in the circumstances of this case - because we were told that the Crown would wish to prefer a fresh indictment - subject to anything which we may hear from the appellant, make an order for the fresh indictment, but give leave to the Crown to apply for an extension of time. We could put a period of, say, 56 days with leave to the Crown to apply for an extension if necessary. MR BOTARSKI: Subject to anything that is said, that would be satisfactory to the Crown. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Yes, Mr Amlot. MR AMLOT: My Lords, I have no observations, thank you, to make upon what your Lordship is suggesting. My only concern is, as I read the judgment, your Lordships have ordered that there should be a retrial. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Yes, we did hear submissions on that point, and we concluded that there ought to be a retrial but, for reasons which we have identified, the period during which that retrial would normally take place looks to me to be likely to be extended. MR AMLOT: That leads to my real concern, which is the length of time which might elapse before the retrial takes place. In the circumstances I would want to make an application for bail on the appellant's behalf. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Of course, I understand that. Was he on bail pending the trial? MR AMLOT: He was not, no. He was in custody. He has now been in custody for a long time. The position is he is a young man, of course, and he would be able to go and stay with his parents. No parents are in Court today, but arrangements can be made through my instructing solicitor. He tells me today that he would be in a position to go and stay with them if he were granted bail. I do not know whether your Lordship would like to deal with the question of bail at this stage or wait to see what happens with the other appellants or not. I am in your Lordship's hands. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Is there any objection to bail? MR BOTARSKI: My Lord, there is, given the nature of the offence and your Lordship's decision in relation to a retrial. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: On the face of it, the fact that the offence is serious is not of itself a ground for refusing bail, is it? MR BOTARSKI: My Lord, it is not, but it leads to the risks of failure to attend or intimidation of witnesses or the other matters which the Court does have regard to in relation to this bail order. I understand, though I was not involved in the trial, there were considerable frictions between the families and relatives of the victim. In those circumstances the Crown would be concerned if bail were to be granted. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Yes, thank you. Did you wish to add anything to that? Mr Amlot, you did say, in effect, that the Court might deal with this on the occasion when, if there are any renewed applications, the matter comes back to the Court. MR AMLOT: I would prefer that because one could then assemble arguments more carefully and, if I may say so, that would give the Crown the same opportunity to be fully represented. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: I thought that is what you were submitting, but, of course, it is possible that the other four may not either renew or seek to have it referred, bearing in mind the risks involved, so that it may be that within 28 days the Court will be in a position to know whether he will stand his retrial alone or with others. MR AMLOT: Yes. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: We shall stand over the question of bail until this matter returns to the Court within the 28 day period and we know whether, hopefully within that period, the applications will be renewed. Thank you both very much. ( To the appellant ) Mr Uddin, the Court has allowed your appeal, but it has ordered that you should be retried on this charge. There has been an application made that you should be admitted to bail, but there is an objection to bail on behalf of the Crown and, within 28 days, we have directed that this matter should, if possible, come back to the Court. It may not come back to the same Court, but this Court, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, will consider an application for bail made on your behalf if it is made. Do you understand that? THE APPELLANT: Yes. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Thank you very much, Mr Amlot. © 1998 Crown Copyright BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1998/999.html","Uddin, R v [1998] EWCA Crim 999 (19 March 1998) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] QB 431 ] [Buy ICLR report: [1998] 3 WLR 1000 ] REJAN UDDIN, R v.

At about 5.50 p.m. on the afternoon of Sunday, 27th August 1995, as Mr Mark Sharp was driving his motor car in Haverlock Road, Luton, he was forced to brake sharply when a black Nova motor car driven by Mr Abdul Shahid stopped suddenly in front of him. Displeased by the actions of the driver of the Nova car, Mark Sharp overtook, making a rude gesture as he did so. Shortly afterwards he parked his car in High Town Road near a laundrette. The Nova car pulled up beside him and the four Asian occupants, Shahid the driver, Mr Jomir Miah, Mr Forid Miah and Mr Abdul Tahid, got out and confronted Sharp. An argument ensued and one of the four who had been travelling in the Nova car returned to the car to make a call on a mobile telephone. Shortly afterwards, two other Asians, Mr Rejan Uddin and Mr Abdul Abbadin, and possibly two others, joined the four occupants of the Nova car. They were obviously friends. The two new arrivals appeared to Mr Hughes, a witness, to be older and bigger than the original four. Sharp and the six Asians were all on the pavement and close to a wall. Mr Hughes turned to go back to his car and had hardly taken a step or two when hearing a noise he turned and saw that the six Asians were attacking Sharp. Three of them appeared to be using weapons made out of the bottom half of a snooker cue. He saw Sharp being hit around the head and generally all over the body. The three who did not have weapons were punching and kicking Sharp. As he was being hit around the head, Sharp fell to his knees but the attackers carried on until he fell down completely and was lying still. The six attackers then ran off to their car. The attack had lasted, he thought, 30 seconds. He saw no attempt by Sharp to strike at the attackers or deliver any blows. His impression was that all six attackers were taking part in the violence but he could not say which of them used weapons or which of them kicked or punched. Mr Tatham who owned the laundrette also witnessed the attack. He had come from a shop about two doors away and noticed an argument with five or six young Asian males standing around a white man who was swearing. The Asians then seemed calm and standing around. From just inside the laundrette he saw them on the opposite side of the road and, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a man to his left strike a blow at Sharp who went down. As he went down all the others converged on him and as they did so he heard someone shout: “Stab him!” He added: “When Mr Sharp was in a crouching position they all converged. They were fighting to get one in. There was kicking and everything, hitting and kicking. When Sharp was lying down the group was hitting and kicking.” He heard the words “Stab him” as Sharp went down after the first hit had reduced him to a crouching position and before he was on the ground. All the young Asians were involved together but when they ran off some ran to the right and some to the left. He made a 999 call at 17.52 hrs. in which he said that a man had been stabbed. Another witness, Mr Harper, described how four or five Asians were arguing with Sharp: “They were pulling things out of their sleeves and started to hit him. They looked like poles and bars. I think they all had a weapon like a crome bar, looked like, and one looked like a wooden bar about two feet long. ... They started hitting the man, pushing him to the floor and beating him. I could see all the blood. I thought about five were involved in the attack.” He also said: “All of them started pushing him about, knocked him to the floor and kicked and beat him”. He added that he did not see Sharp use any violence: “He had no chance really. He tried to defend himself, but did not get much chance.” There were several other witnesses to the attack, including a ten year old boy, Ian Smith, watching from the window of a flat overlooking the scene. One of the newcomers, he thought, took a big stick from his sleeve which looked like part of a snooker cue and he started hitting the white man (who was Sharp): “He didn’t make him go down and the white man turned and looked around. Then another Asian kicked him. He banged off the railings of the church and fell down. Then all of them just started hitting him, stamping on him and kicking him. All the men who came down the road had sticks as well. These sticks were all the same as the first stick that I just described. When the white man fell to the ground, the Asians with sticks hit him with their sticks. Others were stamping on him and kicking him. All of them were attacking him. No-one was trying to stop what was happening.” He thought he saw about five sticks. After the attackers had departed, Mark Sharp was found to be seriously injured. He died three days later. Five of those who were said to have taken part in the attack were arrested and charged with the murder of Mark Sharp. They were: the appellant Rejan Uddin, Abdul Shahid, Forid Miah, Jomir Miah and Abdul Tahid. Abdul Abbadin could not be found. The five who were charged were tried in the Crown Court at Luton before Mr Justice Dyson and a jury. On 11th July 1996 the appellant Rejan Uddin and Abdul Tahid were convicted of murder and sentenced to custody for life. Jomir Miah, Abdul Shahid and Forid Miah were acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. Forid Miah and Abdul Shahid were sentenced to four years imprisonment. Jomir Miah to four years detention in a Young Offenders Institution. Mark Sharp died from injuries to his head. The most serious, and the cause of his death, was a stab wound delivered with moderate force near the base of the skull and which penetrated the brain but there were two other injuries to the head caused by a blow with a blunt instrument struck with mild to moderate force which might have been sufficient to cause unconsciousness and could not be ruled out as contributory causes of death but neither of the two doctors who gave evidence could state that they had actually done so. The blow with the knife was delivered by Abdul Tahid who apparently produced a flick knife from his pocket as he joined in the attack. Apart from the shout of “Stab him” heard by the witness Mr Tatham, there was no evidence that the other defendants knew that Abdul Tahid had a knife and all denied doing so. The three defendants convicted of manslaughter all gave evidence; the appellant did not. The defendants convicted of manslaughter were of good character and apparently the appellant was not. One of the grounds of appeal advanced by Mr Amlot Q.C. for Uddin was that the judge in giving the jury the appropriate direction on the significance of the evidence of the good character of the defendants who testified, did so in a manner which unnecessarily drew attention to the fact that he gave no such direction in the case of the appellant. It was said that the manner of his direction would have been likely to signal to the jury that the appellant was not of good character. In our view the criticism of the learned judge’s summing-up in this respect is unjustified and we find it unnecessary to say more of this ground of appeal. Whilst the jury were deliberating on their verdicts, they reported to the judge that four of them had received telephone calls from a caller or callers who, when the telephone was answered, said nothing. It was submitted to the judge that he should discharge the jury. The judge’s handling of the situation was faultless and he declined to do so. Again we find it unnecessary to deal in detail with the submission to us that the appellant’s conviction was unsafe because the judge ought to have discharged the jury. It is sufficient to say that he gave the jury appropriate warnings and guidance and that no basis was shown on which we could review the exercise of his discretion. Accordingly we reject this ground of appeal. We now come to the main grounds of appeal which were: (a) That the verdict in the appellant’s case was inconsistent with the verdicts of manslaughter in the cases of the three co-defendants (Abdul Shahid, Jomir Miah, Forid Miah) who were acquitted of murder. The appellant was in no different position from those co-defendants. In each case there was no evidence that the defendant knew that a fourth defendant (Abdul Tahid) had a knife or would use it. A single stab wound to the head was the cause of death. (b) In dealing with joint enterprise the learned judge failed to direct the jury that as a secondary party to the killing, they had to be sure that the appellant foresaw the use of a knife as a possibility if he was to be found guilty of murder. Reg. v Powell; Reg. v English [1997] 3 WLR 959 . It will be appreciated that the decision of the House of Lords in that case was given more than twelve months after the judge summed-up this case to the jury. As the law then stood Mr Justice Dyson’s directions to the jury could not be faulted. He had prepared for the jury a synopsis of his directions on murder, manslaughter and common enterprise so that the jury could follow them as they were given. Before we come to his directions, we should state shortly the evidence of the three accused found guilty of manslaughter. Abdul Shahid said that Sharp was shouting racial and other abuse towards the Asians. He saw no-one with weapons, though he said that Uddin and Abbadin had arrived on the scene. He saw Abbadin strike a blow with a bar once or twice and saw Sharp fall down but he saw no-one with a knife, nor did he hear anyone say: “Stab him”. Forid Miah also said Sharp shouted racial and other abuse. He himself had no weapon but he saw one of Abbadin’s friends hit Sharp on the head with a wooden object and Sharp fell down hitting his car. He, Forid Miah, had not taken part in the assault on Sharp at all. Jomir Miah also said that Sharp had made racial comments but they had not upset him. He saw no weapons but he saw Abbadin and Uddin arrive and one of them hit Sharp over the head. He did not recognise the person who struck the first blow but he said: “They then hit him with wooden bars two of them dark in colour”. He did not see where the wooden bars had come from but they had not been used by any of the occupants of the Nova car. It was the new arrivals who attacked Sharp. He did not see any knife, nor did he hear anyone say, “Stab him”. All the accused, including the appellant, had told lies when they were first interviewed. The appellant admitted this in his second interview and after describing how he had arrived on the scene he said that in the fight fists were used and someone “had a bar or something”. He had tried to pull them away but he saw two pieces of wood. He said that there was punching and kicking in the fighting but he did not touch or see any other weapons or a knife. In a third interview he said: “Suddenly there was fight. Everyone was on top of everyone. Everyone was kicking and punching everywhere and all the punches and kicks were directed at the white man.” He said that when the white man fell, everyone started running away and he ran off after the others. The Judge’s Directions. After dealing with the essential elements of the crime of murder, including the necessary intent to kill or do really serious harm, the judge directed the jury that if they were sure that there had been a deliberate non-accidental killing that was unlawful but not sure that it was done with the intent to kill or do really serious harm but they did think that there may have been an intent merely to cause minor harm, for instance, then manslaughter was proved and it was not necessary to consider manslaughter any further. He explained to the jury how provocation could be considered by them as reducing murder to manslaughter if they were satisfied of the necessary ingredients of murder but considered that any of the accused had been caused to lose their self-control by things said or done by Sharp which would have been enough to make a reasonable young Asian male act: “... as the defendant whose case you are considering acted, or may it have done? If the answer is yes then he is guilty of manslaughter by reason of provocation.” The judge emphasised that it was for the prosecution to prove that the accused were not provoked. He explained how an individual defendant could be guilty of murder on his own and said: “For example, in the case of Abdul Tahid you will I expect be sure that his individual act of stabbing caused the death of Mark Sharp. If you are sure looking at the case of an individual defendant that he committed the offence of murder or manslaughter on his own then he is guilty of that offence regardless of whether there was a joint enterprise.” The judge then defined joint enterprise saying: “The prosecution case is that the defendants committed this offence together. Where a criminal offence is committed by two or more persons each of them may play a different part, but if they are acting together as part of a joint plan or agreement to commit it they are each guilty ... The essence of joint enterprise or joint responsibility for a criminal offence is that each defendant shared a common intention to commit the offence and played his part in it. If looking at the case of any defendant you are sure that he did an act or acts as part of a joint plan or agreement to commit it then he is guilty. Put simply, the question for you is were they in it together? Where two or more defendants embark on a joint criminal enterprise each is liable for the acts done in pursuance of it and that includes liability for unusual consequences if they arise from the execution of the joint enterprise, but if it goes beyond what has been agreed as part of the joint enterprise then subject to what I say below about common intention the others are not responsible for that unauthorised act and it is for you as the jury to decide whether what was done was part of the joint enterprise or went beyond it and was an act not authorised by the joint enterprise.” The judge went on to define what was meant by common intention. He said: “In relation to murder it means either that the defendants each intended to kill or cause really serious harm or that the defendant whose case you are considering knew that there was a real possibility that one or more of his co-defendants might act with that particular intention whether he agreed to it or not and with that knowledge nevertheless went on to take part in the attack. But if death is caused by defendant (A) which goes beyond the agreed plan and you are not sure that the act is one that another defendant (B) knew was a real possibility the necessary common intention will not have been established as regards (B) and (B) is not guilty of murder. In relation to manslaughter, the common intention means either that the defendants each intended to cause some injury, but not to kill or cause really serious injury or that the defendant whose case you are considering knew that there was a real possibility that one or more of his co-defendants would cause some injury to the victim, but would not kill him or cause really serious injury and nevertheless joined (A) in the fight.” He went on: “That sounds it may be rather complicated, but stripped down to its bare essentials the key question to ask of the defendant whose case you are considering is first, did he take part in the attack? Second, did he share a common intention with the other attackers to kill or do really serious harm or if not then in taking part did he know that there was a real possibility that one or more of the attackers might attack Mark Sharp with the intention of killing him or doing really serious harm?” After reviewing all the evidence and reminding the jury that the doctors who had given evidence were agreed that the stab wound was the cause of death but that they could not rule out that the other injuries to the head contributed, the judge fairly summarised for the jury the case as put by the prosecution and as by counsel for each of the defendants. After they had deliberated for some time, the jury asked the judge to define what constituted really serious bodily harm adding: “Can we presume that really serious bodily harm is layman’s terms for grievous bodily harm?” They were told that that was so. Later they asked two more questions. The first: “If we agree that there was a joint enterprise are we allowed then to give differentiated verdicts, i.e. some of murder and some of manslaughter?” The second question was: “If we think that a defendant joined in an attack in any way having seen someone else attack initially do we have to find this a joint enterprise or can we judge it on an individual basis knowing that joint enterprise can be formed within the spur of the moment.” After discussing with counsel the questions and the way in which they should be answered, the judge in answer to the first question said “Yes” and to the second question said: “To that the answer is no. You can judge on an individual basis. I would just like to add two things. The first is that in the second question you use the word “If you think”, I am sure that there is no significance in the word “think” rather than “are sure” but you will remember what I said about the standard of proof. The second is that it is clear to me that you have been studying very carefully the written document that I provided you with and simply to remind you that the intent necessary for murder is an intent to kill or to do really serious bodily harm. If you find that you are not sure about those but you decide there was an intent to do some harm less than really serious bodily harm then the joint enterprise cannot be for murder but can be for manslaughter. I hope that sufficiently answers your questions.” The jury then retired and after further deliberation brought in their verdicts. We think it convenient to deal with the second ground of appeal before considering whether the verdicts were inconsistent. As Lord Hutton made clear in his speech in Reg. v English (supra), if one party to a joint enterprise suddenly forms an intention to kill making use of a deadly weapon and acting in a way which no party to the common design could suspect kills using that deadly weapon the others taking part in the common enterprise are to be judged as secondary parties and are not guilty of murder unless the actions of the party causing death are of a type which they foresee but do not necessarily intend. But as he later explains at page 981, if the weapon used by the primary party is different from but as dangerous as the weapon which the secondary party contemplated he might use, the secondary party should not escape liability for murder because of the difference in the weapon. For example if he foresaw that the primary party might use a gun to kill and the latter used a knife to kill or vice versa. On the question of the degree of foresight required to impose liability, he agreed with the judgment of the Privy Council in Chan Wing-Sui [1985] AC 168 that if a secondary party contemplated the act causing death as a possible incident of the joint venture, he is liable unless the risk was so remote that the jury take the view that the secondary party genuinely dismissed it as altogether negligible. Such an analysis of the assessment of risk, whilst appropriate in the case of criminals who agree together in advance to commit an offence such as armed robbery, does not readily fit the spontaneous behaviour of a group of irrational individuals who jointly attack a common victim , each intending severally to inflict serious harm by any means at their disposal and giving no thought to the means by which the others will individually commit similar offences on the same person. In truth each in committing his individual offence assists and encourages the others in committing their individual offences. They are at the same time principals and secondary parties. Because it is often a matter of chance whether one or other of them inflicts a fatal injury, the law attributes responsibility for the acts done by one to all of them, unless one of the attackers completely departs from the concerted actions of the others and in so doing causes the victim’s death. An example found in the observations of Lord Parker C.J. in Reg. v Anderson: Reg. v Morris [1966] 2 QB 110 at page 120 is when one of the participants suddenly forms an intent to kill using a weapon in a way in which no other party could suspect. In this example the party departing from the common enterprise has not only formed a different intent but has acted in a way which no other party could suspect. In short he has not merely brought about the death of the victim with a different intent but has used a weapon which the others did not know or suspect he had with him. The essential ingredients of his offence are different and the actions of the others coincided with, but did not contribute to or assist, the commission of his offence. The difficulty in applying these principles to a case such as the present led to the expression in the speeches of Lord Mustill and Lord Steyn in Reg. v Powell; Reg. v English (supra) of the difficulties in the concepts of joint enterprise and accessory liability and their calls for urgent review of the law of homicide. Notwithstanding these difficulties, we think that the principles applicable to a case such as the present are: (i) Where several persons join to attack a victim in circumstances which show that they intend to inflict serious harm and as a result of the attack the victim sustains fatal injury, they are jointly liable for murder; but if such injury inflicted with that intent is shown to have been caused solely by the actions of one participant of a type entirely different from actions which the others foresaw as part of the attack, only that participant is guilty of murder. (ii) In deciding whether the actions are of such a different type the use by that party of a weapon is a significant factor. If the character of the weapon, e.g. its propensity to cause death is different from any weapon used or contemplated by the others and if it is used with a specific intent to kill, the others are not responsible for the death unless it is proved that they knew or foresaw the likelihood of the use of such a weapon. (iii) If some or all of the others are using weapons which could be regarded as equally likely to inflict fatal injury, the mere fact that a different weapon was used is immaterial. (iv) If the jury conclude that the death of the victim was caused by the actions of one participant which can be said to be of a completely different type to those contemplated by the others, they are not to be regarded as parties to the death whether it amounts to murder or manslaughter. They may nevertheless be guilty of offences of wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent which they individually commit. (v) If in the course of the concerted attack a weapon is produced by one of the participants and the others knowing that he has it in circumstances where he may use it in the course of the attack participate or continue to participate in the attack, they will be guilty of murder if the weapon is used to inflict a fatal wound. (vi) In a case in which after a concerted attack it is proved that the victim died as a result of a wound with a lethal weapon, e.g. a stab wound, but the evidence does not establish which of the participants used the weapon, then if its use was foreseen by the participants in the attack they will all be guilty of murder notwithstanding that the particular participant who administered the fatal blow cannot be identified. See Reg. v Powell (supra). If, however, the circumstances do not show that the participants foresaw the use of a weapon of this type, none of them will be guilty of murder though they may individually have committed offences in the course of the attack. (vii) The mere fact that by attacking the victim together each of them had the intention to inflict serious harm on the victim is insufficient to make them responsible for the death of the victim caused by the use of a lethal weapon used by one of the participants with the same or shared intention. As we have said, in the present case there was no evidence upon which the jury could find that before the attack began the others involved knew that Abdul Tahid was carrying a flick knife. If the jury accepted the evidence of Mr Tatham who said that whilst in his laundrette on the opposite side of the road from the attack he heard the shout “Stab him” as the attack began, they could as we have said have concluded that those of the defendants who then took part in the attack did so being aware, or at least foreseeing, that a knife might be used with intent to cause really serious harm. Whether those who having heard the shout attacked the deceased with shortened billiard cues as clubs themselves committed the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent or not, they would be guilty of murder as secondary parties. The judge’s direction clearly left it to the jury to say whether one of the accused had gone beyond the common purpose of the concerted attack and he told them that if one of the defendants had done an act which went beyond the agreed plan and they were not sure that the act was one which another defendant knew was a real possibility, the necessary common intention would not have been established. It was suggested that the jury may from this direction have concluded that if a particular defendant had an intention to do really serious harm the existence of that intention was sufficient to make that defendant guilty of murder even though the action of the party who had caused the death went outside the common purpose of the attack. We do not think that the judge’s direction was susceptible of this interpretation but we do think that since the case of Reg. v English (supra) it is necessary for the jury to have their attention directed particularly to the nature of a weapon used in a concerted or combined attack and to knowledge or foresight of the use of such a weapon. In the course of his speech in English Lord Hutton at page 978E said: “In Reg. v Hyde [1991] 1 QB 134, as already set out, Lord Lane CJ stated, at page 139: “If B realises (without agreeing to such conduct being used) that A may kill or intentionally inflict serious injury, but nevertheless continues to participate with A in the venture, that will amount to a sufficient mental element for B to be guilty of murder if A, with the requisite intent, kills in the course of the venture.” However in Hyde the attack on the victim took place without weapons and the Crown case was that the fatal blow to the victim’s head was a heavy kick. The problem raised by the second certified question is that ,if a jury is directed in the terms stated in Hyde, without any qualification (as was the jury in English ), there will be liability for murder on the part of the secondary party if he foresees the possibility that the other party in the criminal venture will cause really serious harm by kicking or striking a blow with a wooden post, but the other party suddenly produces a knife or a gun, which the secondary party did not know he was carrying, and kills the victim with it.” At page 980F he said: “Accordingly, in the appeal of English, I consider that the direction of the trial judge was defective (although this does not constitute a criticism of the judge, who charged the jury in conformity with the principle stated with Hyde ) because in accordance with the principle stated by Lord Parker CJ in Reg. v Anderson at page 120B, he did not qualify his direction on foresight of really serious injury by stating that if the jury considered that the use of the knife by Weddle was the use of a weapon and an action on Weddle’s part which English did not foresee as a possibility, then English should not be convicted of murder. As the unforeseen use of the knife would take the killing outside the scope of the joint venture the jury should also have been directed, as the Court of Criminal Appeal held in Reg. v Anderson, that English should not be found guilty of manslaughter. On the evidence the jury could have found that English did not know that Weddle had a knife. Therefore the judge’s direction made the conviction of English unsafe and in my opinion his appeal should be allowed and the conviction for murder quashed.” . Whilst the jury were, as we have said, carefully directed to consider whether the actions of any of the accused went so outside the common purpose that they were not foreseen by the others, the jury’s attention was not specifically focused on the use of the knife by Abdul Tahid and whether on the evidence they were sure that the others were aware that he might use it. As we have said, there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that those of the accused who took part after the shout of “Stab him” must have been aware that one of them had a knife and might use it with intent to do serious harm. Lord Hutton stressed the lethal nature of a knife as a weapon; it was for the jury to say whether its use in this attack was so different from the concerted actions of hitting the deceased with clubs and kicking him with the shod foot that Tahid’s actions went beyond the common purpose. It was also for the jury to say in each case whether those taking part were aware, whether from the shout or otherwise, that one of their number might use a knife. We are further troubled by the distinction apparently drawn by the jury between the parts played by the three accused convicted of manslaughter and the part played by the appellant. If the actions of Tahid did in fact go outside the common purpose of the attack then those who took part aware that a knife might be used were guilty of murder as secondary parties; if they were not aware that a knife might be used they were entitled to be acquitted. (See the observations of Lord Hutton in English ). If, however, the use of the knife did not go outside the common purpose of the attack which from the actions of those taking part was plainly to cause Sharp really serious harm, it is difficult to discern the basis for the verdict of manslaughter or the basis on which the participation of those accused was found by the jury to be different from the participation of the appellant. It is true that each of those accused convicted of manslaughter gave evidence that they did not know that any of their number had a knife and therefore that it might be used with intent to do serious harm but equally there was no evidence that before the attack began and the shout of “Stab him”, the appellant knew that Tahid had a knife. In the circumstances of this case we think that it would be unsafe to allow the conviction of the appellant for murder to stand. We think, however, that as there was evidence from which the jury directed in accordance with Reg. v English could have concluded that the appellant was guilty of murder that there should be a retrial. Equally however, as Tahid had used a lethal weapon, the jury could have concluded that his actions were so outside the common purpose of the attack in which the others joined that they could only be liable for murder if they were aware that Tahid was carrying a knife or could foresee his actions in using a knife in the course of the concerted attack. Accordingly it could be argued that the defendants Abdul Shahid, Jomir Miah and Forid Miah may have been deprived of the chance of acquittal and we direct that this judgment should be drawn to the attention of Abdul Shahid and Jomir Miah and their solicitors for them to consider whether they wish to make a renewed application to the Court for leave to appeal. We direct that any such renewed application should be made within twenty-eight days of their receipt of the judgment. On 3rd October 1997 the Full Court over which I presided dismissed a renewed application for leave to appeal by Forid Miah. The point we have now identified as a possible ground of appeal was not argued on that application and the only way in which we could now consider it in his case is if his conviction were to be referred back to the Court. This judgment should be drawn to his attention and the attention of his solicitors for him to consider whether he wishes to take steps for that to be done. In these circumstances we will consider any application which the Crown may make for an extension of time within which to prefer a fresh indictment. To Counsel: In the case of Forid Miah, his renewed application for leave was before the Court on 3rd October 1997 and was dismissed. The point which we have now identified as a possible ground of appeal in his case was not put forward and, therefore, the Court did not consider it, but it seems to the Court, subject to anything which may be said from the Bar, that the only way in which that matter could be referred back to the Court is through the avenue of the Secretary of State. We therefore have directed that this judgment should be drawn to the attention of Forid Miah and his solicitors for them to consider whether they wish to take that course. Obviously that means that if there is to be a retrial (subject to the decision of the Court in the case of the others, should they renew their applications or should the case of Forid Miah be referred back,) it will mean that the normal period of 28 days within which the Court directs a fresh indictment to be preferred would not be met, but there is power in the Court to extend that time. As we have stated in the judgment, we would like to hear submissions on that point. MR BOTARSKI: I represent the Crown today. Mr Pert was unable to attend the hearing before your Lordships today, but I did manage to speak to him yesterday. What he asked me to ask for from the Court today is an extra period of 14 days after the expiry of the 28 days so that the Crown can consider what the other potential appellants wish to do and prefer an indictment within that period of time. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: I wonder if it would be more sensible not to make a fixed period at this stage. We have given 28 days for the renewal of application for leave. It does not follow that their renewed applications will come before the Court within 28 days or indeed within 14 days thereafter. One would hope that it will, but it seems to me that perhaps the Court might, in the circumstances of this case - because we were told that the Crown would wish to prefer a fresh indictment - subject to anything which we may hear from the appellant, make an order for the fresh indictment, but give leave to the Crown to apply for an extension of time. We could put a period of, say, 56 days with leave to the Crown to apply for an extension if necessary. MR BOTARSKI: Subject to anything that is said, that would be satisfactory to the Crown. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Yes, Mr Amlot. MR AMLOT: My Lords, I have no observations, thank you, to make upon what your Lordship is suggesting. My only concern is, as I read the judgment, your Lordships have ordered that there should be a retrial. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Yes, we did hear submissions on that point, and we concluded that there ought to be a retrial but, for reasons which we have identified, the period during which that retrial would normally take place looks to me to be likely to be extended. MR AMLOT: That leads to my real concern, which is the length of time which might elapse before the retrial takes place. In the circumstances I would want to make an application for bail on the appellant's behalf. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Of course, I understand that. Was he on bail pending the trial? MR AMLOT: He was not, no. He was in custody. He has now been in custody for a long time. The position is he is a young man, of course, and he would be able to go and stay with his parents. No parents are in Court today, but arrangements can be made through my instructing solicitor. He tells me today that he would be in a position to go and stay with them if he were granted bail. I do not know whether your Lordship would like to deal with the question of bail at this stage or wait to see what happens with the other appellants or not. I am in your Lordship's hands. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Is there any objection to bail? MR BOTARSKI: My Lord, there is, given the nature of the offence and your Lordship's decision in relation to a retrial. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: On the face of it, the fact that the offence is serious is not of itself a ground for refusing bail, is it? MR BOTARSKI: My Lord, it is not, but it leads to the risks of failure to attend or intimidation of witnesses or the other matters which the Court does have regard to in relation to this bail order. I understand, though I was not involved in the trial, there were considerable frictions between the families and relatives of the victim. In those circumstances the Crown would be concerned if bail were to be granted. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Yes, thank you. Did you wish to add anything to that? Mr Amlot, you did say, in effect, that the Court might deal with this on the occasion when, if there are any renewed applications, the matter comes back to the Court. MR AMLOT: I would prefer that because one could then assemble arguments more carefully and, if I may say so, that would give the Crown the same opportunity to be fully represented. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: I thought that is what you were submitting, but, of course, it is possible that the other four may not either renew or seek to have it referred, bearing in mind the risks involved, so that it may be that within 28 days the Court will be in a position to know whether he will stand his retrial alone or with others. MR AMLOT: Yes. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: We shall stand over the question of bail until this matter returns to the Court within the 28 day period and we know whether, hopefully within that period, the applications will be renewed. Thank you both very much. ( To the appellant ) Mr Uddin, the Court has allowed your appeal, but it has ordered that you should be retried on this charge. There has been an application made that you should be admitted to bail, but there is an objection to bail on behalf of the Crown and, within 28 days, we have directed that this matter should, if possible, come back to the Court. It may not come back to the same Court, but this Court, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, will consider an application for bail made on your behalf if it is made. Do you understand that? THE APPELLANT: Yes. LORD JUSTICE BELDAM: Thank you very much, Mr Amlot. © 1998 Crown Copyright"

The jury were unable to agree a verdict on a second offence of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. On 26 January 2022 the applicant was sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment. The applicant was refused leave by the single judge to appeal against conviction and sentence. He renews his application for leave to appeal both against conviction and sentence today. He also seeks leave to amend his grounds. He seeks leave in addition to adduce fresh evidence in the form of a number of witness statements. He has been represented today by Dr Gerry KC who has very fully developed the original grounds and the amended grounds by reference to a wide range of materials. The facts can be stated shortly. On the evening of 24 August 2019 (a Saturday) a private event was taking place at a nightclub in Rupert Street, Soho, London. The applicant and another man, Richard Palmer, attended the event. They arrived at 00.30 on the morning of Sunday 25 August 2019. A fight broke out. During the course of that fight an individual was stabbed. The event was closed down and everyone was required to leave the venue. Outside the venue Palmer ran down the street and shot the victim twice in the back. Palmer was charged with attempted murder. The prosecution case was that Palmer did not act alone. It was said that Pommell had assisted and encouraged Palmer. That was count 1 on the indictment. The prosecution also alleged that Pommell had had the gun in his possession at some stage during the night. That formed the subject matter of count 2 on the indictment. There had earlier been a trial in relation to this incident. At that earlier trial three men were accused of various charges. First, Pommell and Palmer were charged with attempted murder. Secondly, Pommell and Palmer were charged with possession of a firearm, a .22 Beretta pistol. Thirdly, Pommell, Palmer and a third man, Roberts, were charged with transfer of a prohibited firearm. Palmer had initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges. On 10 October 2020 Palmer changed his plea and pleaded guilty to attempted murder. On 14 January 2021 he pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. At the earlier trial Pommell pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and possession of a firearm. The jury could not reach a verdict at that earlier trial hence the need for a retrial on those two counts. In relation to the third count, transfer of a prohibited weapon, this was an allegation that in the evening of 24 August 2019 Pommell, Palmer and Roberts had been together at a house in Coleridge Drive and Roberts had handed the Beretta pistol to the others. Roberts had never been at the nightclub so any transfer of the gun from him to the other two must have happened before Palmer and Pommell got to the nightclub. All three defendants were acquitted of the count of transfer of the prohibited weapon. Turning to the retrial, which is the subject matter of this application, Pommell was charged with attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. As indicated, the prosecution case was that Palmer was the shooter, that he did not act alone and Pommell was a secondary party as he encouraged or assisted Palmer in the attempted murder. The prosecution also alleged that Pommell had been in possession of the gun that evening in the nightclub and he (Pommell) had handed it over to Palmer outside the club. The prosecution relied upon a number of strands of evidence. Among them was CCTV footage from inside and outside the nightclub and video footage from dash board cameras from cars in the street. The prosecution said that the footage showed Pommell and Palmer standing by Pommell's car and showed Pommell pointing up the street, Palmer running up the street, stopping, looking back to Pommell, Pommell pointing and then Palmer shooting the victim twice. The prosecution also relied upon Pommell's failure to give evidence at trial as evidence supporting their case. The defence case was that the applicant knew nothing of any planned violence. He did not participate or direct or encourage Palmer to shoot anyone. He was not aware that Palmer had a gun. He relied on a number of witnesses. These included the co-host of the party who was standing by Pommell outside the nightclub later. That person said he did not see the applicant with the gun and that he did not consider the applicant had encouraged Palmer to shoot anyone. Critically, Palmer (the man who admitted shooting the victim) was also called as a witness on Pommell's behalf. He gave evidence that he had shot the victim and that Pommell was not involved. Palmer said that he (Palmer) had bought the gun because he was worried for the safety of his family as he owed money for drugs. He refused to say where or from whom he had obtained the gun. He said the gun was in his bag which was in Pommell's car. He said that he and Pommell had been standing together by the car and they had got into the car at one stage prior to the shooting as he (Palmer) wanted a cannabis grinder. Palmer said that when they were standing by the car subsequently, Pommell was pointing and was saying something like: ""Look, there's something going on."" Palmer said that he then run up the street, saw a friend of his fall to the ground, was told the friend had been stabbed and so he shot the victim thinking that the victim had stabbed his friend. Palmer was cross-examined on a number of matters. These included the fact that he had been talking to Pommell by the car, that Pommell was pointing down the street, that Palmer had run down the street looked back at Pommell and then turned and shot the victim. It was put to Palmer that in his defence statement made prior to his change of plea to guilty to attempted murder, Palmer had said that he had taken drugs and alcohol and was paranoid. He had heard men screaming and shouting and so ran towards the noise and shot one of them. It was put to him that he had never said in his defence statement anything about him having shot the victim because he believed erroneously that the victim had stabbed his friend. He had never said anything about being told that his friend had been stabbed. He was also asked about the shooting itself. Palmer said that he had taken the gun from a bag he was carrying and he had shot the victim. He was asked when he loaded the gun. Palmer said that it had been loaded earlier in that evening before he had left the house and he had carried it loaded throughout the evening even though it did not have a safety catch. It was put to him that he was giving evidence now at Pommell's bidding in effect to exonerate Pommell but he effectively denied that. At one stage the defence applied to admit evidence of the fact that Palmer had been acquitted at the first trial of the offence of transferring the gun. The judge refused leave to adduce the evidence of the acquittal. On the attempted murder charge the issues for the jury were identified by the judge as follows: Were they sure that the applicant Pommell was aware that Palmer had a gun in his possession when he set off up the road? If they were sure that Pommell knew Palmer had the gun, were they sure that he shared the intention with Palmer that the gun should be used to kill? Did the applicant encourage or assist Palmer in the carrying out of the joint venture with the intention of killing the victim? In relation to count 2 and possession of a firearm with intention to endanger life, the judge identified the issues for the jury as follows: Did the applicant possess the Beretta pistol? Did he intend at any stage during the night of 24/25 to endanger life? The jury convicted the applicant on count 1, attempted murder, but were unable to reach a verdict on count 2. The applicant was sentenced on 26 January 2022 to 26 years' imprisonment. It was agreed and the judge accepted that the case fell within Category A2 of the Sentencing Council Guidelines for attempted murder. The judge considered that the applicant was the prime mover and the motivator behind the attack. The judge also considered that there was a degree of planning as the gun was brought to the scene. She considered that the applicant did have a gun in his possession in the nightclub during the course of the night, notwithstanding the fact that the jury had been unable to reach a verdict on that matter. The judge noted that the applicant had no previous convictions for violence. The starting point under the recently issued guidelines was 30 years. The judge took into account that various matters had led to the sentencing of Pommell taking place after the introduction of those guidelines, whereas Palmer had been sentenced under earlier guidelines. She considered the sentence she had imposed in Palmer's case where she had taken a starting point of 24 years and then reduced that to reflect the particular mitigation in Palmer's case. She the imposed a sentence on Pommell of 26 years' imprisonment. We deal first with the application for leave to appeal against conviction. We start with consideration of the question of the safety of the conviction. The applicant originally applied for leave to appeal against conviction on two grounds. Leave to appeal was refused by the single judge. The applicant instructed fresh counsel and made a renewed application with additional grounds. The first ground is that the judge was wrong not to allow the defence to adduce details of Palmer's acquittal at the trial. In the first set of grounds, also adopted by Dr Gerry today, it was put on the basis that whilst it was proper to cross-examine Palmer on matters to do with the contents of the defence statement, it was correct and proper in that context to adduce the details of the first trial and the acquittal. In the revised grounds it is put on the basis that if the acquittal at trial of the applicant had been admitted in evidence it would have demonstrated that Palmer must have been believed by the jury. Dr Gerry expanded on those submissions this morning. Her essential submission was that the prosecution had explored the possibility of the transfer of the gun in a number of ways during the trial and she submitted it was therefore relevant for the jury to hear about the acquittal on the transfer of the gun and secondly that it would have undermined the prosecution case and support Mr Pommell's case. On the second way of putting it, it is submitted that had the jury known of the acquittal of Mr Palmer that would or might have boosted his credibility in the eyes of the jury. We see no basis in this ground of appeal. The first point to note is that the question of the acquittal in relation to the transfer of the gun concerned the question solely of whether the gun had been handed over to Pommell and Palmer by Roberts on the evening of 24 August 2019. Although Dr Gerry refers to parts of the summing-up at the first trial which records Mr Pommell's case that he denied having the gun at any stage in the night, it is clear that the issue at the first trial must have included transfer prior to the nightclub because Mr Roberts never went to the nightclub. The first point to note then is that the acquittal related to the question of transfer from Roberts to Pommell and Palmer which logically is likely to have been at Coleridge Drive and not at a later stage in the evening. Secondly, as a general rule, evidence of an acquittal is not admissible as it is not legally relevant. That is the position here. The fact that the jury in the first trial were not sure that the gun was handed over by Roberts earlier on in the evening of 24 August 2019 is not legally relevant to the events concerning the shooting in the early morning of 25 August 2019. Thirdly, there is no question of the matter going to the credibility of Palmer. He did not give evidence at the first trial and there could have been no possibility of a jury having believed what he said in evidence for the simple reason that he did not give evidence. The second ground of appeal in the original grounds was that the summing-up was unfair. That ground was essentially an assertion that the judge had focused not on what Palmer's evidence was but dealt largely or exclusively with the criticism of it by the prosecution. In the perfected original grounds attention is drawn to three particular comments made by the judge. Dr Gerry in oral submission this morning took us to other passages in which it is submitted that the judge gave an unbalanced and flawed approach which in effect prevented the jury from fairly assessing Palmer's evidence. We have read the entirety of the summing-up. The judge very clearly set out the nature of the applicant's case early on in the summing-up. She said that the applicant through counsel and his witnesses said that he knew nothing of any planned violence. He said he did not participate, far less direct, organise or encourage Palmer or anyone else for that matter to do harm to anyone that night. The judge identified the critical issues in the case. She then summarised the prosecution evidence. In relation to the fact that the applicant was pointing up the street, she reminded the jury of the evidence that others were also pointing. She dealt with the evidence called on behalf of the applicant, starting with Mr Sinclair and then the Entessania sisters. The judge then dealt with the evidence of Palmer. She explained why the jury had heard evidence of Palmer's criminal convictions. She summarised his evidence-in-chief including how he said that he acquired the gun. She reminded the jury that Palmer had said that Pommell had picked him up and Palmer had not told him that he, Palmer, had a gun. Palmer said the gun was in his bag and that was in the car. She reminded the jury that Palmer's evidence was that he saw his friend in a commotion, that the friend stumbled into the road and someone had told him that the friend had been stabbed. She reminded them of Palmer's evidence that at this point all that Pommell had said to Palmer was: ""Look, what's happening."" She reminded the jury that his evidence was that he (Palmer) then ran up the street and shot the victim because he believed the victim had stabbed his friend. The judge therefore fully set out Palmer's version of events. She explained that the thrust of the cross-examination was about what they, the jury, had to decide, that is what happened in Rupert Street and the nightclub. She itemised some of those issues: Why had Palmer chased anyone? Why did he get close enough to ensure that he would hit somebody? And why was his account now different from the account that he had initially given. The judge referred to other matters with which the cross-examination had been concerned. We have read the passages about which particular complaint is made. We are satisfied that there is no justifiable basis for criticising the fairness of the summing-up. Both the prosecution case and the defence case were put to the jury. It was made clear that it was for them to decide what they were sure happened that night. The evidence of Palmer was fairly summarised and the jury were left to consider the truthfulness of his account. This ground of appeal is not arguable. We turn then to the new further grounds of appeal. It is said that the judge failed accurately to direct the jury and in particular failed to direct them on the law of commands and the need for a causative link, as Dr Gerry put it, between the order or the instruction that Pommell was alleged to have given and the actions of Palmer in shooting the victim. We have had some difficulty in understanding this ground of appeal. We have summarised the issues that the judge set out already. They were that the jury had to be sure that the applicant, Pommell, was aware that Palmer had a gun, that they had to be sure that Pommell the applicant shared the intention with Palmer that the gun should be used to kill and that they had to be sure that the applicant encouraged or assisted Palmer in the carrying out of the joint venture. We note that the directions were agreed by the prosecution and the defence counsel at trial. The applicant's trial counsel has been asked for his comments on this matter and he confirms that the defence did not consider the directions to be deficient. Dr Gerry this morning put her case on this matter essentially in one of two ways. First, she submitted that in the way that she analysed the way the case had been put by the prosecution it was a critical part of the case that Pommell transferred the gun to Palmer and instructed or ordered Palmer to go and shoot the victim. The first way in which we understood Dr Gerry to put the case was that, given that factual matrix, the directions about encouraging and assisting were insufficient and there had to be directions tailored to Dr Gerry analysis of the case, that is what she described as the issues of command and causation. The second way that Dr Gerry put the case was that the directions the judge gave were simply incorrect as a matter of law. The thrust of that submission appeared to be that on analysis the assistance and encouragement in this case did amount to commanding or procuring the murder and therefore the judge should, as a matter of law, have given the directions required as if the indictment had included a a charge of procuring. We have read the directions given by the judge. We do not accept the submissions of Dr Gerry. We do not see that the directions were in any way deficient. They made it clear that the question was whether the jury were sure that the applicant Pommell knew that Palmer had a gun, that Pommell intended the gun be used to kill someone and that Pommell encouraged or assisted Palmer in that enterprise. The case was not that the applicant procured the commission of the offence, it is that he participated in it with the necessary intention by encouraging or assisting the commission of the offence. This ground of appeal is not arguable. Next it is said that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence and that the outcomes are inconsistent. We do not see any realistic basis for this argument. The verdicts are in fact perfectly consistent. The jury were sure that the applicant encouraged or assisted in the attempted murder by Palmer of the victim. They were not sure that Pommell possessed the gun with intent to endanger life. The verdict is not against the weight of the evidence. For those reasons, we do not see that any of the grounds of appeal against conviction are arguable. For completeness we note that we have read the new evidence which the applicant seeks to adduce. We have heard submissions from Dr Gerry on the new evidence. We are not satisfied that it satisfies the criteria under section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and we would not admit it. The new evidence does not in any way event cast any doubt on the safety of the conviction. Turning to sentence, the applicant was convicted of an offence of attempted murder. The judge correctly categorised this as a Category A2 case under the sentencing guidelines applicable at the time of the sentence. Those guidelines provided for a starting point of 30 years' imprisonment and a range of 25 to 35 years' imprisonment. The judge considered that the applicant was the prime mover in this crime. Palmer fired the gun and shot the victim. But the judge considered Pommell was the main motivator behind the attempted murder. We see no inconsistency with that conclusion and the finding that he was a facilitator in the sense of assisting or encouraging Palmer. It is perfectly possible to assist and encourage but in reality to be the main motivator behind the attempted murder. Having conducted the trial, the judge was well-placed to assess the relevant culpability of Palmer and Pommell. She was well-placed to assess the fact that the prime mover in this attempted killing of a man was the applicant Pommell. We doubt that the judge was entitled to take into account her view that the applicant had a gun in the nightclub given that the jury had not convicted him of that offence and had been unable to reach a verdict on that offence. We do not think it was helpful of the judge to speculate as to why the jury were unable to reach a verdict on count 2. But having said that, the question for this court is whether the sentence is manifestly excessive. We do not consider that it was even arguably manifestly excessive. It was well within the guidelines. It was below the starting point. There was no inconsistency with Palmer. The starting point in his case was 24 years before the particular mitigation in his case was taken into account, rather than 26 years, and although he did the actual shooting the judge was satisfied that the applicant was the prime mover behind the attempted murder. A sentence of 26 years is well within the appropriate sentencing range and is a just and proportionate sentence for this offence of attempted murder. We refuse permission to appeal against sentence. For those reasons the applications for leave to adduce fresh evidence and the applications for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence are refused.

The jury were unable to agree a verdict on a second offence of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. On 26 January 2022 the applicant was sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment. The applicant was refused leave by the single judge to appeal against conviction and sentence. He renews his application for leave to appeal both against conviction and sentence today. He also seeks leave to amend his grounds. He seeks leave in addition to adduce fresh evidence in the form of a number of witness statements. He has been represented today by Dr Gerry KC who has very fully developed the original grounds and the amended grounds by reference to a wide range of materials. The facts can be stated shortly. On the evening of 24 August 2019 (a Saturday) a private event was taking place at a nightclub in Rupert Street, Soho, London. The applicant and another man, Richard Palmer, attended the event. They arrived at 00.30 on the morning of Sunday 25 August 2019. A fight broke out. During the course of that fight an individual was stabbed. The event was closed down and everyone was required to leave the venue. Outside the venue Palmer ran down the street and shot the victim twice in the back. Palmer was charged with attempted murder. The prosecution case was that Palmer did not act alone. It was said that Pommell had assisted and encouraged Palmer. That was count 1 on the indictment. The prosecution also alleged that Pommell had had the gun in his possession at some stage during the night. That formed the subject matter of count 2 on the indictment. There had earlier been a trial in relation to this incident. At that earlier trial three men were accused of various charges. First, Pommell and Palmer were charged with attempted murder. Secondly, Pommell and Palmer were charged with possession of a firearm, a .22 Beretta pistol. Thirdly, Pommell, Palmer and a third man, Roberts, were charged with transfer of a prohibited firearm. Palmer had initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges. On 10 October 2020 Palmer changed his plea and pleaded guilty to attempted murder. On 14 January 2021 he pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. At the earlier trial Pommell pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and possession of a firearm. The jury could not reach a verdict at that earlier trial hence the need for a retrial on those two counts. In relation to the third count, transfer of a prohibited weapon, this was an allegation that in the evening of 24 August 2019 Pommell, Palmer and Roberts had been together at a house in Coleridge Drive and Roberts had handed the Beretta pistol to the others. Roberts had never been at the nightclub so any transfer of the gun from him to the other two must have happened before Palmer and Pommell got to the nightclub. All three defendants were acquitted of the count of transfer of the prohibited weapon. Turning to the retrial, which is the subject matter of this application, Pommell was charged with attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. As indicated, the prosecution case was that Palmer was the shooter, that he did not act alone and Pommell was a secondary party as he encouraged or assisted Palmer in the attempted murder. The prosecution also alleged that Pommell had been in possession of the gun that evening in the nightclub and he (Pommell) had handed it over to Palmer outside the club. The prosecution relied upon a number of strands of evidence. Among them was CCTV footage from inside and outside the nightclub and video footage from dash board cameras from cars in the street. The prosecution said that the footage showed Pommell and Palmer standing by Pommell's car and showed Pommell pointing up the street, Palmer running up the street, stopping, looking back to Pommell, Pommell pointing and then Palmer shooting the victim twice. The prosecution also relied upon Pommell's failure to give evidence at trial as evidence supporting their case. The defence case was that the applicant knew nothing of any planned violence. He did not participate or direct or encourage Palmer to shoot anyone. He was not aware that Palmer had a gun. He relied on a number of witnesses. These included the co-host of the party who was standing by Pommell outside the nightclub later. That person said he did not see the applicant with the gun and that he did not consider the applicant had encouraged Palmer to shoot anyone. Critically, Palmer (the man who admitted shooting the victim) was also called as a witness on Pommell's behalf. He gave evidence that he had shot the victim and that Pommell was not involved.

These included the fact that he had been talking to Pommell by the car, that Pommell was pointing down the street, that Palmer had run down the street looked back at Pommell and then turned and shot the victim. It was put to Palmer that in his defence statement made prior to his change of plea to guilty to attempted murder, Palmer had said that he had taken drugs and alcohol and was paranoid. He had heard men screaming and shouting and so ran towards the noise and shot one of them. It was put to him that he had never said in his defence statement anything about him having shot the victim because he believed erroneously that the victim had stabbed his friend. He had never said anything about being told that his friend had been stabbed. He was also asked about the shooting itself. Palmer said that he had taken the gun from a bag he was carrying and he had shot the victim. He was asked when he loaded the gun. Palmer said that it had been loaded earlier in that evening before he had left the house and he had carried it loaded throughout the evening even though it did not have a safety catch. It was put to him that he was giving evidence now at Pommell's bidding in effect to exonerate Pommell but he effectively denied that. At one stage the defence applied to admit evidence of the fact that Palmer had been acquitted at the first trial of the offence of transferring the gun. The judge refused leave to adduce the evidence of the acquittal. On the attempted murder charge the issues for the jury were identified by the judge as follows: Were they sure that the applicant Pommell was aware that Palmer had a gun in his possession when he set off up the road? If they were sure that Pommell knew Palmer had the gun, were they sure that he shared the intention with Palmer that the gun should be used to kill? Did the applicant encourage or assist Palmer in the carrying out of the joint venture with the intention of killing the victim? In relation to count 2 and possession of a firearm with intention to endanger life, the judge identified the issues for the jury as follows: Did the applicant possess the Beretta pistol? Did he intend at any stage during the night of 24/25 to endanger life? The jury convicted the applicant on count 1, attempted murder, but were unable to reach a verdict on count 2. The applicant was sentenced on 26 January 2022 to 26 years' imprisonment. It was agreed and the judge accepted that the case fell within Category A2 of the Sentencing Council Guidelines for attempted murder. The judge considered that the applicant was the prime mover and the motivator behind the attack. The judge also considered that there was a degree of planning as the gun was brought to the scene. She considered that the applicant did have a gun in his possession in the nightclub during the course of the night, notwithstanding the fact that the jury had been unable to reach a verdict on that matter. The judge noted that the applicant had no previous convictions for violence. The starting point under the recently issued guidelines was 30 years. The judge took into account that various matters had led to the sentencing of Pommell taking place after the introduction of those guidelines, whereas Palmer had been sentenced under earlier guidelines. She considered the sentence she had imposed in Palmer's case where she had taken a starting point of 24 years and then reduced that to reflect the particular mitigation in Palmer's case. She the imposed a sentence on Pommell of 26 years' imprisonment. We deal first with the application for leave to appeal against conviction. We start with consideration of the question of the safety of the conviction. The applicant originally applied for leave to appeal against conviction on two grounds. Leave to appeal was refused by the single judge. The applicant instructed fresh counsel and made a renewed application with additional grounds. The first ground is that the judge was wrong not to allow the defence to adduce details of Palmer's acquittal at the trial. In the first set of grounds, also adopted by Dr Gerry today, it was put on the basis that whilst it was proper to cross-examine Palmer on matters to do with the contents of the defence statement, it was correct and proper in that context to adduce the details of the first trial and the acquittal. In the revised grounds it is put on the basis that if the acquittal at trial of the applicant had been admitted in evidence it would have demonstrated that Palmer must have been believed by the jury. Dr Gerry expanded on those submissions this morning. Her essential submission was that the prosecution had explored the possibility of the transfer of the gun in a number of ways during the trial and she submitted it was therefore relevant for the jury to hear about the acquittal on the transfer of the gun and secondly that it would have undermined the prosecution case and support Mr Pommell's case. On the second way of putting it, it is submitted that had the jury known of the acquittal of Mr Palmer that would or might have boosted his credibility in the eyes of the jury. We see no basis in this ground of appeal. The first point to note is that the question of the acquittal in relation to the transfer of the gun concerned the question solely of whether the gun had been handed over to Pommell and Palmer by Roberts on the evening of 24 August 2019. Although Dr Gerry refers to parts of the summing-up at the first trial which records Mr Pommell's case that he denied having the gun at any stage in the night, it is clear that the issue at the first trial must have included transfer prior to the nightclub because Mr Roberts never went to the nightclub. The first point to note then is that the acquittal related to the question of transfer from Roberts to Pommell and Palmer which logically is likely to have been at Coleridge Drive and not at a later stage in the evening. Secondly, as a general rule, evidence of an acquittal is not admissible as it is not legally relevant. That is the position here. The fact that the jury in the first trial were not sure that the gun was handed over by Roberts earlier on in the evening of 24 August 2019 is not legally relevant to the events concerning the shooting in the early morning of 25 August 2019. Thirdly, there is no question of the matter going to the credibility of Palmer. He did not give evidence at the first trial and there could have been no possibility of a jury having believed what he said in evidence for the simple reason that he did not give evidence. The second ground of appeal in the original grounds was that the summing-up was unfair. That ground was essentially an assertion that the judge had focused not on what Palmer's evidence was but dealt largely or exclusively with the criticism of it by the prosecution. In the perfected original grounds attention is drawn to three particular comments made by the judge. Dr Gerry in oral submission this morning took us to other passages in which it is submitted that the judge gave an unbalanced and flawed approach which in effect prevented the jury from fairly assessing Palmer's evidence. We have read the entirety of the summing-up. The judge very clearly set out the nature of the applicant's case early on in the summing-up. She said that the applicant through counsel and his witnesses said that he knew nothing of any planned violence. He said he did not participate, far less direct, organise or encourage Palmer or anyone else for that matter to do harm to anyone that night. The judge identified the critical issues in the case. She then summarised the prosecution evidence. In relation to the fact that the applicant was pointing up the street, she reminded the jury of the evidence that others were also pointing. She dealt with the evidence called on behalf of the applicant, starting with Mr Sinclair and then the Entessania sisters. The judge then dealt with the evidence of Palmer. She explained why the jury had heard evidence of Palmer's criminal convictions. She summarised his evidence-in-chief including how he said that he acquired the gun. She reminded the jury that Palmer had said that Pommell had picked him up and Palmer had not told him that he, Palmer, had a gun. Palmer said the gun was in his bag and that was in the car. She reminded the jury that Palmer's evidence was that he saw his friend in a commotion, that the friend stumbled into the road and someone had told him that the friend had been stabbed. She reminded them of Palmer's evidence that at this point all that Pommell had said to Palmer was: ""Look, what's happening."" She reminded the jury that his evidence was that he (Palmer) then ran up the street and shot the victim because he believed the victim had stabbed his friend. The judge therefore fully set out Palmer's version of events. She explained that the thrust of the cross-examination was about what they, the jury, had to decide, that is what happened in Rupert Street and the nightclub. She itemised some of those issues: Why had Palmer chased anyone? Why did he get close enough to ensure that he would hit somebody? And why was his account now different from the account that he had initially given. The judge referred to other matters with which the cross-examination had been concerned. We have read the passages about which particular complaint is made. We are satisfied that there is no justifiable basis for criticising the fairness of the summing-up. Both the prosecution case and the defence case were put to the jury. It was made clear that it was for them to decide what they were sure happened that night. The evidence of Palmer was fairly summarised and the jury were left to consider the truthfulness of his account. This ground of appeal is not arguable. We turn then to the new further grounds of appeal. It is said that the judge failed accurately to direct the jury and in particular failed to direct them on the law of commands and the need for a causative link, as Dr Gerry put it, between the order or the instruction that Pommell was alleged to have given and the actions of Palmer in shooting the victim. We have had some difficulty in understanding this ground of appeal. We have summarised the issues that the judge set out already. They were that the jury had to be sure that the applicant, Pommell, was aware that Palmer had a gun, that they had to be sure that Pommell the applicant shared the intention with Palmer that the gun should be used to kill and that they had to be sure that the applicant encouraged or assisted Palmer in the carrying out of the joint venture. We note that the directions were agreed by the prosecution and the defence counsel at trial. The applicant's trial counsel has been asked for his comments on this matter and he confirms that the defence did not consider the directions to be deficient. Dr Gerry this morning put her case on this matter essentially in one of two ways. First, she submitted that in the way that she analysed the way the case had been put by the prosecution it was a critical part of the case that Pommell transferred the gun to Palmer and instructed or ordered Palmer to go and shoot the victim. The first way in which we understood Dr Gerry to put the case was that, given that factual matrix, the directions about encouraging and assisting were insufficient and there had to be directions tailored to Dr Gerry analysis of the case, that is what she described as the issues of command and causation. The second way that Dr Gerry put the case was that the directions the judge gave were simply incorrect as a matter of law. The thrust of that submission appeared to be that on analysis the assistance and encouragement in this case did amount to commanding or procuring the murder and therefore the judge should, as a matter of law, have given the directions required as if the indictment had included a a charge of procuring. We have read the directions given by the judge. We do not accept the submissions of Dr Gerry. We do not see that the directions were in any way deficient. They made it clear that the question was whether the jury were sure that the applicant Pommell knew that Palmer had a gun, that Pommell intended the gun be used to kill someone and that Pommell encouraged or assisted Palmer in that enterprise. The case was not that the applicant procured the commission of the offence, it is that he participated in it with the necessary intention by encouraging or assisting the commission of the offence. This ground of appeal is not arguable. Next it is said that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence and that the outcomes are inconsistent. We do not see any realistic basis for this argument. The verdicts are in fact perfectly consistent. The jury were sure that the applicant encouraged or assisted in the attempted murder by Palmer of the victim. They were not sure that Pommell possessed the gun with intent to endanger life. The verdict is not against the weight of the evidence. For those reasons, we do not see that any of the grounds of appeal against conviction are arguable. For completeness we note that we have read the new evidence which the applicant seeks to adduce. We have heard submissions from Dr Gerry on the new evidence. We are not satisfied that it satisfies the criteria under section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and we would not admit it. The new evidence does not in any way event cast any doubt on the safety of the conviction. Turning to sentence, the applicant was convicted of an offence of attempted murder. The judge correctly categorised this as a Category A2 case under the sentencing guidelines applicable at the time of the sentence. Those guidelines provided for a starting point of 30 years' imprisonment and a range of 25 to 35 years' imprisonment. The judge considered that the applicant was the prime mover in this crime. Palmer fired the gun and shot the victim. But the judge considered Pommell was the main motivator behind the attempted murder. We see no inconsistency with that conclusion and the finding that he was a facilitator in the sense of assisting or encouraging Palmer. It is perfectly possible to assist and encourage but in reality to be the main motivator behind the attempted murder. Having conducted the trial, the judge was well-placed to assess the relevant culpability of Palmer and Pommell. She was well-placed to assess the fact that the prime mover in this attempted killing of a man was the applicant Pommell. We doubt that the judge was entitled to take into account her view that the applicant had a gun in the nightclub given that the jury had not convicted him of that offence and had been unable to reach a verdict on that offence. We do not think it was helpful of the judge to speculate as to why the jury were unable to reach a verdict on count 2. But having said that, the question for this court is whether the sentence is manifestly excessive. We do not consider that it was even arguably manifestly excessive. It was well within the guidelines. It was below the starting point. There was no inconsistency with Palmer. The starting point in his case was 24 years before the particular mitigation in his case was taken into account, rather than 26 years, and although he did the actual shooting the judge was satisfied that the applicant was the prime mover behind the attempted murder. A sentence of 26 years is well within the appropriate sentencing range and is a just and proportionate sentence for this offence of attempted murder. We refuse permission to appeal against sentence. For those reasons the applications for leave to adduce fresh evidence and the applications for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence are refused."

We grant leave. The offender was born in May 1985 and is now 19 years of age. On 30th September 2004 he pleaded guilty to murder of a woman called Corinne Bailey and to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Julie Francis, both of those offences being committed within a comparatively short space of time on 16th August 2003. He was sentenced by Astill J, at the Central Criminal Court, to custody for life for murder, with a minimum term specified of 14 years, less the 1 year and three days which he had spent in custody, that is to say, the term to be served was 12 years and 362 days. That sentence was, of course, imposed in relation to the offence of murder. A sentence of 8 years custody concurrent was imposed for the attempted grievous bodily harm. The circumstances were that the victim of the lesser offence, Julie Francis, was 39 years old and, for some months before she was attacked by the offender, she had offered sexual services to passersby on streets in Croydon, near where the offender lived. But it was her practice, having obtained money in advance, to leave without engaging in any sexual activity. In the early hours of 16th August 2003, under the influence of crack cocaine, prescribed drugs and alcohol, she was working in this way in London Road, Croydon, together with another woman. About 2.30 in the morning the two of them were standing outside a 24 hour shop on London Road. The offender walked past them and gestured to Julie Francis to follow him. She did so. They exchanged names (in both cases false) and she invited him into an alleyway on the other side of the road. Once there, he began to undo his trousers and exposed his penis. She told him she wanted the money upfront. The offender said: ""You ain't getting any fucking money. You ain't going nowhere"". He punched her hard in the face with his fist and pushed her down, by pressure on her throat, making her sit down. He then tightened his grip on her. She took what cash she had and threw it at him. But he did not take it. He carried on holding her throat. She began to feel weak. She said he kept saying: ""You're going to die"", although he was later to deny saying this. She grabbed his hand, screamed for help and begged him to stop. He put his hand over her face and kept hold of her throat. He then came close enough to her for her to bite his neck. He squeezed her throat harder and she believed she must have lost consciousness for a short while. When she came round, the offender was standing over her with his penis exposed and erect. She screamed at him. He ran away. She shouted after him ""Why?"" He shouted back: ""You're a prostitute"". She chased him, believing that she had been raped and she shouted ""rape"". She sought assistance from a group of young men, one of whom called the police and another of whom helped to chase the offender but he got away. The injuries which Julie Francis sustained in this attack included bruising over her left cheekbone and the bridge of her nose and tenderness of her neck. At first she refused medical attention and discharged herself from hospital. But, after she heard what had happened later that day, so far as the offender was concerned, she submitted to a medical examination. The victim of the murder was a 38 year old woman called Corinne Bailey. She was a married woman with two children, and lived in a flat in Campbell Road, Croydon, which was just off London Road and near the same 24 hour shop to which we earlier referred. A CCTV video camera captured her walking from Campbell Road towards the 24 hour shop, shortly after 4.00 am on 13th August. It also captured her returning towards Campbell Road with a carrier bag. As she returned, the offender was captured on the video, running out of Greenside Road, where he lived, carrying a long piece of wood and running in the direction of Campbell Road, where Corinne Bailey had gone. About quarter-of-an-hour later, he ran out from Campbell Road. Corinne Bailey's body was discovered at about 7.40 am by a passerby. She was lying in a pool of blood, covered in blood, near a parked car in Campbell Road, about 500 metres from the place where Julie Francis had been attacked. Her lower clothing had been removed. Her purse and goods which she had bought from the shop were nearby. There was a bloodstained length of wood nearby. Postmortem examination revealed that she had no less than 68 external injuries. She had been subjected to a violent and sustained attack with a blunt object, involving multiple blows to her head, neck and upper chest. The hyoid bones and cartilages in the neck were fractured, as were a number of facial bones. She had bruises on her face, consistent with punches or kicks. She also bore the marks of gripping, indicating restraint. Her bra was torn and there was a tear to her vulva, indicating a sexually motivated attack involving attempted vaginal penetration. The offender was arrested on 27th September, in Brighton. In interview, he said he had been out drinking with friends on 15th August and could not remember exactly what he had done, or indeed where he had gone. He thought he had got back to his grandparents address in Greenside Road between 2.00 and 3.00 in the morning. On 29th September he was picked out on an identification parade by Julie Francis as being the man who had attacked her. The offender said that she must be mistaken. At a plea and directions hearing, on 17th December 2003, the offender pleaded not guilty to murder and attempted murder. Subsequently, overwhelming DNA and fibre evidence was obtained which demonstrated a connection between him and the deceased. The trial was fixed for 27th September 2004. It appears that, in June, he had conceded to those representing him that he was responsible for the attacks and, from that time, the witnesses knew that there would not be an issue in relation to that aspect of the matter. During the week before 27th September, it was indicated that he would plead guilty to murder and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. On 30th September the case was listed for that purpose, and he so pleaded. He has only one previous conviction, for theft, in May 2003. There was a psychiatric report before the judge, which indicated that the offender was unable to provide any explanation for his attack on Julie Francis other than that he realised she was a prostitute. He denied saying he was going to kill her, but he had called her, he said,'a slag'. In relation to Corinne Bailey, the offender said he had seen her walking with a bag and had got an urge to run over and hit her. It was not until he had struck the first blow to her head with the wood that he realised she was female. He did not know why he did not stop then. He denied, at that stage, intending to kill her, but no such lack of intent was in due course advanced by way of mitigation. He was not, in the view of the psychiatrist, suffering from any abnormality of mind or mental characteristics capable of providing any defence to murder. The mitigation advanced on his behalf included his plea of guilty and his age, which was just over 18 at the time of the offence and just over 19 at sentence. Once he had admitted the offences, he had expressed remorse. It was emphasised that, although his conduct was plainly sexually motivated, he had not penetrated either woman with his penis; it was said that the injury to the deceased's vulva was manual rather than penile. On behalf of the Attorney-General, Mr Ellison draws attention to what he rightly submits are a number of aggravating features. First, the attack was sexually motivated and involved sexual maltreatment and violence. Secondly, the offender pursued the victim, having armed himself with the piece of wood. Thirdly, he used gratuitous and extreme violence, inflicting multiple injuries, including, in the course of the attack, the use of the weapon, punches and stamping. Fourthly, the murder was committed about 2 hours after his attack on the other woman, by hitting and squeezing her throat, in the course of a sexually motivated attack believing that she was a prostitute. In the light of those aggravating circumstances and in the light of the terms of the relevant Practice Direction, (this being an offence committed prior to December 2003, and therefore being one to which the transitional provisions apply, as set out in the Practice Direction (Crime Mandatory Life Sentences) (No 2) direction of 29th July 2004), Mr Ellison accepts - and this is not contested by Miss Elizabeth Marsh QC on behalf of the offender - that the starting point of 20 years, adopted by the learned judge, was an appropriate one. The judge was entitled to start at 15 to 16 years, as identified in IV.49.26 of the Practice Direction, and then to take into account the aggravating features which justify the upward variation of that starting point. The submissions to this Court have focused on the extent to which the learned judge was then justified in reducing his figure of 20 years to the figure of 14 years. Mr Ellison, on behalf of the Attorney-General, accepts that there are two mitigating features which are relevant. First, the plea of guilty, at the stage and in the circumstances to which we have referred, and secondly, the age of the offender. But, he submits, the figure of 14 years at which the judge arrived, taking those matters into account, was unduly lenient and failed adequately to reflect the seriousness of the crime and to deter others. Miss Marsh, on behalf of the offender, submits that, although the 14 year term could, perhaps, be characterised as generous, it ought not, properly, to be characterised as unduly lenient. She stresses the youth of the offender, in relation to whom, had the offence been committed a little earlier and had a different Practice Direction applied, the starting point would only have been 12 years. As it seems to us, we have to apply the Practice Direction in relation to this offence at the time when it was committed, having regard to the offender's age. But we accept that the offender's age is a matter which properly reduces the figure of 20 years. We also accept that the plea of guilty, in the circumstances and at the time at which it was entered, calls for a discount from the 20 year figure. As it seems to us, the total discount from that 20 year figure, appropriate in this case would have been 4 years, made up as to about 18 months, in relation to the plea of guilty and as to about two-and-a-half years by reference to the offender's age. The 14 year term specified by the judge therefore appears to us to be unduly lenient. Although this is an Attorney-General's Reference, the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, by a new subsection (3)A, in section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, have removed in minimum term cases, consideration of the element of double jeopardy which normally arises on an Attorney-General's Reference. Accordingly, we quash the term of 14 years and we substitute for it a term of 16 years custody. The offender will be credited, as against that figure, with the 1 year and three days which he had spent in custody, in relation to the offence of murder. He will therefore serve a term of 14 years and 362 days instead of the 12 years and 362 days ordered by the judge.

The mitigation advanced on his behalf included his plea of guilty and his age, which was just over 18 at the time of the offence and just over 19 at sentence. Once he had admitted the offences, he had expressed remorse. It was emphasised that, although his conduct was plainly sexually motivated, he had not penetrated either woman with his penis; it was said that the injury to the deceased's vulva was manual rather than penile. On behalf of the Attorney-General, Mr Ellison draws attention to what he rightly submits are a number of aggravating features. First, the attack was sexually motivated and involved sexual maltreatment and violence. Secondly, the offender pursued the victim, having armed himself with the piece of wood. Thirdly, he used gratuitous and extreme violence, inflicting multiple injuries, including, in the course of the attack, the use of the weapon, punches and stamping. Fourthly, the murder was committed about 2 hours after his attack on the other woman, by hitting and squeezing her throat, in the course of a sexually motivated attack believing that she was a prostitute. In the light of those aggravating circumstances and in the light of the terms of the relevant Practice Direction, (this being an offence committed prior to December 2003, and therefore being one to which the transitional provisions apply, as set out in the Practice Direction (Crime Mandatory Life Sentences) (No 2) direction of 29th July 2004), Mr Ellison accepts - and this is not contested by Miss Elizabeth Marsh QC on behalf of the offender - that the starting point of 20 years, adopted by the learned judge, was an appropriate one. The judge was entitled to start at 15 to 16 years, as identified in IV.49.26 of the Practice Direction, and then to take into account the aggravating features which justify the upward variation of that starting point. The submissions to this Court have focused on the extent to which the learned judge was then justified in reducing his figure of 20 years to the figure of 14 years. Mr Ellison, on behalf of the Attorney-General, accepts that there are two mitigating features which are relevant. First, the plea of guilty, at the stage and in the circumstances to which we have referred, and secondly, the age of the offender. But, he submits, the figure of 14 years at which the judge arrived, taking those matters into account, was unduly lenient and failed adequately to reflect the seriousness of the crime and to deter others. Miss Marsh, on behalf of the offender, submits that, although the 14 year term could, perhaps, be characterised as generous, it ought not, properly, to be characterised as unduly lenient. She stresses the youth of the offender, in relation to whom, had the offence been committed a little earlier and had a different Practice Direction applied, the starting point would only have been 12 years. As it seems to us, we have to apply the Practice Direction in relation to this offence at the time when it was committed, having regard to the offender's age. But we accept that the offender's age is a matter which properly reduces the figure of 20 years. We also accept that the plea of guilty, in the circumstances and at the time at which it was entered, calls for a discount from the 20 year figure. As it seems to us, the total discount from that 20 year figure, appropriate in this case would have been 4 years, made up as to about 18 months, in relation to the plea of guilty and as to about two-and-a-half years by reference to the offender's age. The 14 year term specified by the judge therefore appears to us to be unduly lenient. Although this is an Attorney-General's Reference, the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, by a new subsection (3)A, in section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, have removed in minimum term cases, consideration of the element of double jeopardy which normally arises on an Attorney-General's Reference. Accordingly, we quash the term of 14 years and we substitute for it a term of 16 years custody. The offender will be credited, as against that figure, with the 1 year and three days which he had spent in custody, in relation to the offence of murder. He will therefore serve a term of 14 years and 362 days instead of the 12 years and 362 days ordered by the judge."

She suffered a terrible death. She was slowly strangled to death with her own clothing and just before or just after she died she was raped. Her lifeless body was found on the following morning in her car which was parked in the back yard of the Tom Tackle public house. On 5 February 1982, at Winchester Crown Court, before Sheldon J and a jury, the appellant was convicted of this murder. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life. Today, 27 years later, his conviction will be quashed. It is not safe. We must face reality. The first inescapable and appalling consequence is that the appellant has been in custody for 27 years on the basis of an unsafe conviction. The second highly distressing consequence is that some very old wounds will have been re-opened for the family of the dead girl, and her mother in particular. The third consequence is that there will be understandable public concern as to how this has come about, which means that the judgment of the court should set out a full account of the extraordinary circumstances of the case. In the broad public interest, therefore, we must endeavour to set out the facts as they are currently known to us, in order for the community at large to understand how this conviction came about, why it must be quashed, and how it was that these disturbing events took place. We should however emphasise at the outset that, unlike many other miscarriages of justice, this conviction is not being quashed because some unacceptable feature of police misconduct during the course of the investigation has now emerged, or that any witness who gave evidence at trial was untruthful or mistaken, or even that anything done by anyone at the trial, seen in the light of the evidence as it then stood, is open to criticism. The conviction will be quashed for the simple reason that advances in the science of DNA, long after the end of the trial, have proved a fact which, if it had been known at the time, would, notwithstanding the remaining evidence in the case, have resulted in a quite different investigation and a completely different trial. The point, dealt with very shortly for the moment, is that swabs taken from the dead girl at about 11am on the morning of 5 December 1979 have been re-examined. There are sufficient remnants of sperm on them for proper DNA analysis. The conclusion is that the sperm on the swabs did not come from the appellant. Whoever it was who raped the dead girl, on these findings it was not and cannot have been the appellant. The Crown's case at trial was that the man who raped the dead girl was also responsible for killing her. The new DNA evidence has therefore demolished the case for the prosecution. We must set out the facts in more detail. The deceased was working in the evening of 4 December 1979 at the Tom Tackle public house. It was a two night a week part-time job, to supplement her full-time employment as a clerk. She finished work at just after 11pm and, together with a female friend, went to a night club. They used the friend's car. She left her own Ford Escort in the car park at the Tom Tackle. At the club the two young women were together all the time. The deceased consumed soft drinks. After spending time at the club, they returned to the car park at about 1am on 5 December. After dropping the deceased off, her colleague then went home. At about that time, and shortly afterwards, a number of witnesses heard screaming and the banging of car doors. At about the same time, another witness saw a man walking near the scene of the murder who appeared to be vomiting near to some railings. The Crown's case was that the appellant, under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep on the back seat. When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto the back seat and brushed against the appellant. He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased. In the morning of 5 December the landlord of the Tom Tackle was expecting a delivery, and it became necessary for him to try to move the deceased's car. He discovered the deceased and telephoned the police. Officers arrived at the scene, followed by the pathologist at about 11.45am. The pathologist described the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting against the back of the seat, and the left thigh running along the edge of the seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well. Six swabs were collected at the scene: a low and high vaginal swab, two anal swabs, a mouth swab and a control swab. The pathologist concluded that the cause of death was strangulation. However, a number of specific features of his findings are relevant to the issues which arise in this case. The air passages of the deceased were congested and contained abundant white frothy mucous. His evidence was that foam coming from the mouth of a victim of strangulation was not a feature of every strangulation, or even of most strangulations. It was a feature only of the long, slow strangulation from which this deceased had died. There were a series of multiple, roughly horizontal, linear, bruised abrasions on the front of the neck, approximately ten separate marks in all, and the pattern of the abrasions matched the description of the chain which the deceased had been said to be wearing that evening. There was no finger-mark bruising on the deceased of the sort which is sometimes associated with manual strangulations. The abrasions were consistent with the clothing having been gripped and twisted against the neck. In addition, there was damage to her genitalia: bruising at the back of the left outer lip of the vagina and a half-inch split on the posterior wall. The anus was swollen and the lower margins intensely congested. The buttocks were stained with blood and dirt. Semen was present in the vagina, in sufficient concentration to indicate that it had been present no more than three to four hours before death. No one suggested that the semen could have come from anyone other than the rapist. The vaginal swabs were tested and found to contain semen. The blood in the semen matched the blood group of the appellant, group A. The deceased belonged to blood group B. Grouping tests performed on the high and low vaginal swabs gave reactions for blood groups AB. This result could have been due to the secretions from the deceased with semen from a man with blood groups A or AB. In addition, a blood stain recovered from a Jay cloth found on the front seat of the car was also blood group A. However, as roughly 30% of the population belong to that blood group, the blood grouping did not prove that the appellant was the source of the blood, although it was consistent with his group and did not exclude him. A search of the car produced a black comb from the rear offside well. The victim's handbag and other belongings were found in various places in the locality. Her car keys and jewellery, which included a watch, rings, and a gold chain with a crucifix, could not be found. Jewellery of a similar design was later depicted in newspaper articles. The appellant was 28 years old. He had numerous previous convictions for offences of dishonesty and deception, as well as many related to offences involving motor vehicles. There was one conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse and another for being in possession of an offensive weapon. There were however no convictions for offences of violence. There is no doubt that even at that stage he was a disturbed personality, with a history of significant self-harming. We now know, and would admit in evidence, that he attended a clinic in 1978 after several incidents of overdosing. He was assessed as having ""a severe personality disorder"" and he was a ""compulsive liar"". He went to Southampton on 4 December, the day of the murder, and booked into a hostel. He was later to say that he had visited the area of the Tom Tackle public house that evening. On 6 December he was arrested for an offence of theft from a motor vehicle. He was found in possession of property stolen from a car. On 7 December he said that he wanted to give some information about the Tom Tackle murder, which had naturally excited a good deal of media interest in the area. He made an allegation against an individual purporting to indicate that that individual appeared to have been involved in the offence. This man, however, was blood group O, and so he was eliminated from inquiries. On 9 December 1979 the appellant was charged with offences of theft and remanded in custody. He was interviewed by detectives on several occasions in relation to this murder, but he was not seen as a suspect at that time. However, because of his blood group, and in view of his allegations, police inquiries were made into his whereabouts on the night of the murder. His movements at the time of the killing could not be verified or corroborated. On 16 May 1980 the appellant made a further statement about the man against whom he had made the earlier allegations. On the same day he pleaded guilty at Southampton to theft. Sentence was deferred. He was granted conditional bail. He was arrested in London on 4 June 1980 and charged with other offences. Some keys were found on him at this time. On 14 July 1980 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. On this occasion he admitted a large number of relatively minor offences. He could not have committed all of them. Some had occurred while he was in custody. By now there had been a huge amount of coverage of the murder both in the local press and on television and radio news. The coverage included details, but not all the relevant evidential features, of the murder and the rape, the theft of property from the deceased, and included a picture of an oval-shaped watch. Confessions The appellant's confessions were crucial to his conviction. The Crown did not rely on the confessions as such. They focused on the detail provided in the confessions which, on the Crown's case, could only have been known to the man who was responsible for the crime. They relied on other matters as supportive of the confessions, such as the findings consistent with the appellant's blood group, and his undoubted presence in the locality at the relevant time. It is perhaps worth emphasising that it was never suggested at any stage in the trial, or indeed in any material which we have seen, either that any one of the individuals who reported that the appellant had made a confession to him was lying or mistaken about the fact and terms of the confession, nor that anyone to whom he had made a confession, including in particular the police, had behaved improperly by bullying or pressurising him in any way at all. In other words, on the evidence before the jury it was not disputed that everything that he was reported to have said had been said by him and that what he had said was voluntary. Obviously, so far as his own written admissions are concerned, he wrote them and they too were voluntary. The appellant was not linked to this murder until he confessed to it on 11 December 1980 when he asked to see a priest. In this first confession the appellant said that he was having nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed kept coming back to him. The killing, he said, had happened in Southampton about twelve months earlier. He told the priest that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death. The next day, after seeing a solicitor, the appellant told a prison officer that he had confessed the Tom Tackle murder in Southampton to a priest. The prison officer made a note of what the appellant had said. He said that he had hit the girl to keep her quiet. He had later taken her by the throat. He had ripped her clothes and taken her oval-shaped wrist watch, which he sold in a public house the next day. He said that he had been questioned by the police in Southampton and had admitted other offences so that he would be taken away from the scene of the murder. The appellant wrote a letter dated 9 December 1980. In it he recorded: ""After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. .... I did the murder, why I don't know. So all I can say is let justice be done ...."" Unsurprisingly the police were informed. On 15 December they went to see him in prison. It emerged that the appellant had admitted the offence to a solicitor. He did not want a solicitor present at this interview. A record was made. It is a very long, detailed account. It refers to the strangulation of the victim after one almighty struggle. He said, ""There was all foam coming from her mouth"". He ended by saying that he had to tell someone. In later questioning on that day he described how the girl had ""sat on the seat with her legs outside, and then as she swung them in, she pulled the door shut"". That coincided with her mother's description of how the deceased would get into her car. The appellant described how afterwards her legs were left in ""a funny position to describe"" after the attack, but he said that he did not think that he had assaulted her sexually. He described a watch and a broken chain. He was asked why he had pointed a finger at the man against whom he had made the earlier allegation. He said, ""To take the heat off me so that you wouldn't ask me questions. It's obvious, isn't it?"" Thereafter, on 19 December 1980 the appellant was brought to Southampton from prison to be taken over the various routes he said he had used during the crucial days. Later that day he identified the place where he had sold the watch, after taking some jewellery from the car. He described how he had thrown away the girl's diary, and in a sketch showed a red brick wall and an area with a broken wall. This appeared to coincide with the place where the victim's handbag and purse were found. On 21 December 1980 the appellant asked to see a prison officer. He then dictated at great speed an account of how he had ""done the murder and must face my punishment"". Again, a considerable mass of detail was provided. He referred to the police taking him to the scene and showing him some photographs. He said, correctly, that the deceased's car was ""N"" registered. He had opened the car with his keys and started it. He moved it a couple of yards and went to sleep. He described the struggle and the fact that her clothing was torn. He said that afterwards he had made his way from the yard and that he had been sick. The officer taking the note thought that in a sudden rush of words the appellant said that he had stabbed the girl in the lower part of her body with something he had found in her car. Two days later the appellant handed two exercise books and six pieces of paper to another police officer. In these accounts he asserted, untruthfully, that he knew his victim who had spurned him. the first account contained less detail, but asserted that he had asked time and time again for someone ""to help me put this statement in my own words .... I would like the truth to be known. So, please, can I have help"". The next exercise book asserts that he ""did the murder"" and that there was nothing he could do himself to bring her ""back to life. What am I to do to punish myself for this appalling crime?"" On Christmas Day he handed another prison officer a written admission, this time that he had killed a man in Bruce House, Covent Garden, London, which, according to his account, the prison department thought was ""a load of shit"". He was taken to the prison hospital and put into an observation ward. Two days later he saw another prison officer and repeated his admission that he had committed a murder of a man in London in Covent Garden, and then added a further admission that he had ""also murdered a homosexual in a flat in North London at the end of '78 or '79"". These confessions were undetailed and lacking in specifics. However, they were confessions to murder. They were investigated. They were false confessions. The murders had not happened. On 29 December 1980 two further letters written by the appellant were found by a prison officer. He asserted that ""since 1964"" he had ""led a very bad path of crime, killing, maiming, all for drugs and drink"". The police returned to see the appellant on 2 January 1981. The appellant saw his solicitor before the interview began, and his solicitor was present throughout. The appellant said that he wanted to make a statement. There were ""more things"" he remembered. There then followed an interview which was contemporaneously recorded and signed by the appellant. His solicitor asked that a note should be made of the fact that he had advised the appellant not to make a statement. The appellant said that he wanted to start at the beginning. He asked the question whether the police had ""the jacket which had slime from her vagina on it and pubic hair -- bits and pieces from down there, and blood, I think?"" Thereafter, a lengthy, detailed statement was produced. After describing the strangulation he said that he had tried to rape his victim. Later he spoke of trying to have sex with her again, that is after he had forced her to have sex with him, when he had ejaculated. He said that he had tried to push a tyre lever inside her vagina. By the end of the incident ""one of her legs seemed to be up on the back parcel shelf and the other one was down behind the driver's seat"". He was then asked about the admissions to the two other murders. He was told that these offences were not known to the police and apparently had not happened. He was asked why he admitted them. He explained his admissions on the basis that he wished to clear things up. He said that he had been told about the death of the victim of the first murder, who had died of a heart attack. He wondered if it was the same man he had ""gone over the cubicle to"". As to the second, he had ""done a homosexual over"", but he had not killed him. He worried in case that was the one he had ""done over"" who had died. Later he described how, after killing the deceased, he was gasping for breath, heaving, trying to be sick, and crying with no tears when a light came on and somebody looked out of the flats above the shop. That was consistent with the evidence of a witness who, after hearing sobbing, turned on her bedroom light before looking out at the scene and observed a man, still sobbing and vomiting or trying to vomit. At the end of this interview, the appellant wrote two further letters to the investigating officers. The first had to do with the possible admissibility of his confessions, and his concern that as a matter of law they might not be admissible. The second expressed his desire to be charged because he felt ""so much remorse"" over the ""whole affair"". He would never forgive himself for killing Teresa. He just wanted to be charged, to plead guilty, and get whatever he was going to get. He continued: ""Nobody in their right mind would hold their hands up to murder as I have done with the thought of a life sentence, but I did because I did it. So can you do what you can to sort things out and get the wheels in motion, as they say."" On 18 February 1981 he was seen again by police officers and asked about a number of items of property. He was asked about a red Ladbroke's pen found near the scene. He claimed that it was his own and that he also had a green pen, which was found with his property. He said he had last seen the red pen the day before the murder. He was also asked about a black comb which was found on the floor behind the driver's seat in the victim's car. The appellant started to look for marks on the comb. He identified it as his comb. He said that it was a prison issue comb with his initials scratched on it. He pointed to some scratches and said they were ""R"" and ""H"". He said that he last saw the comb on the night of the murder but did not know what had happened to it. Later microscopic examination of the comb confirmed that there were scratch marks on it which had been made deliberately, and it was of a type issued by the Home Office for distribution in prisons. Finally, he was asked about a bunch of keys taken from him by the police when he was arrested in Trafalgar Square. One of them was what he described as a ""jiggler"", which could be used to unlock all Ford cars, as well as start them. He said that he had used the jiggler to unlock the victim's car. When tested, the jiggler did indeed work. All this evidence was given at trial. It was a feature of the evidence that the appellant had made repeated false claims to have committed criminal offences. Some of the claims were demonstrably false. They included offences of murder that had never happened. All this was elicited before the jury. Much was made of the fact by his counsel at trial that the appellant was a proved, skilful and pathological liar. All that material was before the jury. So, too, was the fact that the various confessions made by the appellant were not always consistent among themselves. However, the prosecution did not rely on the simple fact of the confessions. The confessions to involvement in the murder were made to a number of different people at a number of different times in a number of different ways. Even making allowances for the demonstrated tendency of the appellant to make things up, there were, among other things, these critical features of the killing which were described by him at different times in his confessions. No information was given publicly about the precise position of the deceased's body in the car. The information released was that the body had been found half naked in the back of the car, but no details as to its exact position were given. Information was also released that the victim's clothing had been torn, but not which items of clothing had been torn, and in particular the fact that one leg of a pair of tights had been torn completely away from the remainder. In one or other of his confessions the appellant appeared to describe these matters. The appellant had also said more than once that foam or froth came from the mouth of the deceased while the strangulation was taking place. Foaming at the nose and mouth would be consistent with a long, slow strangulation, which occurred. That was what the pathologist found. It was not publicised. The appellant said that he had used the deceased's clothing around her neck and twisted it to strangle her. The marks on her neck were consistent with this method of strangulation rather than manual strangulation. That was not public knowledge. It was never disclosed that she was injured in the vaginal area, or that there had been bleeding from the vaginal area and damage to the anal area. It was not disclosed that a neighbour had looked out of the window to see who was responsible for the sobbing on the night of the murder. As to the property of the deceased, the appellant said that he had stolen a watch from her and sold it in the public house the next day. Her watch had indeed been offered for sale in this way. This, too, was not public knowledge. We need not describe any further aspects of the confessions which, as the appellant described them, appeared to confirm his personal knowledge of important features of the crime. At trial it was suggested on his behalf that there were three possibilities. The appellant may have discovered the information or some of it from the media, or the police, or had simply guessed intelligently. As to the media, all the available newspaper and television programmes were available to be studied. They did not reveal what were described at trial as the secret details. As to the police, it was never suggested to any of the officers that they had disclosed any of these secret details to the appellant when they interviewed him, and the appellant never said so in any of his later interviews or in his letters or statements. That left intelligent guesswork, but these were very detailed and accurate pieces of information, whereas, by contrast, the admissions to the murders which he had not committed contained no such details. When the appellant's opportunity to give evidence came, he chose to make what was then permitted, an unsworn statement from the dock about which he could not be cross-examined. He said: ""I would like to tell the members of the jury why I can't go in the witness box is because I am a pathological liar. Secondly, I did not kill Teresa De Simone. Thirdly, every time I have been nicked by the police, which is on many occasions, I have made false confessions to crimes I have not committed, and this is the reason why I am not going into the box."" The effect of this unsworn statement must be addressed head on. It meant that the jury heard no evidence from the appellant, either to explain his movements or whereabouts at the time of the killing, or to explain the reasons why he had chosen to make the confessions he did, or how he had come to know so many of the details relating to the offence which were included in them. The jury retired to consider their verdict shortly before 11am on 5 February 1982. Their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 2.15pm. An application was made for leave to appeal against conviction. A number of points were taken but it is sensible to notice that the case advanced on behalf of the appellant at this stage was directed to what were identified as a number of contentions in relation to the confessions. These were said to be the false confessions of a pathological liar who regularly confessed to crimes he had not committed. The confessions he made were composed out of: (a) what he believed to be the truth from articles in newspapers and reports on television; (b) what he discovered at the police station or was told by the police or prison officers; and (c) intelligent guesswork. It was contended that to add weight to his false confessions he eagerly identified any object which the police led him to believe had been found at the scene of the murder and that, having discovered from the newspapers that a lady's gold watch had been taken from the dead girl and having seen a photograph of a facsimile, he untruthfully claimed that he had sold that watch to a man in whose company he had been at the public house in Winchester on the day after the murder. The problem with these grounds of appeal and the contention generally was that, however forcefully they may have been advanced in argument by counsel, whether earlier before the jury or before the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant had not said any of these things for himself in evidence, or indeed addressed them in his unsworn statement. It is therefore unsurprising that the application for leave to appeal against conviction on these grounds was refused. The remaining grounds were without substance. The appellant himself was either unaware of, or had forgotten that leave to appeal had been refused in May 1983. There is an additional feature to which we must draw attention. We were told this morning by Miss Whitehouse on behalf of the Crown that in 1998 an inquiry was made by solicitors then acting on behalf of the appellant to the Forensic Science Services to discover whether the relevant exhibits associated with the Tom Tackle murder were available. Presumably that request would have been made in order to see whether further testing might then be possible. The inquiry failed. The response from the Forensic Science Services, as we are told today, was that none of the exhibits had been retained. That was plainly wrong. We are told that the matter has been referred to the appropriate forensic regulator. We can say no more about it until those investigations have been completed. We can now take up the story from the affidavit of Mr Julian Young, whose firm has taken on the responsibility for the conduct of this appeal. The appellant was seen by Mr Young's partner, Judy Ramjeet, in late April 2008 in order to take his instructions about a possible appeal. At that time it was extremely difficult for her to take detailed instructions because of the continuing medical and mental health difficulties from which the appellant had been suffering for many years and from which he apparently continues to suffer. Indeed he has been an inmate in a prison hospital wing or psychiatric hospital on numerous occasions since his conviction in 1982. However, the matter was investigated, and gradually what remained of the papers were accumulated. More important, the existence and whereabouts of the exhibits from the original investigation were established and located with the assistance of the Hampshire Constabulary and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is perhaps worth noting in this dismal story that both the prosecution and the police have demonstrated their commitment to the interests of justice by co-operating positively and fully with the solicitors for the appellant to try to ensure that all the available material was produced and examined. None of the original defence papers are in existence. They were destroyed years ago in accordance with ordinary professional practice. An application was then made to the Legal Services Commission to authorise the funding to instruct an expert in the area of DNA analysis on the basis of scientific developments since the trial. Again, the Hampshire Constabulary decided that they would be responsible for funding the re-examination and analysis of the samples against known samples taken from the appellant. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service notified Mr Young of the first results of the examination. However, Mr Young was asked to postpone any steps until the entire process was completed. As soon as the results as a whole became available, by letter dated 30 January 2009 it was confirmed to Mr Young that the semen detected on the remaining vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from the appellant. Within a few days Mr Young signed and lodged grounds of appeal against conviction with this court. Mr Young, like the appellant, was unaware of the earlier dismissal of the application for leave to appeal against conviction. The Registrar of Criminal Appeals and his staff immediately set about the process of bringing on the appeal. After searching through the records for 1983 (that is before computerisation) they discovered some old papers relating to the unsuccessful application for leave to appeal. Accordingly they suggested to Mr Young that, in accordance with the statutory provisions, the case should be referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. This was done. The Commission received a letter dated 26 February 2009 from the Special Crime Division of the Crown Prosecution Service which indicated that if the case were to be referred to the Court of Appeal as a result of the new DNA evidence, the Crown would not oppose the appeal. Without conducting its own analysis of the relevant facts or law, but basing itself on the new DNA evidence and the letter from the Crown Prosecution Service, the Commission rightly decided to refer the conviction immediately to the Court. The reference was dated 4 March 2009, and was listed at an early stage. Again, quite rightly, Mr Young did not seek bail for the appellant pending the hearing of the appeal. Questions about the appellant's mental health needed to be considered, and the arrangements for his accommodation if the appeal were successful had necessarily to be put in place. We are grateful to Mr Young and those who have assisted him for their considerable efforts on behalf of the appellant, and to Miss Whitehouse and the Crown Prosecution Service and Hampshire Constabulary for co-operating as they have and examining the case with the calm dispassion which, notwithstanding the horrendous circumstances in which this young woman met her death, it demanded. That concludes our summary of the essential facts which led to this unsafe conviction and the circumstances in which it came to be identified. It can now be rectified. The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions. Perhaps the most important is that we do not know who raped and killed the dead girl. We can but hope for the sake of the appellant and the family of the murdered girl that her killer may yet be identified and brought to justice. But for now all we can do is to quash the conviction. It is accordingly quashed. The appellant will be discharged. There will be no new trial. This judgment will be posted on the judicial website as soon as possible. ______________________________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/490.html","Hodgson, R. v [2009] EWCA Crim 490 (18 March 2009) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 490 Case No. 2009/01092/C5 B e f o r e : THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND AND WALES (Lord Judge) MR JUSTICE IRWIN and MR JUSTICE WYN WILLIAMS ____________________ R E G I N A - v - ROBERT GRAHAM HODGSON (Also known as Sean Hodgson) ____________________ ) 190 Fleet Street, London EC4 Telephone 020-7421 4040 ( to the Court) ____________________ Mr J Young appeared on behalf of the Appellant Miss S Whitehouse appeared on behalf of the Crown ____________________ ____________________ THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: On 5 December 1979 in Southampton, a young woman, Teresa De Simone, was murdered. She suffered a terrible death. She was slowly strangled to death with her own clothing and just before or just after she died she was raped. Her lifeless body was found on the following morning in her car which was parked in the back yard of the Tom Tackle public house. On 5 February 1982, at Winchester Crown Court, before Sheldon J and a jury, the appellant was convicted of this murder. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life. Today, 27 years later, his conviction will be quashed. It is not safe. We must face reality. The first inescapable and appalling consequence is that the appellant has been in custody for 27 years on the basis of an unsafe conviction. The second highly distressing consequence is that some very old wounds will have been re-opened for the family of the dead girl, and her mother in particular. The third consequence is that there will be understandable public concern as to how this has come about, which means that the judgment of the court should set out a full account of the extraordinary circumstances of the case. In the broad public interest, therefore, we must endeavour to set out the facts as they are currently known to us, in order for the community at large to understand how this conviction came about, why it must be quashed, and how it was that these disturbing events took place. We should however emphasise at the outset that, unlike many other miscarriages of justice, this conviction is not being quashed because some unacceptable feature of police misconduct during the course of the investigation has now emerged, or that any witness who gave evidence at trial was untruthful or mistaken, or even that anything done by anyone at the trial, seen in the light of the evidence as it then stood, is open to criticism. The conviction will be quashed for the simple reason that advances in the science of DNA, long after the end of the trial, have proved a fact which, if it had been known at the time, would, notwithstanding the remaining evidence in the case, have resulted in a quite different investigation and a completely different trial. The point, dealt with very shortly for the moment, is that swabs taken from the dead girl at about 11am on the morning of 5 December 1979 have been re-examined. There are sufficient remnants of sperm on them for proper DNA analysis. The conclusion is that the sperm on the swabs did not come from the appellant. Whoever it was who raped the dead girl, on these findings it was not and cannot have been the appellant. The Crown's case at trial was that the man who raped the dead girl was also responsible for killing her. The new DNA evidence has therefore demolished the case for the prosecution. We must set out the facts in more detail. The deceased was working in the evening of 4 December 1979 at the Tom Tackle public house. It was a two night a week part-time job, to supplement her full-time employment as a clerk. She finished work at just after 11pm and, together with a female friend, went to a night club. They used the friend's car. She left her own Ford Escort in the car park at the Tom Tackle. At the club the two young women were together all the time. The deceased consumed soft drinks. After spending time at the club, they returned to the car park at about 1am on 5 December. After dropping the deceased off, her colleague then went home. At about that time, and shortly afterwards, a number of witnesses heard screaming and the banging of car doors. At about the same time, another witness saw a man walking near the scene of the murder who appeared to be vomiting near to some railings. The Crown's case was that the appellant, under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep on the back seat. When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto the back seat and brushed against the appellant. He seized her by the back of her jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other. Thereafter he made away from the scene after taking various items from the deceased. In the morning of 5 December the landlord of the Tom Tackle was expecting a delivery, and it became necessary for him to try to move the deceased's car. He discovered the deceased and telephoned the police. Officers arrived at the scene, followed by the pathologist at about 11.45am. The pathologist described the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting against the back of the seat, and the left thigh running along the edge of the seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well. Six swabs were collected at the scene: a low and high vaginal swab, two anal swabs, a mouth swab and a control swab. The pathologist concluded that the cause of death was strangulation. However, a number of specific features of his findings are relevant to the issues which arise in this case. The air passages of the deceased were congested and contained abundant white frothy mucous. His evidence was that foam coming from the mouth of a victim of strangulation was not a feature of every strangulation, or even of most strangulations. It was a feature only of the long, slow strangulation from which this deceased had died. There were a series of multiple, roughly horizontal, linear, bruised abrasions on the front of the neck, approximately ten separate marks in all, and the pattern of the abrasions matched the description of the chain which the deceased had been said to be wearing that evening. There was no finger-mark bruising on the deceased of the sort which is sometimes associated with manual strangulations. The abrasions were consistent with the clothing having been gripped and twisted against the neck. In addition, there was damage to her genitalia: bruising at the back of the left outer lip of the vagina and a half-inch split on the posterior wall. The anus was swollen and the lower margins intensely congested. The buttocks were stained with blood and dirt. Semen was present in the vagina, in sufficient concentration to indicate that it had been present no more than three to four hours before death. No one suggested that the semen could have come from anyone other than the rapist. The vaginal swabs were tested and found to contain semen. The blood in the semen matched the blood group of the appellant, group A. The deceased belonged to blood group B. Grouping tests performed on the high and low vaginal swabs gave reactions for blood groups AB. This result could have been due to the secretions from the deceased with semen from a man with blood groups A or AB. In addition, a blood stain recovered from a Jay cloth found on the front seat of the car was also blood group A. However, as roughly 30% of the population belong to that blood group, the blood grouping did not prove that the appellant was the source of the blood, although it was consistent with his group and did not exclude him. A search of the car produced a black comb from the rear offside well. The victim's handbag and other belongings were found in various places in the locality. Her car keys and jewellery, which included a watch, rings, and a gold chain with a crucifix, could not be found. Jewellery of a similar design was later depicted in newspaper articles. The appellant was 28 years old. He had numerous previous convictions for offences of dishonesty and deception, as well as many related to offences involving motor vehicles. There was one conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse and another for being in possession of an offensive weapon. There were however no convictions for offences of violence. There is no doubt that even at that stage he was a disturbed personality, with a history of significant self-harming. We now know, and would admit in evidence, that he attended a clinic in 1978 after several incidents of overdosing. He was assessed as having ""a severe personality disorder"" and he was a ""compulsive liar"". He went to Southampton on 4 December, the day of the murder, and booked into a hostel. He was later to say that he had visited the area of the Tom Tackle public house that evening. On 6 December he was arrested for an offence of theft from a motor vehicle. He was found in possession of property stolen from a car. On 7 December he said that he wanted to give some information about the Tom Tackle murder, which had naturally excited a good deal of media interest in the area. He made an allegation against an individual purporting to indicate that that individual appeared to have been involved in the offence. This man, however, was blood group O, and so he was eliminated from inquiries. On 9 December 1979 the appellant was charged with offences of theft and remanded in custody. He was interviewed by detectives on several occasions in relation to this murder, but he was not seen as a suspect at that time. However, because of his blood group, and in view of his allegations, police inquiries were made into his whereabouts on the night of the murder. His movements at the time of the killing could not be verified or corroborated. On 16 May 1980 the appellant made a further statement about the man against whom he had made the earlier allegations. On the same day he pleaded guilty at Southampton to theft. Sentence was deferred. He was granted conditional bail. He was arrested in London on 4 June 1980 and charged with other offences. Some keys were found on him at this time. On 14 July 1980 he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. On this occasion he admitted a large number of relatively minor offences. He could not have committed all of them. Some had occurred while he was in custody. By now there had been a huge amount of coverage of the murder both in the local press and on television and radio news. The coverage included details, but not all the relevant evidential features, of the murder and the rape, the theft of property from the deceased, and included a picture of an oval-shaped watch. Confessions The appellant's confessions were crucial to his conviction. The Crown did not rely on the confessions as such. They focused on the detail provided in the confessions which, on the Crown's case, could only have been known to the man who was responsible for the crime. They relied on other matters as supportive of the confessions, such as the findings consistent with the appellant's blood group, and his undoubted presence in the locality at the relevant time. It is perhaps worth emphasising that it was never suggested at any stage in the trial, or indeed in any material which we have seen, either that any one of the individuals who reported that the appellant had made a confession to him was lying or mistaken about the fact and terms of the confession, nor that anyone to whom he had made a confession, including in particular the police, had behaved improperly by bullying or pressurising him in any way at all. In other words, on the evidence before the jury it was not disputed that everything that he was reported to have said had been said by him and that what he had said was voluntary. Obviously, so far as his own written admissions are concerned, he wrote them and they too were voluntary. The appellant was not linked to this murder until he confessed to it on 11 December 1980 when he asked to see a priest. In this first confession the appellant said that he was having nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed kept coming back to him. The killing, he said, had happened in Southampton about twelve months earlier. He told the priest that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death. The next day, after seeing a solicitor, the appellant told a prison officer that he had confessed the Tom Tackle murder in Southampton to a priest. The prison officer made a note of what the appellant had said. He said that he had hit the girl to keep her quiet. He had later taken her by the throat. He had ripped her clothes and taken her oval-shaped wrist watch, which he sold in a public house the next day. He said that he had been questioned by the police in Southampton and had admitted other offences so that he would be taken away from the scene of the murder. The appellant wrote a letter dated 9 December 1980. In it he recorded: ""After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. .... I did the murder, why I don't know. So all I can say is let justice be done ...."" Unsurprisingly the police were informed. On 15 December they went to see him in prison. It emerged that the appellant had admitted the offence to a solicitor. He did not want a solicitor present at this interview. A record was made. It is a very long, detailed account. It refers to the strangulation of the victim after one almighty struggle. He said, ""There was all foam coming from her mouth"". He ended by saying that he had to tell someone. In later questioning on that day he described how the girl had ""sat on the seat with her legs outside, and then as she swung them in, she pulled the door shut"". That coincided with her mother's description of how the deceased would get into her car. The appellant described how afterwards her legs were left in ""a funny position to describe"" after the attack, but he said that he did not think that he had assaulted her sexually. He described a watch and a broken chain. He was asked why he had pointed a finger at the man against whom he had made the earlier allegation. He said, ""To take the heat off me so that you wouldn't ask me questions. It's obvious, isn't it?"" Thereafter, on 19 December 1980 the appellant was brought to Southampton from prison to be taken over the various routes he said he had used during the crucial days. Later that day he identified the place where he had sold the watch, after taking some jewellery from the car. He described how he had thrown away the girl's diary, and in a sketch showed a red brick wall and an area with a broken wall. This appeared to coincide with the place where the victim's handbag and purse were found. On 21 December 1980 the appellant asked to see a prison officer. He then dictated at great speed an account of how he had ""done the murder and must face my punishment"". Again, a considerable mass of detail was provided. He referred to the police taking him to the scene and showing him some photographs. He said, correctly, that the deceased's car was ""N"" registered. He had opened the car with his keys and started it. He moved it a couple of yards and went to sleep. He described the struggle and the fact that her clothing was torn. He said that afterwards he had made his way from the yard and that he had been sick. The officer taking the note thought that in a sudden rush of words the appellant said that he had stabbed the girl in the lower part of her body with something he had found in her car. Two days later the appellant handed two exercise books and six pieces of paper to another police officer. In these accounts he asserted, untruthfully, that he knew his victim who had spurned him. the first account contained less detail, but asserted that he had asked time and time again for someone ""to help me put this statement in my own words .... I would like the truth to be known. So, please, can I have help"". The next exercise book asserts that he ""did the murder"" and that there was nothing he could do himself to bring her ""back to life. What am I to do to punish myself for this appalling crime?"" On Christmas Day he handed another prison officer a written admission, this time that he had killed a man in Bruce House, Covent Garden, London, which, according to his account, the prison department thought was ""a load of shit"". He was taken to the prison hospital and put into an observation ward. Two days later he saw another prison officer and repeated his admission that he had committed a murder of a man in London in Covent Garden, and then added a further admission that he had ""also murdered a homosexual in a flat in North London at the end of '78 or '79"". These confessions were undetailed and lacking in specifics. However, they were confessions to murder. They were investigated. They were false confessions. The murders had not happened. On 29 December 1980 two further letters written by the appellant were found by a prison officer. He asserted that ""since 1964"" he had ""led a very bad path of crime, killing, maiming, all for drugs and drink"". The police returned to see the appellant on 2 January 1981. The appellant saw his solicitor before the interview began, and his solicitor was present throughout. The appellant said that he wanted to make a statement. There were ""more things"" he remembered. There then followed an interview which was contemporaneously recorded and signed by the appellant. His solicitor asked that a note should be made of the fact that he had advised the appellant not to make a statement. The appellant said that he wanted to start at the beginning. He asked the question whether the police had ""the jacket which had slime from her vagina on it and pubic hair -- bits and pieces from down there, and blood, I think?"" Thereafter, a lengthy, detailed statement was produced. After describing the strangulation he said that he had tried to rape his victim. Later he spoke of trying to have sex with her again, that is after he had forced her to have sex with him, when he had ejaculated. He said that he had tried to push a tyre lever inside her vagina. By the end of the incident ""one of her legs seemed to be up on the back parcel shelf and the other one was down behind the driver's seat"". He was then asked about the admissions to the two other murders. He was told that these offences were not known to the police and apparently had not happened. He was asked why he admitted them. He explained his admissions on the basis that he wished to clear things up. He said that he had been told about the death of the victim of the first murder, who had died of a heart attack. He wondered if it was the same man he had ""gone over the cubicle to"". As to the second, he had ""done a homosexual over"", but he had not killed him. He worried in case that was the one he had ""done over"" who had died. Later he described how, after killing the deceased, he was gasping for breath, heaving, trying to be sick, and crying with no tears when a light came on and somebody looked out of the flats above the shop. That was consistent with the evidence of a witness who, after hearing sobbing, turned on her bedroom light before looking out at the scene and observed a man, still sobbing and vomiting or trying to vomit. At the end of this interview, the appellant wrote two further letters to the investigating officers. The first had to do with the possible admissibility of his confessions, and his concern that as a matter of law they might not be admissible. The second expressed his desire to be charged because he felt ""so much remorse"" over the ""whole affair"". He would never forgive himself for killing Teresa. He just wanted to be charged, to plead guilty, and get whatever he was going to get. He continued: ""Nobody in their right mind would hold their hands up to murder as I have done with the thought of a life sentence, but I did because I did it. So can you do what you can to sort things out and get the wheels in motion, as they say."" On 18 February 1981 he was seen again by police officers and asked about a number of items of property. He was asked about a red Ladbroke's pen found near the scene. He claimed that it was his own and that he also had a green pen, which was found with his property. He said he had last seen the red pen the day before the murder. He was also asked about a black comb which was found on the floor behind the driver's seat in the victim's car. The appellant started to look for marks on the comb. He identified it as his comb. He said that it was a prison issue comb with his initials scratched on it. He pointed to some scratches and said they were ""R"" and ""H"". He said that he last saw the comb on the night of the murder but did not know what had happened to it. Later microscopic examination of the comb confirmed that there were scratch marks on it which had been made deliberately, and it was of a type issued by the Home Office for distribution in prisons. Finally, he was asked about a bunch of keys taken from him by the police when he was arrested in Trafalgar Square. One of them was what he described as a ""jiggler"", which could be used to unlock all Ford cars, as well as start them. He said that he had used the jiggler to unlock the victim's car. When tested, the jiggler did indeed work. All this evidence was given at trial. It was a feature of the evidence that the appellant had made repeated false claims to have committed criminal offences. Some of the claims were demonstrably false. They included offences of murder that had never happened. All this was elicited before the jury. Much was made of the fact by his counsel at trial that the appellant was a proved, skilful and pathological liar. All that material was before the jury. So, too, was the fact that the various confessions made by the appellant were not always consistent among themselves. However, the prosecution did not rely on the simple fact of the confessions. The confessions to involvement in the murder were made to a number of different people at a number of different times in a number of different ways. Even making allowances for the demonstrated tendency of the appellant to make things up, there were, among other things, these critical features of the killing which were described by him at different times in his confessions. No information was given publicly about the precise position of the deceased's body in the car. The information released was that the body had been found half naked in the back of the car, but no details as to its exact position were given. Information was also released that the victim's clothing had been torn, but not which items of clothing had been torn, and in particular the fact that one leg of a pair of tights had been torn completely away from the remainder. In one or other of his confessions the appellant appeared to describe these matters. The appellant had also said more than once that foam or froth came from the mouth of the deceased while the strangulation was taking place. Foaming at the nose and mouth would be consistent with a long, slow strangulation, which occurred. That was what the pathologist found. It was not publicised. The appellant said that he had used the deceased's clothing around her neck and twisted it to strangle her. The marks on her neck were consistent with this method of strangulation rather than manual strangulation. That was not public knowledge. It was never disclosed that she was injured in the vaginal area, or that there had been bleeding from the vaginal area and damage to the anal area. It was not disclosed that a neighbour had looked out of the window to see who was responsible for the sobbing on the night of the murder. As to the property of the deceased, the appellant said that he had stolen a watch from her and sold it in the public house the next day. Her watch had indeed been offered for sale in this way. This, too, was not public knowledge. We need not describe any further aspects of the confessions which, as the appellant described them, appeared to confirm his personal knowledge of important features of the crime. At trial it was suggested on his behalf that there were three possibilities. The appellant may have discovered the information or some of it from the media, or the police, or had simply guessed intelligently. As to the media, all the available newspaper and television programmes were available to be studied. They did not reveal what were described at trial as the secret details. As to the police, it was never suggested to any of the officers that they had disclosed any of these secret details to the appellant when they interviewed him, and the appellant never said so in any of his later interviews or in his letters or statements. That left intelligent guesswork, but these were very detailed and accurate pieces of information, whereas, by contrast, the admissions to the murders which he had not committed contained no such details. When the appellant's opportunity to give evidence came, he chose to make what was then permitted, an unsworn statement from the dock about which he could not be cross-examined. He said: ""I would like to tell the members of the jury why I can't go in the witness box is because I am a pathological liar. Secondly, I did not kill Teresa De Simone. Thirdly, every time I have been nicked by the police, which is on many occasions, I have made false confessions to crimes I have not committed, and this is the reason why I am not going into the box."" The effect of this unsworn statement must be addressed head on. It meant that the jury heard no evidence from the appellant, either to explain his movements or whereabouts at the time of the killing, or to explain the reasons why he had chosen to make the confessions he did, or how he had come to know so many of the details relating to the offence which were included in them. The jury retired to consider their verdict shortly before 11am on 5 February 1982. Their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 2.15pm. An application was made for leave to appeal against conviction. A number of points were taken but it is sensible to notice that the case advanced on behalf of the appellant at this stage was directed to what were identified as a number of contentions in relation to the confessions. These were said to be the false confessions of a pathological liar who regularly confessed to crimes he had not committed. The confessions he made were composed out of: (a) what he believed to be the truth from articles in newspapers and reports on television; (b) what he discovered at the police station or was told by the police or prison officers; and (c) intelligent guesswork. It was contended that to add weight to his false confessions he eagerly identified any object which the police led him to believe had been found at the scene of the murder and that, having discovered from the newspapers that a lady's gold watch had been taken from the dead girl and having seen a photograph of a facsimile, he untruthfully claimed that he had sold that watch to a man in whose company he had been at the public house in Winchester on the day after the murder. The problem with these grounds of appeal and the contention generally was that, however forcefully they may have been advanced in argument by counsel, whether earlier before the jury or before the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant had not said any of these things for himself in evidence, or indeed addressed them in his unsworn statement. It is therefore unsurprising that the application for leave to appeal against conviction on these grounds was refused. The remaining grounds were without substance. The appellant himself was either unaware of, or had forgotten that leave to appeal had been refused in May 1983. There is an additional feature to which we must draw attention. We were told this morning by Miss Whitehouse on behalf of the Crown that in 1998 an inquiry was made by solicitors then acting on behalf of the appellant to the Forensic Science Services to discover whether the relevant exhibits associated with the Tom Tackle murder were available. Presumably that request would have been made in order to see whether further testing might then be possible. The inquiry failed. The response from the Forensic Science Services, as we are told today, was that none of the exhibits had been retained. That was plainly wrong. We are told that the matter has been referred to the appropriate forensic regulator. We can say no more about it until those investigations have been completed. We can now take up the story from the affidavit of Mr Julian Young, whose firm has taken on the responsibility for the conduct of this appeal. The appellant was seen by Mr Young's partner, Judy Ramjeet, in late April 2008 in order to take his instructions about a possible appeal. At that time it was extremely difficult for her to take detailed instructions because of the continuing medical and mental health difficulties from which the appellant had been suffering for many years and from which he apparently continues to suffer. Indeed he has been an inmate in a prison hospital wing or psychiatric hospital on numerous occasions since his conviction in 1982. However, the matter was investigated, and gradually what remained of the papers were accumulated. More important, the existence and whereabouts of the exhibits from the original investigation were established and located with the assistance of the Hampshire Constabulary and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is perhaps worth noting in this dismal story that both the prosecution and the police have demonstrated their commitment to the interests of justice by co-operating positively and fully with the solicitors for the appellant to try to ensure that all the available material was produced and examined. None of the original defence papers are in existence. They were destroyed years ago in accordance with ordinary professional practice. An application was then made to the Legal Services Commission to authorise the funding to instruct an expert in the area of DNA analysis on the basis of scientific developments since the trial. Again, the Hampshire Constabulary decided that they would be responsible for funding the re-examination and analysis of the samples against known samples taken from the appellant. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service notified Mr Young of the first results of the examination. However, Mr Young was asked to postpone any steps until the entire process was completed. As soon as the results as a whole became available, by letter dated 30 January 2009 it was confirmed to Mr Young that the semen detected on the remaining vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from the appellant. Within a few days Mr Young signed and lodged grounds of appeal against conviction with this court. Mr Young, like the appellant, was unaware of the earlier dismissal of the application for leave to appeal against conviction. The Registrar of Criminal Appeals and his staff immediately set about the process of bringing on the appeal. After searching through the records for 1983 (that is before computerisation) they discovered some old papers relating to the unsuccessful application for leave to appeal. Accordingly they suggested to Mr Young that, in accordance with the statutory provisions, the case should be referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. This was done. The Commission received a letter dated 26 February 2009 from the Special Crime Division of the Crown Prosecution Service which indicated that if the case were to be referred to the Court of Appeal as a result of the new DNA evidence, the Crown would not oppose the appeal. Without conducting its own analysis of the relevant facts or law, but basing itself on the new DNA evidence and the letter from the Crown Prosecution Service, the Commission rightly decided to refer the conviction immediately to the Court. The reference was dated 4 March 2009, and was listed at an early stage. Again, quite rightly, Mr Young did not seek bail for the appellant pending the hearing of the appeal. Questions about the appellant's mental health needed to be considered, and the arrangements for his accommodation if the appeal were successful had necessarily to be put in place. We are grateful to Mr Young and those who have assisted him for their considerable efforts on behalf of the appellant, and to Miss Whitehouse and the Crown Prosecution Service and Hampshire Constabulary for co-operating as they have and examining the case with the calm dispassion which, notwithstanding the horrendous circumstances in which this young woman met her death, it demanded. That concludes our summary of the essential facts which led to this unsafe conviction and the circumstances in which it came to be identified. It can now be rectified. The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions. Perhaps the most important is that we do not know who raped and killed the dead girl. We can but hope for the sake of the appellant and the family of the murdered girl that her killer may yet be identified and brought to justice. But for now all we can do is to quash the conviction. It is accordingly quashed. The appellant will be discharged. There will be no new trial. This judgment will be posted on the judicial website as soon as possible. ______________________________"

The two victims were members of a gang known as the ""Wood Green Mob"". The defendants were members of a rival gang called the ""Northumberland Park Killers"". The rivalry had been a violent one, with each gang carrying out attacks on the other and then boasting about them online. In the autumn of 2019, at the Central Criminal Court before HHJ Foster and a jury, five defendants were tried for the murder of Mr Gabbidon-Lynck and the attempted murder of Mr Fraser. Sheareem Cookhorn was convicted of murder, attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 28 years. He has not sought to appeal against conviction or sentence. Ojay Hamilton was convicted of murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article. He was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure for a minimum term of 21 years. He applies for permission to appeal against conviction and appeals against sentence with leave of the single judge (Andrews J, as she then was). Shane Lyons was convicted of the same offences as Hamilton and received the same sentence of detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure with a minimum term of 21 years. He likewise seeks leave to appeal against conviction, though not on the same grounds as Hamilton, and also appeals against sentence with leave of the single judge. Jayden O'Neill-Crichlow was also convicted of the same offences as Hamilton and Lyons and does not seek leave to appeal against conviction. He likewise was sentenced to detention at Her Majesty Pleasure, with a minimum term of 21 years and appeals against sentence with leave of the single judge. Tyrell Graham was convicted of murder and attempted murder. He was sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure for a minimum of 25 years. He does not seek permission to appeal against conviction but renews an application for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge. The case was listed for the two applications for permission to appeal against conviction and the four cases (three appeals and one application) relating to sentence. Difficulties arose with the Cloud Video Platform at a stage when we had heard argument on the conviction applications but before we were able to hear counsel in support of the sentence appeals and application. This therefore is our judgment on the applications for permission to appeal against conviction by Hamilton and Lyons. On the night of 22 February 2019 Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck was stabbed to death in a hair salon in the Wood Green area of London. Moments earlier his associate, Jason Fraser, had been subject to a similar assault during which he sustained eight stab wounds as well as gunshot injuries but which he survived. Graham and Hamilton as well as the co-accused, Cookhorn, all accepted links to the Northumberland Park Killers. Hamilton and Lyons had Instagram accounts that included the initials ""NPK"" in the account names. The two victims were both linked to the Wood Green Mob. Two days after the killing a music video featuring Graham and others was uploaded to YouTube. In this video the rappers referenced an earlier killing and other previous stabbings committed against other members of the Wood Green Mob. In May 2019 O'Neill-Crichlow, along with two others, appeared in another video in which they rapped about gang related activity and the possession of knives and firearms. On the night before the incident O'Neill-Crichlow, Lyons and Hamilton were captured together on CCTV on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham using a Peugeot car which apparently belonged to O'Neill-Crichlow's mother. On Friday 22 February, at around 7.00 pm, O'Neill-Crichlow and Hamilton, together with three other unidentified males, were caught on CCTV cycling towards the same estate. O'Neill-Crichlow could be seen going to the Peugeot car and changing his clothes. The prosecution alleged that the CCTV showed that Lyons was also in their company; he disputed that identification and his presence during the events of that evening. It is apparent from the jury's verdict in the case that they accepted that the man alleged to be Lyons (who was given a code name ""Partridge"" during the trial for ease of reference) was in fact Lyons. About an hour later a group of cyclists rode from the estate towards Wood Green. The group contained Graham, O'Neill-Crichlow, Lyons, Hamilton, Cookhorn and two others. Each member of the group had their face covered. Upon reaching Wood Green they stopped outside a branch of McDonald's and Graham, Hamilton, Lyons and one of the unidentified males who was given the code name ""Buzzard"" entered the restaurant. They walked up to one of the tables at which two young females and a young male were sitting. Graham grabbed the young male by the throat while Buzzard attempted unsuccessfully to take his mobile phone. Fortunately that incident came to an end without violence. Around the same time as that group had been making its way to McDonald's Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck, Jason Fraser and two associates arrived in Wood Green only a short distance away. On spotting the group of four the defendants immediately dropped their bicycles, at least some of them drew weapons and they ran towards the group of four. Cookhorn drew a handgun which he fired. The cartridge casing was later recovered and was consistent with the firearm being a semi-automatic handgun. O'Neill-Crichlow and Lyons both brandished large silver knives. Although the precise number of shots fired from Cookhorn's handgun was not known, witnesses recalled hearing two or three rounds being discharged. One of the discharged rounds went across the pedestrian area and in through the open doors of a shop in which several customers and security guards were present, ultimately striking a display stand but without causing any injuries. As the defendants came into view of another CCTV camera, Graham could be seen with a large black knife in his hand, Lyons was still brandishing his knife, while Hamilton had his right hand inside his clothing; the prosecution alleged that this was indicative of him holding a concealed weapon. The three fleeing males were pursued by the two unidentified males from the defendant's group. Diners in a Nando's restaurant captured part of the events on mobile phone cameras. The defendants appeared to be chasing the fleeing group. Graham, Lyons and Hamilton all ran past the restaurant, the former two with knives in hand and the latter with his hand still inside his clothing. A little later Gabbidon-Lynck and Fraser ran east along Lordship Lane. Fraser was carrying a knife. The defendants and associates group of seven (now all once again on their bicycles) followed about 20 seconds later. Gabbidon-Lynck and Fraser took different routes as they ran back towards a parked car. Fraser became cornered by his pursuers in two groups in what was described as a pincer movement. He was assaulted by at least some members of the group and was stabbed eight times in his shoulder, arms, legs and also sustained a wound to the buttocks from shotgun pellets. The assault on Fraser was interrupted by the arrival of Gabbidon-Lynck who was now driving a Corsa car. He aimed his car for some bicycles belonging to the defendants' group lying on the ground. He drove over the top of Graham's bike rendering it unusable. He now became the target for the group's attack. As he backed the car away one of the identified men chased him and tried to strike the driver's window. Graham paused to look at his damaged bike before running towards the Corsa. A couple of seconds later Cookhorn raised his right arm in the direction of the Corsa, just as he had done when firing his gun previously. O'Neill-Crichlow dropped his bicycle to the ground and ran towards the Corsa. Thirteen seconds later Partridge and Hamilton ran across the road towards the Corsa. O'Neill-Crichlow and Graham came back into view and collected their bicycles. Lyons and Hamilton came back into view with Lyons picking up his bicycles and Hamilton appearing to place something into his trousers, which had possibly been passed to him by Patridge/Lyons. Mr Moloney QC, for Hamilton, has emphasised to us, and we accept, that the CCTV did not show Hamilton holding a knife. The cameras did not capture the fatal attack on Mr Gabbidon-Lynck. As he tried to escape he managed to get his car stuck between parked cars on either side of the road. His car was immediately attacked by members of the group. Across the road from where his car came to a stop was a hairdresser salon called Koffee An' Kreem. There were stylists and customers inside. One of the customers waiting her turn to be served had a baby. There was also an 8-year-old girl and a 4-year-old girl in the salon. These people were witnesses to the car being surrounded by masked figures. One man fired shots at the window of the car before jumping onto the bonnet and smashing the gun down on the windscreen. A second man also jumped onto the bonnet and struck the windscreen with what appeared to be a machete. Mr Gabbidon-Lynck got out of the car, ran to the salon chased by several men who swung their weapons at him. He ran into the salon but was unable to keep the door closed. The attackers gained entry to the shop. Everyone inside began screaming and rushed to the rear of the salon as the deceased cowered in a corner trying to fend off the attack. He was set upon by more than one attacker who stabbed and slashed at him with their knives, eventually turning away leaving him fatally wounded. He died in hospital from his injuries. The attacking group made their way back to the car park on the Broadwater Farm estate where O'Neill-Crichlow had parked the Peugeot and where they appeared to change their clothing. Police arrived on the estate shortly thereafter. The defendants sought to make themselves scarce. Graham was stopped by the police and provided false details. He was searched for weapons and as none were found he was allowed to go, saying to officers as he walked away, ""I hope you lot cut down on knife violence, and all that"". It is right to record that when police searched the Corsa which Mr Gabbidon-Lynck had been driving they recovered a shotgun and ammunition from the boot, a machete and an axe from the front passenger footwell and a knife in the rear door. The defendants were identified by police from the Broadwater Farm CCTV footage. We turn to the applications for leave to appeal against conviction. Hamilton had a previous conviction for possession of a bladed article in June 2017, 20 months before the incident in the present case. He was 14 years old at the time of that previous conviction and 16 at the time of the instant trial. His ground of appeal against conviction is that the judge was wrong to accede to the prosecution application to admit the previous conviction as evidence of misconduct and that its admission was unfairly prejudicial to Hamilton's defence. It is instructive to note the basis of plea which Hamilton sought to tender in a document dated 8 October 2019 to the count of possession of a bladed article in a public place. It reads: ""i. I was in possession of the bladed article for a short period of time. ii. At no time while in possession of the bladed article (or before or afterwards) did I have any intention to use it to do harm to others, or to threaten or cause fear. iii. On 22 February 2019, after hearing a loud bang as a car collided with another, I was in a state of shock. I saw a commotion taking place in a nearby shop and I wanted to get out of the area quickly. As I cycled off, someone stopped me and passed me a bladed article which I put down the waistband of my trousers before I cycled away."" This basis was not acceptable to the prosecution. In his written ruling on various applications relating to evidence Judge Foster said this of the prosecution application to admit the previous conviction: ""The jury will have to consider his [Hamilton's] explanation for the possession of the knife in the light of all the evidence in the case  not just the few seconds of CCTV when any exchange of knives might have taken place. Furthermore his young age at the time of the previous conviction must be considered alongside his guilty plea for knife possession on the night in question. I am satisfied that the previous conviction is properly admissible not just because it is capable of showing a propensity to carry knives but also as rebuttal of how he says he came to be in possession of a knife on 22 February, 2019."" Mr Moloney emphasises that the previous conviction was recorded when the defendant was only 14 and related to very different circumstances. It was, he argued, just a case of a school boy carrying a kitchen knife in his bag. There was no suggestion that it was used to commit any act of violence. The penalty imposed was a referral order. He argued that this was a single incident, nearly 2 years before the index charges, and could not be a sufficient basis to admit the previous conviction as evidencing a propensity to carry a knife. The conviction could not, independently of propensity, rebut the applicant's account of his possession of the knife on the night in question. It was also submitted to us, as it was to the judge, that the legitimate public concern surrounding possession and use of knives in London could lead to unwarranted prejudice on the part of the jury. It was unfair for the conviction to have been admitted when it went to such a fundamental aspect of Hamilton's defence. Mr Moloney accepted that if the jury were satisfied that Hamilton brought a knife to the scene, his defence, as crisply summarised in paragraph iii of the basis of plea, would be in some difficulty. Mr Glasgow contends that whether Hamilton was armed with a knife throughout the attacks on Mr Gabbidon-Lynck and Mr Fraser was an important matter in issue between the prosecution and the defendant, although it was not the fundamental question in the case. The fundamental question was whether the prosecution could satisfy the jury that Hamilton was part of the group who carried out either or both of the attacks, in the sense that he assisted or encouraged those who actually inflicted the wounds on either or both of the victims. The judge's ruling was made in the context of a case where Hamilton accepted that he was linked to the Northumberland Park Killers who had a bloody rivalry with the Wood Green Mob, where Hamilton had set off by bicycle that evening in the company of a group that contained the other defendants in the case, and where the CCTV footage showed that all of his co-defendants had been armed either with a firearm (in the case of Cookhorn) or with large knives. Hamilton was standing next to his friends when they were holding their knives and, at one point on the CCTV as we have noted, his arm can be seen going to the waistband of his trousers which the prosecution say suggested he too had a knife; he had followed some of his co-defendants down an alleyway that led to a gate where Fraser was attacked; he then dismounted from his cycle and ran with it towards the salon where Mr Gabbidon-Lynck was being stabbed to death; finally, on returning to the car park he and the others changed out of their clothes and evaded detection by the police before taking a minicab home. Mr Moloney referred us to the very well-known passage in the judgment of this court delivered by the then Vice-President (Rose LJ) in Hanson [2005] 1 WLR 3169 at paragraph 9: ""There is no minimum number of events necessary to demonstrate such a propensity. The fewer the number of convictions the weaker is likely to be the evidence of propensity. A single previous conviction for an offence of the same description or category will often not show propensity. But it may do so where, for example, it shows a tendency to unusual behaviour or where its circumstances demonstrate probative force in relation to the offence charged (compare DPP v P [1991] 2 AC 447 at 460E to 461A). Child sexual abuse or fire setting are comparatively clear examples of such unusual behaviour but we attempt no exhaustive list. Circumstances demonstrating probative force are not confined to those sharing striking similarity. So, a single conviction for shoplifting, will not, without more, be admissible to show propensity to steal. But if the modus operandi has significant features shared by the offence charged it may show propensity."" The possession of a bladed article in a public place is, sadly, not unusual behaviour. But the circumstances of this previous conviction, in our view, demonstrate probative force in relation to the offence charged. It was an important aspect of Hamilton's defence that while he had no real choice but to admit having been in possession of a knife on the night in question, since it was visible on CCTV at the very end of the events which were the subject of the charges, it was, according to him, handed to him at a very late stage, possibly after the fatal stabbing of Mr Gabbidon-Lynck, rather than having been brought by him to the scene. The fact of the previous conviction for the identical offence in law only 20 months earlier went directly to this important matter in issue between him and the prosecution and did so irrespective of the details of the facts underlying the previous conviction, such as the precise size and type of the bladed article which he had in his possession on that occasion. It was for the jury to decide what weight to attach to the previous conviction. We see no reason why it should have been kept secret from them. Accordingly, we refuse Hamilton's renewed application for permission to appeal against conviction. Lyons applies for permission to appeal against conviction on an entirely different ground. The judge held a ground rules hearing at which he directed that cross-examination should on the whole not be repeated as between co-defendants and the prosecution, although that could be reviewed once a defendant had given evidence-in-chief. Questions should be asked in a logical order without jumping around from topic to topic. Questioning should be slowed down to give the witness ample time to respond. Questions should be as simple as possible, avoid legal jargon, use age appropriate words and should not be tagged and there should be regular breaks with sessions lasting no longer than 1 hour. No complaint is made on behalf of Lyons about these directions, nor could it be. The argument is rather than the directions were not adhered to, or not sufficiently adhered to, by Mr Glasgow QC for the prosecution during his cross-examination of Lyons. Mr Aldeiri, who has appeared in this Court, submits, adopting the written submissions of Mr John Cooper QC who led the defence of Lyons at trial, that the appellant was exhausted following intense cross-examination that was beyond the scope of the ground rules. It is submitted that the judge's control of that situation was inadequate with him merely commenting that it was simply Mr Glasgow's style of advocacy. We have read the transcript of the cross-examination of Mr Lyons. There were four sessions timed as follows: from 11.35 to 12.11; from 12.37 to 13.02; from 14.11 to 14.59 and 15.38 to 16.15. In our view, Mr Glasgow conducted the cross-examination with proper courtesy and care. In the first session the most pointed question he asks Lyons is: ""Why Ojay Hamilton should lie about you being there""? In the second session there is a point at which Mr Glasgow is questioning the defendant about whether he is the person shown in particular CCTV footage. There is an objection raised by Mr Cooper and when the objection is repeated a little later the judge tells Mr Glasgow to move on to another topic, which he does. Later, just before the lunch break, Mr Cooper accuses Mr Glasgow of hectoring the witness but, in our opinion, the transcript does not support that proposition. In the third session at page Y189 the defendant says that he got a minicab from his home that evening. Mr Glasgow asks: ""If there is no record of a cab going to your address on that evening does that mean you are lying?"" Mr Cooper objects to the question. Mr Glasgow then puts it to the witness in a slightly different form: ""If you are telling the truth and they keep their records there will be a record?"" At this point Mr Cooper asks for the jury to be sent out. The transcript unhelpfully does not record the discussion in the absence of the jury but what it does show is that nine minutes later they are brought back into court and from that point on there is no reference by Mr Glasgow to lying. Although the days of counsel haranguing witnesses with repeated accusations that they are lying should be over, we do not think that the questioning on this (or any other) point was at all inappropriate even when put to a 16-year-old witness. It was perfectly fair to put to the defendant that, if what he was saying about having got a minicab from home to the scene was true, that fact should be confirmed by the records which all minicab companies keep. In the final session at page Y207 of the transcript it seems that someone's mobile phone goes off. Mr Cooper asks Mr Glasgow to stop questioning and he does so with an apology. Then at page Y211 Mr Cooper asks Mr Glasgow to slow down the questioning a bit and the judge agrees. Mr Glasgow asks the witness whether he needs a break, the witness says ""no"". At page Y228 Mr Cooper, not the witness, says that the witness is looking tired, Mr Glasgow offers to break off until Monday, the defendant says, ""No, carry on"". The judge tell Mr Glasgow to try to finish the topic in 5 minutes, which he does, and the court rises for the day. We consider that this questioning comes nowhere near being oppressive or unfair. Lyons' renewed application for permission to appeal against conviction is therefore refused. Thursday 11 March 2021: LORD JUSTICE BEAN: We are now announcing our decision on sentence in this case, in which we gave judgment on Tuesday refusing two applications for permission to appeal against conviction. We begin by dealing with two technical points raised by the ever-vigilant staff of the Criminal Appeal Office. The first is that the judge imposed concurrent sentences of detention for 8 years on each of these defendants on the charge of wounding Jason Fraser with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The judge did not expressly refer to section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, but that was plainly what he had in mind. The court record should be amended to reflect the fact that these concurrent sentences were imposed pursuant to that provision. The second technical point is that the judge erred in imposing concurrent sentences on the charge of possession of a bladed article of 15 months on Hamilton and 12 months on O'Neill-Crichlow and Lyons. These were unlawful because section 91 of the 2000 Act is not available for this offence. A concurrent detention and training order would plainly have been inappropriate. We quash the three sentences in respect of the bladed article charges and substitute an order that there will be no separate penalty. Neither of these technical points alters by so much as a day the time which any of the defendants will spend in custody, but it is right to put the record straight. We turn to matters of substance. It is important to bear in mind in a case of this kind where a defendant has been convicted of murder and also of a separate serious offence, that the correct practice is to fix a minimum term of imprisonment or detention for the murder which is the appropriate penalty for the offences as a whole (see section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003) and then to impose concurrent sentences for the other offence or offences. This was the course followed by the judge in the present case and no complaint is or could be made of it. It is common ground that the statutory starting point for the murder alone was 12 years in the case of each of these appellants and applicant, but that a very significant increase from that figure was inevitable. There were numerous aggravating features of these offences. These were aptly summarised by the judge in his sentencing remarks at page 7C-G: ""The most serious extra aggravating feature is the gang-related background to this case. The tragedy of that background is as futile as it is evil. The pointless gang rivalry has resulted in the loss of one young man's life, the serious injury to another and five young men who will spend at the very least the best years of their lives in custody. You were all linked to one gang, the North London Park Killers and this was a planned and premeditated mission to find and attack members of a rival gang. The message must be understood that young people who involve themselves in this sort of conduct can expect little mercy from the Courts. That is why I have lifted all reporting restrictions not withstanding your ages so that other young people and their families can know of the consequences of such conduct. Your actions terrified innocent members of the public going about their business on a Friday evening, first of all in the Hollywood Green area of Wood Green and then in and around the hair salon on Temple Terrace. The murder was witnessed by a four year old child and the owner of the salon was so traumatised by what she saw that she was too ill to give live evidence at your trial, some nine months later. The victim personal statements from a grieving family makes sad reading."" The judge began by considering the appropriate starting point in sentencing Cookhorn. He said: ""By paragraph 5.1 of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 for an offender who commits murder when over 18 and where the seriousness of the offence or the combination of the offence and one-on-one offences associated with it is particularly high the starting point is a minimum term of 30 years. Paragraph 5.2 provides that a murder involved in the use of a firearm will normally fall within this category. I am satisfied that for you, Sheareem Cookhorn, that this is the appropriate starting point and is the factual basis on which I set the minimum term for the remainder of you. "" It is submitted that when the judge said ""and is the factual basis on which I set the minimum term for the remainder of you"" he meant that he was holding that the minimum term that would have been appropriate in each of the cases before us (that is to say all the defendants except Cookhorn) would have been 30 years. It is submitted that this case was not, at least as regards the defendants other than Cookhorn, a murder involving the use of a firearm. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether, as a matter of law, a murder in which a firearm is brought to the scene and fired but does not cause injury and in which the victim is then stabbed to death is ""a murder involving the use of a firearm"". Even if were not, a notional starting point of a minimum term of 30 years for all of these defendants, if they had been over 18 years of age, would have been justified. As the judge noted, paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 21 provides that, if the seriousness of the offence or the combination of the offence of murder and one or more offences associated with it is particularly high (not exceptionally high as it has to be for a whole life order), the appropriate starting point is 30 years. The starting point for murder by an adult, with a weapon taken to the scene with the intent to use it to commit an offence or to have it available for such use, is 25 years by virtue of paragraph 5A of Schedule 21. Here there was a murder by stabbing, using one or more knives taken to the scene, and in addition (a) the discharge of a firearm by Cookhorn and (b) the ferocious attack on Jason Fraser, who was lucky to escape with his life. Had the defendants been adults, therefore, a statutory starting point of 30 years would certainly have been justified in the case of Graham and possibly also in the case of the other defendants. On behalf of Graham, who was only two months short of his 18th birthday at the time of the murder, it is submitted that a minimum term of 25 years in his case was excessive because (a) the judge was wrong to conclude that the applicant was a principal offender in relation to the murder, (b) the judge was wrong to find that there was sufficient evidence of significant premeditation or planning as an aggravating factor and (c) he failed to take sufficient account of the applicant's age and level of maturity at the time of the offending. In refusing permission to appeal on the papers the single judge said: ""Your pursuit of the victim into the hairdressers and repeated stabbing of him in front of terrified customers including a 4 year old girl, was enough to mark this murder out as justifying a significant uplift from the starting point of 12 years by reason of your age. Given that you continued to associate with Cookhorn after he first discharged the gun the judge was also entitled to take into account when sentencing you your knowledge of his having a gun and his willingness to use it without regard to the danger posed to innocent passers-by. Moreover, having tried you and all your co-defendants, the judge was best placed to evaluate your role in the offences and your culpability for it and he was satisfied that you were one of the ringleaders and one of the two responsible for inflicting the violence on the victims. Despite your age I do not consider it is reasonably arguable that either the minimum tariff of 25 years for the murder or the 20-year sentence for the attempted murder in your case was manifestly excessive."" We agree, and the renewed application by Graham is refused. We turn to the other three defendants, each of whom appeals by leave of the single judge. In each case counsel can point to the judge's express findings in his sentencing remarks that they did not have an intention to kill Mr Gabbidon-Lynck (nor of course Mr Fraser, given that they were acquitted of attempted murder); that each of them was a secondary party to both offences; and to the fact that each of them was aged only 16 at the time of the offences. The additional points made in the individual cases are as follows. O'Neill-Crichlow was not involved in the McDonald's incident. It is argued that even after that his role was less than that of Hamilton or Lyons. But in the absence of any finding to that effect by the sentencing judge, who had heard all the evidence in the case, we are not prepared to make a distinction on those grounds. It must also be said against him that the gang made use of his mother's car, not, it seems, as a prospective getaway vehicle but as a repository for clothing so that they could change clothes before and after the violent encounter in the hope of avoiding detection. O'Neill-Crichlow had no previous convictions, but one previous reprimand for possession of a bladed article. Hamilton was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had an IQ of only 80. Although the judge had seen him give evidence, it may be that to say that his maturity was only ""slightly less than his biological age"" was understating this point a little. On the other hand, his previous conviction for possession of a bladed article was a point against him. Lyons was the youngest defendant, being 4 months younger than Hamilton. A pre-sentence report expressed the opinion that he was immature and easily led. He had no previous convictions at all, although the judge took a poor view of the fact that a knife was found in his bedroom carefully wrapped in a sock. We will follow the judge's lead in this respect. We do not consider there is any basis for distinguishing between these three defendants. An important recent decision to which we were referred was Davies [2020] EWCA Crim 921 , delivered on 29 April 2020 (that is to say after the judge passed sentence in the present case). The judgment of this court was delivered by Lord Burnett of Maldon CJ. Davies had been convicted of a murder committed when he was 16-year-old 2 months old. There were many similarities between the Davies case and the present one. A number of members of one gang set upon a member of another gang, and between them stabbed him fifteen times. The victim died shortly afterwards. The court set out the factual conclusions of the sentencing judge at paragraph 10: ""(i) The appellant had been responsible for corralling the group which proceeded to kill the deceased. Despite his age, the appellant was influential in the gang. (ii) The attack was a premeditated, targeted revenge attack. (iii) The appellant  and indeed the others convicted of murder  had an intention to kill the deceased. (iv) The appellant and [his co-accused] Yenge took the two knives used in the attack to the scene, but all knew that knives were there and to be used. (v) Overall, the appellant had a prominent, leading role in what occurred. (vi) The killing was the result of a long-standing hostility between the gangs. (vii) All the co-accused had taken care to turn off their telephones to avoid the possibility of their movements being traced. After the attack, they not only disposed of their weapons, but also washed their bodies and clothes in an attempt to eliminate forensic traces."" The Lord Chief Justice said at paragraph 22: ""The aggravating features identified by the judge in his sentencing remarks are unimpeachable, but we find ourselves in respectful disagreement with the judge's conclusion that, despite the appellant's youth and background, the starting point should be as high as 21 years. The appellant was a good deal younger than the others. That is itself a factor which carries significant weight. Moreover, a striking feature of this case is the appellant's circumstances, which we have summarised. They led him to be a drug user at 11, an addict by 13, and by the same age a professional drug dealer. By then he had been swept up into gang violence. Violence had been a constant background of his life from a very early age."" The minimum term of 21 years imposed on Davies was reduced by this Court to one of 16 years. No two cases are identical, and of course Davies was only being sentenced for a single murder. On the other hand, unlike the three appellants whose cases we are now considering, he was the principal offender and leader of the group which attacked the victim. The decision in Davies , which was not available to Judge Foster, does suggest to us that if the present case had involved the single murder alone, the appropriate minimum terms for these three appellants would have been no higher than 16 years and possibly a little less. Putting these factors together, we have come to the conclusion that the minimum terms of 21 years did not make adequate allowance for the youth and immaturity of these three defendants. We will in each case quash the minimum term of 21 years and substitute a term of 19 years. Time spent in custody prior to sentencing will count towards the minimum term in the usual way. The result is that the earliest time when these three appellants will be eligible for release will be in 2038, by which time they will be 35 years old. Even then, each of them will only be released if the Parole Board is satisfied that it is safe to do so. These remain severe sentences for defendants who were aged only 16 when the offences were committed, but they are appropriate ones in such a serious case.

The two victims were members of a gang known as the ""Wood Green Mob"". The defendants were members of a rival gang called the ""Northumberland Park Killers"". The rivalry had been a violent one, with each gang carrying out attacks on the other and then boasting about them online. In the autumn of 2019, at the Central Criminal Court before HHJ Foster and a jury, five defendants were tried for the murder of Mr Gabbidon-Lynck and the attempted murder of Mr Fraser. Sheareem Cookhorn was convicted of murder, attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 28 years. He has not sought to appeal against conviction or sentence. Ojay Hamilton was convicted of murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article. He was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure for a minimum term of 21 years. He applies for permission to appeal against conviction and appeals against sentence with leave of the single judge (Andrews J, as she then was). Shane Lyons was convicted of the same offences as Hamilton and received the same sentence of detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure with a minimum term of 21 years. He likewise seeks leave to appeal against conviction, though not on the same grounds as Hamilton, and also appeals against sentence with leave of the single judge. Jayden O'Neill-Crichlow was also convicted of the same offences as Hamilton and Lyons and does not seek leave to appeal against conviction. He likewise was sentenced to detention at Her Majesty Pleasure, with a minimum term of 21 years and appeals against sentence with leave of the single judge. Tyrell Graham was convicted of murder and attempted murder. He was sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure for a minimum of 25 years. He does not seek permission to appeal against conviction but renews an application for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge. The case was listed for the two applications for permission to appeal against conviction and the four cases (three appeals and one application) relating to sentence. Difficulties arose with the Cloud Video Platform at a stage when we had heard argument on the conviction applications but before we were able to hear counsel in support of the sentence appeals and application. This therefore is our judgment on the applications for permission to appeal against conviction by Hamilton and Lyons. On the night of 22 February 2019 Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck was stabbed to death in a hair salon in the Wood Green area of London. Moments earlier his associate, Jason Fraser, had been subject to a similar assault during which he sustained eight stab wounds as well as gunshot injuries but which he survived. Graham and Hamilton as well as the co-accused, Cookhorn, all accepted links to the Northumberland Park Killers. Hamilton and Lyons had Instagram accounts that included the initials ""NPK"" in the account names. The two victims were both linked to the Wood Green Mob. Two days after the killing a music video featuring Graham and others was uploaded to YouTube. In this video the rappers referenced an earlier killing and other previous stabbings committed against other members of the Wood Green Mob. In May 2019 O'Neill-Crichlow, along with two others, appeared in another video in which they rapped about gang related activity and the possession of knives and firearms. On the night before the incident O'Neill-Crichlow, Lyons and Hamilton were captured together on CCTV on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham using a Peugeot car which apparently belonged to O'Neill-Crichlow's mother. On Friday 22 February, at around 7.00 pm, O'Neill-Crichlow and Hamilton, together with three other unidentified males, were caught on CCTV cycling towards the same estate. O'Neill-Crichlow could be seen going to the Peugeot car and changing his clothes. The prosecution alleged that the CCTV showed that Lyons was also in their company; he disputed that identification and his presence during the events of that evening. It is apparent from the jury's verdict in the case that they accepted that the man alleged to be Lyons (who was given a code name ""Partridge"" during the trial for ease of reference) was in fact Lyons. About an hour later a group of cyclists rode from the estate towards Wood Green. The group contained Graham, O'Neill-Crichlow, Lyons, Hamilton, Cookhorn and two others. Each member of the group had their face covered. Upon reaching Wood Green they stopped outside a branch of McDonald's and Graham, Hamilton, Lyons and one of the unidentified males who was given the code name ""Buzzard"" entered the restaurant. They walked up to one of the tables at which two young females and a young male were sitting. Graham grabbed the young male by the throat while Buzzard attempted unsuccessfully to take his mobile phone. Fortunately that incident came to an end without violence. Around the same time as that group had been making its way to McDonald's Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck, Jason Fraser and two associates arrived in Wood Green only a short distance away. On spotting the group of four the defendants immediately dropped their bicycles, at least some of them drew weapons and they ran towards the group of four. Cookhorn drew a handgun which he fired. The cartridge casing was later recovered and was consistent with the firearm being a semi-automatic handgun. O'Neill-Crichlow and Lyons both brandished large silver knives. Although the precise number of shots fired from Cookhorn's handgun was not known, witnesses recalled hearing two or three rounds being discharged. One of the discharged rounds went across the pedestrian area and in through the open doors of a shop in which several customers and security guards were present, ultimately striking a display stand but without causing any injuries. As the defendants came into view of another CCTV camera, Graham could be seen with a large black knife in his hand, Lyons was still brandishing his knife, while Hamilton had his right hand inside his clothing; the prosecution alleged that this was indicative of him holding a concealed weapon. The three fleeing males were pursued by the two unidentified males from the defendant's group. Diners in a Nando's restaurant captured part of the events on mobile phone cameras. The defendants appeared to be chasing the fleeing group. Graham, Lyons and Hamilton all ran past the restaurant, the former two with knives in hand and the latter with his hand still inside his clothing. A little later Gabbidon-Lynck and Fraser ran east along Lordship Lane. Fraser was carrying a knife. The defendants and associates group of seven (now all once again on their bicycles) followed about 20 seconds later. Gabbidon-Lynck and Fraser took different routes as they ran back towards a parked car. Fraser became cornered by his pursuers in two groups in what was described as a pincer movement. He was assaulted by at least some members of the group and was stabbed eight times in his shoulder, arms, legs and also sustained a wound to the buttocks from shotgun pellets. The assault on Fraser was interrupted by the arrival of Gabbidon-Lynck who was now driving a Corsa car. He aimed his car for some bicycles belonging to the defendants' group lying on the ground. He drove over the top of Graham's bike rendering it unusable. He now became the target for the group's attack. As he backed the car away one of the identified men chased him and tried to strike the driver's window. Graham paused to look at his damaged bike before running towards the Corsa. A couple of seconds later Cookhorn raised his right arm in the direction of the Corsa, just as he had done when firing his gun previously. O'Neill-Crichlow dropped his bicycle to the ground and ran towards the Corsa. Thirteen seconds later Partridge and Hamilton ran across the road towards the Corsa. O'Neill-Crichlow and Graham came back into view and collected their bicycles. Lyons and Hamilton came back into view with Lyons picking up his bicycles and Hamilton appearing to place something into his trousers, which had possibly been passed to him by Patridge/Lyons. Mr Moloney QC, for Hamilton, has emphasised to us, and we accept, that the CCTV did not show Hamilton holding a knife. The cameras did not capture the fatal attack on Mr Gabbidon-Lynck. As he tried to escape he managed to get his car stuck between parked cars on either side of the road. His car was immediately attacked by members of the group. Across the road from where his car came to a stop was a hairdresser salon called Koffee An' Kreem. There were stylists and customers inside. One of the customers waiting her turn to be served had a baby. There was also an 8-year-old girl and a 4-year-old girl in the salon. These people were witnesses to the car being surrounded by masked figures. One man fired shots at the window of the car before jumping onto the bonnet and smashing the gun down on the windscreen. A second man also jumped onto the bonnet and struck the windscreen with what appeared to be a machete. Mr Gabbidon-Lynck got out of the car, ran to the salon chased by several men who swung their weapons at him. He ran into the salon but was unable to keep the door closed. The attackers gained entry to the shop. Everyone inside began screaming and rushed to the rear of the salon as the deceased cowered in a corner trying to fend off the attack. He was set upon by more than one attacker who stabbed and slashed at him with their knives, eventually turning away leaving him fatally wounded. He died in hospital from his injuries. The attacking group made their way back to the car park on the Broadwater Farm estate where O'Neill-Crichlow had parked the Peugeot and where they appeared to change their clothing. Police arrived on the estate shortly thereafter. The defendants sought to make themselves scarce. Graham was stopped by the police and provided false details. He was searched for weapons and as none were found he was allowed to go, saying to officers as he walked away, ""I hope you lot cut down on knife violence, and all that"". It is right to record that when police searched the Corsa which Mr Gabbidon-Lynck had been driving they recovered a shotgun and ammunition from the boot, a machete and an axe from the front passenger footwell and a knife in the rear door. The defendants were identified by police from the Broadwater Farm CCTV footage. We turn to the applications for leave to appeal against conviction. Hamilton had a previous conviction for possession of a bladed article in June 2017, 20 months before the incident in the present case. He was 14 years old at the time of that previous conviction and 16 at the time of the instant trial. His ground of appeal against conviction is that the judge was wrong to accede to the prosecution application to admit the previous conviction as evidence of misconduct and that its admission was unfairly prejudicial to Hamilton's defence. It is instructive to note the basis of plea which Hamilton sought to tender in a document dated 8 October 2019 to the count of possession of a bladed article in a public place. It reads: ""i. I was in possession of the bladed article for a short period of time. ii. At no time while in possession of the bladed article (or before or afterwards) did I have any intention to use it to do harm to others, or to threaten or cause fear. iii. On 22 February 2019, after hearing a loud bang as a car collided with another, I was in a state of shock. I saw a commotion taking place in a nearby shop and I wanted to get out of the area quickly. As I cycled off, someone stopped me and passed me a bladed article which I put down the waistband of my trousers before I cycled away."" This basis was not acceptable to the prosecution. In his written ruling on various applications relating to evidence Judge Foster said this of the prosecution application to admit the previous conviction: ""The jury will have to consider his [Hamilton's] explanation for the possession of the knife in the light of all the evidence in the case  not just the few seconds of CCTV when any exchange of knives might have taken place. Furthermore his young age at the time of the previous conviction must be considered alongside his guilty plea for knife possession on the night in question. I am satisfied that the previous conviction is properly admissible not just because it is capable of showing a propensity to carry knives but also as rebuttal of how he says he came to be in possession of a knife on 22 February, 2019."" Mr Moloney emphasises that the previous conviction was recorded when the defendant was only 14 and related to very different circumstances. It was, he argued, just a case of a school boy carrying a kitchen knife in his bag. There was no suggestion that it was used to commit any act of violence. The penalty imposed was a referral order. He argued that this was a single incident, nearly 2 years before the index charges, and could not be a sufficient basis to admit the previous conviction as evidencing a propensity to carry a knife. The conviction could not, independently of propensity, rebut the applicant's account of his possession of the knife on the night in question. It was also submitted to us, as it was to the judge, that the legitimate public concern surrounding possession and use of knives in London could lead to unwarranted prejudice on the part of the jury. It was unfair for the conviction to have been admitted when it went to such a fundamental aspect of Hamilton's defence. Mr Moloney accepted that if the jury were satisfied that Hamilton brought a knife to the scene, his defence, as crisply summarised in paragraph iii of the basis of plea, would be in some difficulty. Mr Glasgow contends that whether Hamilton was armed with a knife throughout the attacks on Mr Gabbidon-Lynck and Mr Fraser was an important matter in issue between the prosecution and the defendant, although it was not the fundamental question in the case. The fundamental question was whether the prosecution could satisfy the jury that Hamilton was part of the group who carried out either or both of the attacks, in the sense that he assisted or encouraged those who actually inflicted the wounds on either or both of the victims. The judge's ruling was made in the context of a case where Hamilton accepted that he was linked to the Northumberland Park Killers who had a bloody rivalry with the Wood Green Mob, where Hamilton had set off by bicycle that evening in the company of a group that contained the other defendants in the case, and where the CCTV footage showed that all of his co-defendants had been armed either with a firearm (in the case of Cookhorn) or with large knives. Hamilton was standing next to his friends when they were holding their knives and, at one point on the CCTV as we have noted, his arm can be seen going to the waistband of his trousers which the prosecution say suggested he too had a knife; he had followed some of his co-defendants down an alleyway that led to a gate where Fraser was attacked; he then dismounted from his cycle and ran with it towards the salon where Mr Gabbidon-Lynck was being stabbed to death; finally, on returning to the car park he and the others changed out of their clothes and evaded detection by the police before taking a minicab home. Mr Moloney referred us to the very well-known passage in the judgment of this court delivered by the then Vice-President (Rose LJ) in Hanson [2005] 1 WLR 3169 at paragraph 9: ""There is no minimum number of events necessary to demonstrate such a propensity. The fewer the number of convictions the weaker is likely to be the evidence of propensity. A single previous conviction for an offence of the same description or category will often not show propensity. But it may do so where, for example, it shows a tendency to unusual behaviour or where its circumstances demonstrate probative force in relation to the offence charged (compare DPP v P [1991] 2 AC 447 at 460E to 461A). Child sexual abuse or fire setting are comparatively clear examples of such unusual behaviour but we attempt no exhaustive list. Circumstances demonstrating probative force are not confined to those sharing striking similarity. So, a single conviction for shoplifting, will not, without more, be admissible to show propensity to steal. But if the modus operandi has significant features shared by the offence charged it may show propensity."" The possession of a bladed article in a public place is, sadly, not unusual behaviour. But the circumstances of this previous conviction, in our view, demonstrate probative force in relation to the offence charged. It was an important aspect of Hamilton's defence that while he had no real choice but to admit having been in possession of a knife on the night in question, since it was visible on CCTV at the very end of the events which were the subject of the charges, it was, according to him, handed to him at a very late stage, possibly after the fatal stabbing of Mr Gabbidon-Lynck, rather than having been brought by him to the scene. The fact of the previous conviction for the identical offence in law only 20 months earlier went directly to this important matter in issue between him and the prosecution and did so irrespective of the details of the facts underlying the previous conviction, such as the precise size and type of the bladed article which he had in his possession on that occasion. It was for the jury to decide what weight to attach to the previous conviction. We see no reason why it should have been kept secret from them. Accordingly, we refuse Hamilton's renewed application for permission to appeal against conviction. Lyons applies for permission to appeal against conviction on an entirely different ground. The judge held a ground rules hearing at which he directed that cross-examination should on the whole not be repeated as between co-defendants and the prosecution, although that could be reviewed once a defendant had given evidence-in-chief. Questions should be asked in a logical order without jumping around from topic to topic. Questioning should be slowed down to give the witness ample time to respond. Questions should be as simple as possible, avoid legal jargon, use age appropriate words and should not be tagged and there should be regular breaks with sessions lasting no longer than 1 hour. No complaint is made on behalf of Lyons about these directions, nor could it be. The argument is rather than the directions were not adhered to, or not sufficiently adhered to, by Mr Glasgow QC for the prosecution during his cross-examination of Lyons. Mr Aldeiri, who has appeared in this Court, submits, adopting the written submissions of Mr John Cooper QC who led the defence of Lyons at trial, that the appellant was exhausted following intense cross-examination that was beyond the scope of the ground rules. It is submitted that the judge's control of that situation was inadequate with him merely commenting that it was simply Mr Glasgow's style of advocacy. We have read the transcript of the cross-examination of Mr Lyons. There were four sessions timed as follows: from 11.35 to 12.11; from 12.37 to 13.02; from 14.11 to 14.59 and 15.38 to 16.15. In our view, Mr Glasgow conducted the cross-examination with proper courtesy and care. In the first session the most pointed question he asks Lyons is: ""Why Ojay Hamilton should lie about you being there""? In the second session there is a point at which Mr Glasgow is questioning the defendant about whether he is the person shown in particular CCTV footage. There is an objection raised by Mr Cooper and when the objection is repeated a little later the judge tells Mr Glasgow to move on to another topic, which he does. Later, just before the lunch break, Mr Cooper accuses Mr Glasgow of hectoring the witness but, in our opinion, the transcript does not support that proposition. In the third session at page Y189 the defendant says that he got a minicab from his home that evening. Mr Glasgow asks: ""If there is no record of a cab going to your address on that evening does that mean you are lying?"" Mr Cooper objects to the question. Mr Glasgow then puts it to the witness in a slightly different form: ""If you are telling the truth and they keep their records there will be a record?"" At this point Mr Cooper asks for the jury to be sent out. The transcript unhelpfully does not record the discussion in the absence of the jury but what it does show is that nine minutes later they are brought back into court and from that point on there is no reference by Mr Glasgow to lying. Although the days of counsel haranguing witnesses with repeated accusations that they are lying should be over, we do not think that the questioning on this (or any other) point was at all inappropriate even when put to a 16-year-old witness. It was perfectly fair to put to the defendant that, if what he was saying about having got a minicab from home to the scene was true, that fact should be confirmed by the records which all minicab companies keep. In the final session at page Y207 of the transcript it seems that someone's mobile phone goes off. Mr Cooper asks Mr Glasgow to stop questioning and he does so with an apology. Then at page Y211 Mr Cooper asks Mr Glasgow to slow down the questioning a bit and the judge agrees. Mr Glasgow asks the witness whether he needs a break, the witness says ""no"". At page Y228 Mr Cooper, not the witness, says that the witness is looking tired, Mr Glasgow offers to break off until Monday, the defendant says, ""No, carry on"". The judge tell Mr Glasgow to try to finish the topic in 5 minutes, which he does, and the court rises for the day. We consider that this questioning comes nowhere near being oppressive or unfair. Lyons' renewed application for permission to appeal against conviction is therefore refused. Thursday 11 March 2021: LORD JUSTICE BEAN: We are now announcing our decision on sentence in this case, in which we gave judgment on Tuesday refusing two applications for permission to appeal against conviction. We begin by dealing with two technical points raised by the ever-vigilant staff of the Criminal Appeal Office. The first is that the judge imposed concurrent sentences of detention for 8 years on each of these defendants on the charge of wounding Jason Fraser with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The judge did not expressly refer to section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, but that was plainly what he had in mind. The court record should be amended to reflect the fact that these concurrent sentences were imposed pursuant to that provision. The second technical point is that the judge erred in imposing concurrent sentences on the charge of possession of a bladed article of 15 months on Hamilton and 12 months on O'Neill-Crichlow and Lyons. These were unlawful because section 91 of the 2000 Act is not available for this offence. A concurrent detention and training order would plainly have been inappropriate. We quash the three sentences in respect of the bladed article charges and substitute an order that there will be no separate penalty. Neither of these technical points alters by so much as a day the time which any of the defendants will spend in custody, but it is right to put the record straight. We turn to matters of substance. It is important to bear in mind in a case of this kind where a defendant has been convicted of murder and also of a separate serious offence, that the correct practice is to fix a minimum term of imprisonment or detention for the murder which is the appropriate penalty for the offences as a whole (see section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003) and then to impose concurrent sentences for the other offence or offences. This was the course followed by the judge in the present case and no complaint is or could be made of it. It is common ground that the statutory starting point for the murder alone was 12 years in the case of each of these appellants and applicant, but that a very significant increase from that figure was inevitable. There were numerous aggravating features of these offences. These were aptly summarised by the judge in his sentencing remarks at page 7C-G: ""The most serious extra aggravating feature is the gang-related background to this case. The tragedy of that background is as futile as it is evil. The pointless gang rivalry has resulted in the loss of one young man's life, the serious injury to another and five young men who will spend at the very least the best years of their lives in custody. You were all linked to one gang, the North London Park Killers and this was a planned and premeditated mission to find and attack members of a rival gang. The message must be understood that young people who involve themselves in this sort of conduct can expect little mercy from the Courts. That is why I have lifted all reporting restrictions not withstanding your ages so that other young people and their families can know of the consequences of such conduct. Your actions terrified innocent members of the public going about their business on a Friday evening, first of all in the Hollywood Green area of Wood Green and then in and around the hair salon on Temple Terrace. The murder was witnessed by a four year old child and the owner of the salon was so traumatised by what she saw that she was too ill to give live evidence at your trial, some nine months later. The victim personal statements from a grieving family makes sad reading."" The judge began by considering the appropriate starting point in sentencing Cookhorn. He said: ""By paragraph 5.1 of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 for an offender who commits murder when over 18 and where the seriousness of the offence or the combination of the offence and one-on-one offences associated with it is particularly high the starting point is a minimum term of 30 years. Paragraph 5.2 provides that a murder involved in the use of a firearm will normally fall within this category. I am satisfied that for you, Sheareem Cookhorn, that this is the appropriate starting point and is the factual basis on which I set the minimum term for the remainder of you. "" It is submitted that when the judge said ""and is the factual basis on which I set the minimum term for the remainder of you"" he meant that he was holding that the minimum term that would have been appropriate in each of the cases before us (that is to say all the defendants except Cookhorn) would have been 30 years. It is submitted that this case was not, at least as regards the defendants other than Cookhorn, a murder involving the use of a firearm. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether, as a matter of law, a murder in which a firearm is brought to the scene and fired but does not cause injury and in which the victim is then stabbed to death is ""a murder involving the use of a firearm"". Even if were not, a notional starting point of a minimum term of 30 years for all of these defendants, if they had been over 18 years of age, would have been justified. As the judge noted, paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 21 provides that, if the seriousness of the offence or the combination of the offence of murder and one or more offences associated with it is particularly high (not exceptionally high as it has to be for a whole life order), the appropriate starting point is 30 years. The starting point for murder by an adult, with a weapon taken to the scene with the intent to use it to commit an offence or to have it available for such use, is 25 years by virtue of paragraph 5A of Schedule 21. Here there was a murder by stabbing, using one or more knives taken to the scene, and in addition (a) the discharge of a firearm by Cookhorn and (b) the ferocious attack on Jason Fraser, who was lucky to escape with his life. Had the defendants been adults, therefore, a statutory starting point of 30 years would certainly have been justified in the case of Graham and possibly also in the case of the other defendants. On behalf of Graham, who was only two months short of his 18th birthday at the time of the murder, it is submitted that a minimum term of 25 years in his case was excessive because (a) the judge was wrong to conclude that the applicant was a principal offender in relation to the murder, (b) the judge was wrong to find that there was sufficient evidence of significant premeditation or planning as an aggravating factor and (c) he failed to take sufficient account of the applicant's age and level of maturity at the time of the offending. In refusing permission to appeal on the papers the single judge said: ""Your pursuit of the victim into the hairdressers and repeated stabbing of him in front of terrified customers including a 4 year old girl, was enough to mark this murder out as justifying a significant uplift from the starting point of 12 years by reason of your age. Given that you continued to associate with Cookhorn after he first discharged the gun the judge was also entitled to take into account when sentencing you your knowledge of his having a gun and his willingness to use it without regard to the danger posed to innocent passers-by. Moreover, having tried you and all your co-defendants, the judge was best placed to evaluate your role in the offences and your culpability for it and he was satisfied that you were one of the ringleaders and one of the two responsible for inflicting the violence on the victims. Despite your age I do not consider it is reasonably arguable that either the minimum tariff of 25 years for the murder or the 20-year sentence for the attempted murder in your case was manifestly excessive."" We agree, and the renewed application by Graham is refused. We turn to the other three defendants, each of whom appeals by leave of the single judge. In each case counsel can point to the judge's express findings in his sentencing remarks that they did not have an intention to kill Mr Gabbidon-Lynck (nor of course Mr Fraser, given that they were acquitted of attempted murder); that each of them was a secondary party to both offences; and to the fact that each of them was aged only 16 at the time of the offences. The additional points made in the individual cases are as follows. O'Neill-Crichlow was not involved in the McDonald's incident. It is argued that even after that his role was less than that of Hamilton or Lyons. But in the absence of any finding to that effect by the sentencing judge, who had heard all the evidence in the case, we are not prepared to make a distinction on those grounds. It must also be said against him that the gang made use of his mother's car, not, it seems, as a prospective getaway vehicle but as a repository for clothing so that they could change clothes before and after the violent encounter in the hope of avoiding detection. O'Neill-Crichlow had no previous convictions, but one previous reprimand for possession of a bladed article. Hamilton was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had an IQ of only 80. Although the judge had seen him give evidence, it may be that to say that his maturity was only ""slightly less than his biological age"" was understating this point a little. On the other hand, his previous conviction for possession of a bladed article was a point against him. Lyons was the youngest defendant, being 4 months younger than Hamilton. A pre-sentence report expressed the opinion that he was immature and easily led. He had no previous convictions at all, although the judge took a poor view of the fact that a knife was found in his bedroom carefully wrapped in a sock. We will follow the judge's lead in this respect. We do not consider there is any basis for distinguishing between these three defendants. An important recent decision to which we were referred was Davies [2020] EWCA Crim 921 , delivered on 29 April 2020 (that is to say after the judge passed sentence in the present case). The judgment of this court was delivered by Lord Burnett of Maldon CJ. Davies had been convicted of a murder committed when he was 16-year-old 2 months old. There were many similarities between the Davies case and the present one. A number of members of one gang set upon a member of another gang, and between them stabbed him fifteen times. The victim died shortly afterwards. The court set out the factual conclusions of the sentencing judge at paragraph 10: ""(i) The appellant had been responsible for corralling the group which proceeded to kill the deceased. Despite his age, the appellant was influential in the gang. (ii) The attack was a premeditated, targeted revenge attack. (iii) The appellant  and indeed the others convicted of murder  had an intention to kill the deceased. (iv) The appellant and [his co-accused] Yenge took the two knives used in the attack to the scene, but all knew that knives were there and to be used. (v) Overall, the appellant had a prominent, leading role in what occurred. (vi) The killing was the result of a long-standing hostility between the gangs. (vii) All the co-accused had taken care to turn off their telephones to avoid the possibility of their movements being traced. After the attack, they not only disposed of their weapons, but also washed their bodies and clothes in an attempt to eliminate forensic traces."" The Lord Chief Justice said at paragraph 22: ""The aggravating features identified by the judge in his sentencing remarks are unimpeachable, but we find ourselves in respectful disagreement with the judge's conclusion that, despite the appellant's youth and background, the starting point should be as high as 21 years. The appellant was a good deal younger than the others. That is itself a factor which carries significant weight. Moreover, a striking feature of this case is the appellant's circumstances, which we have summarised. They led him to be a drug user at 11, an addict by 13, and by the same age a professional drug dealer. By then he had been swept up into gang violence. Violence had been a constant background of his life from a very early age."" The minimum term of 21 years imposed on Davies was reduced by this Court to one of 16 years. No two cases are identical, and of course Davies was only being sentenced for a single murder. On the other hand, unlike the three appellants whose cases we are now considering, he was the principal offender and leader of the group which attacked the victim. The decision in Davies , which was not available to Judge Foster, does suggest to us that if the present case had involved the single murder alone, the appropriate minimum terms for these three appellants would have been no higher than 16 years and possibly a little less. Putting these factors together, we have come to the conclusion that the minimum terms of 21 years did not make adequate allowance for the youth and immaturity of these three defendants. We will in each case quash the minimum term of 21 years and substitute a term of 19 years. Time spent in custody prior to sentencing will count towards the minimum term in the usual way. The result is that the earliest time when these three appellants will be eligible for release will be in 2038, by which time they will be 35 years old. Even then, each of them will only be released if the Parole Board is satisfied that it is safe to do so. These remain severe sentences for defendants who were aged only 16 when the offences were committed, but they are appropriate ones in such a serious case."

Neutral Citation Number: [2021] EWCA Crim 113 CASE No. 2021 00420 A3 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL CRIMINAL DIVISION (SITTING AT MOLD CROWN COURT) The Law Courts, Raikes Ln, Mold CH7 1AE 22 June 2021 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE MR JUSTICE SWEENEY MR JUSTICE PICKEN ____________________ REGINA v MATTHEW WILLIAM MASON ____________________ Computer Aided Transcript of Epiq Europe Ltd, Lower Ground, 18-22 Furnival Street, London EC4A 1JS Tel No: 020 7404 1400; Email: rcj@epiqglobal.co.uk (Official Shorthand Writers to the Court) ____________________ MR GORDON COLE QC appeared on behalf of the APPELLANT MR IAN UNSWORTH QC appeared on behalf of the CROWN ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT (APPROVED) ____________________ Crown Copyright © LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE: The appellant, now aged 20, appeals by leave of the single judge against his sentence for an offence of murder committed when he was 18 years old. In particular he appeals against the minimum term of 28 years which he was ordered to serve before being eligible for consideration for release on life licence. We begin by referring to a reporting direction under section 45A of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 which was made in the Crown Court. This relates to a number of young persons, friends and family of the deceased. They have been named earlier in this hearing but for the purposes of this judgment we shall refer to them as A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. The direction states that, during their respective lifetimes, no matter may be included in any publication if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify them as persons concerned in those proceedings. In particular, no publication shall include any of their names, addresses, educational establishments or places of work, or any still or moving images of them. For the avoidance of any doubt, we emphasise that that direction remains in force, and we make a similar direction in respect of any publication reporting the proceedings in this court. The appellant was 18 years 10 months old at the time of the murder in December 2019. He had no previous convictions. His victim, Alexander Rodda ('Alex'), was aged just 15 years 9 months. It appears that they had known one another at school. In 2019 Alex initiated correspondence via social media, which seems quickly to have become sexual. The appellant sent a picture of his erect penis to Alex. The two met on a number of occasions and engaged in penetrative sexual activity, both oral and anal. In November 2019 Alex messaged the appellant's girlfriend. He told her about the sending of the photograph of the appellant's penis and about their meeting. As a result, she ended her relationship with the appellant. On the following day the appellant made the first of a series of payments to Alex which eventually totalled more than £2,000. It appears that the appellant was very anxious that his sexual relationship with Alex should not be disclosed. Alex told a friend that the appellant was paying him for sex and that he would report the appellant to the police if the payments stopped. The friend protested that this was a form of blackmail and was wrong, but Alex seems not to have been deterred. Nor did he show any sympathy when the appellant protested that the payments were emptying his bank account. On 6 December 2019 the appellant made internet searches on topics such as poisons and unsolved deaths of missing persons. The appellant and Alex met on 9 December 2019. That day the appellant sent £102 to Alex, which left him with a balance of £26 in his bank account. They met again on 12 December. The appellant had told Alex that he would take him to a special secret place where they could have sex. They drove in the appellant's car to a wooded area and walked into the woods. The appellant was armed with a heavy spanner, concealed in his sleeve. It seems that Alex knelt in front of the appellant. Whilst he was in that vulnerable position, the appellant struck heavy blows to Alex's head with the spanner. The initial blows would have rendered Alex unconscious, but the appellant continued his attack, causing multiple lacerations and fracturing the skull. Having bludgeoned Alex to death in that brutal manner, the appellant left his body in the woods and drove away. He disposed of Alex's phone, which has never been found. He went to the home of a friend to shower, and then to a pub, where he met friends and took a selfie -- apparently in an attempt to create an alibi. When Alex's friends and family later contacted the appellant, anxiously asking if he knew where Alex was, he callously lied to them. In the early hours of the following morning the police sent a text message to the appellant, telling him to contact them. Instead of doing so he drove back to the woods, where he spent about an hour apparently trying to move Alex's body. When Alex's body was later found, his trousers and underpants were around his ankles. The appellant was arrested later that day. The murder weapon was found in the boot of his car. When interviewed under caution he made no comment. At his trial in the Crown Court at Chester before the Honorary Recorder of that city, His Honour Judge Everett, the appellant admitted killing Alex but said he had acted in self-defence. In the alternative he put forward the partial defence of loss of control. The jury, who must have disbelieved his evidence, convicted him of murder. At the sentencing hearing on 25 January 2021 the judge began his sentencing remarks by saying to the appellant: ""I have to sentence you for the murder of a 15-year-old boy, something I tell you now, I'm not convinced you ever really appreciated at any stage."" The judge referred to the victim personal statements from Alex's parents. Each member of this court has read those statements. They vividly express the anguish which Alex's murder has brought to his family and friends. It is clear, as the judge rightly said, that they will never recover from their loss. No sentence of any court can do anything to make good that loss, and like the judge we can do no more than make our decision in accordance with the law. In doing so we have well in mind the human realities for the bereaved whose lives have been blighted by this dreadful murder, and we extend our sympathy to them. The judge accepted that it had been Alex who initiated the social media correspondence but said that thereafter the appellant had actively encouraged what was for Alex his first real sexual experiences. He pointed out that the appellant had committed serious sexual offences against a young and naïve victim which would in themselves have resulted in a sentence of custody, and the appellant, he said, had been motivated by self-interest throughout. Although Alex had demanded money to keep quiet about the sexual offending, the judge regarded that as naïve behaviour by a 15-year-old with no real understanding of the consequences of his actions. The appellant, in contrast, was not only 3 years older but also ""much more worldly wise and mature"" than his victim. It was, pointed out the judge, the appellant's choice to engage in the sexual activity which had led to the situation in which he was being pressed for money. The judge, as he was required by law to do, imposed the sentence of custody for life. In determining the minimum term which the appellant must serve before he can even be considered for release on licence, the judge agreed with the submission of both counsel that the appropriate starting point was one of 25 years, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Schedule 21 to the Sentencing Code established by the Sentencing Act 2020. He took into account the following aggravating factors: the murder was committed at least in part to prevent disclosure of the unlawful sexual relationship; it was planned and premeditated; the appellant intended to kill and ""went about it with a ruthlessness that utterly beggars belief for any person but particularly for a person still in their teens""; he had left Alex to die; he had disposed of important evidence, tried to establish a false alibi and tried to dispose of Alex's body. The judge identified three mitigating factors. First, he accepted that the murder had been committed at least in part because of the demands for money which had been made. Secondly, he accepted the evidence of positive good character given by a number of witnesses who knew the appellant. Thirdly, he said, ""I keep in mind that you were only 18 at the time, but only to a limited extent keeping in mind your careful planning"". The judge concluded that the aggravating features would have increased the minimum term from the statutory starting point of 25 years to 30 years. The mitigating factors in his view made it appropriate to reduce that by 2 years. Thus the judge set a minimum term of 28 years. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Cole QC submits that the minimum term is manifestly excessive in length. He submits that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the appellant's youth, positive good character and the fact that he was being blackmailed. He points to evidence given at trial by the witnesses who spoke of the appellant's good character and described him as a young man who was not by nature violent or aggressive. Mr Cole further points out that the evidence given by friends of the appellant showed that in the period leading up to the murder he had become withdrawn and depressed and, unusually, was asking people to lend him money. Mr Cole suggests that the appellant was frightened of others finding out that he had a homosexual relationship. Mr Cole readily acknowledges the aggravating features of the case but submits that there was strong mitigation which was not given sufficient weight. Mr Unsworth QC, for the respondent, submits that the judge took the appropriate starting point and correctly identified the relevant aggravating and mitigating features. He submits that it is important to keep in mind that the jury rejected the partial defence of loss of control. He submits that the judge made proper allowance for the appellant's age and previous good character and the circumstances in which the appellant was paying money to Alex. The judge's conclusions, submits Mr Unsworth, were soundly based on the evidence and, having presided over a lengthy trial, he was in the best position to determine what weight to give to the various factors. We are grateful to counsel, both of whom appeared at the trial, for their very helpful written and oral submissions. Very recently, in the case of R v Popoola [2021] EWCA Crim 842 , a constitution of this court considered (at paragraphs 22 to 29) the principles applicable when sentencing a young adult convicted of murder. That decision was not of course available to the judge in this case. In Popoola , as in this case, the appropriate starting point under the relevant statutory provision was a minimum term of 25 years for an adult offender, but would have been 12 years if the offender were aged under 18 at the time of the murder. Referring to the well-known cases of R v Peters & Others [2005] EWCA Crim 605 and Attorney-General's Reference (R v Clarke) [2018] EWCA Crim 185 , and to the Sentencing Council's General Guideline: Overarching Principles, the court in Popoola emphasised the need to consider not only the chronological age but also the maturity of a young adult offender. In the present case, the judge was faced with a difficult sentencing process. He was clearly correct to regard this murder as a dreadful crime, which the appellant had planned, ruthlessly executed and then tried to cover up. The judge was in the best position to assess the appellant, and he was plainly entitled to find that the appellant was much more mature than his victim and was motivated throughout by selfish considerations. The element of blackmail by Alex was rightly set in the context of the appellant's own criminality in committing sexual offences against a boy of 15. However, the judge also had to give appropriate weight to the appellant's young age. The appellant was of course an adult, and there is nothing to suggest that he was any less mature than his contemporaries. The judge did not, however, say anything to suggest that he found the appellant to be significantly more mature than others aged under 19. We note in this regard the opening words of the sentencing remarks to which we have referred. As the Lord Chief Justice said in the case of Clarke , ""full maturity and all the attributes of adulthood are not magically conferred on young people on their 18th birthdays"". The significance of that principle in the present case, in our view, is that it affects the weight to be given to the appellant's culpability in committing sexual offences against Alex and to the element of planning and premeditation of the murder. Those serious aggravating features were undoubtedly present, but they were the conduct of an 18-year-old, who, according to the witnesses, was not generally violent or aggressive and who had been blackmailed into parting with almost all his money. In particular the judge, as we have noted, expressly limited the weight to be given to the appellant's young age because of his ""careful planning""; but it was the planning of an 18-year-old, threatened with the revelation of a homosexual relationship which he wished to conceal. The reaction to such a threat of a very young adult is in our view likely to be significantly less considered than the reaction of a mature adult. We hesitate to differ from the judge. We are, however, persuaded with all respect to him that he fell into error. He rightly observed the distinctions in age and maturity between the appellant and his young victim, but he then failed to give sufficient weight to the appellant's age, level of maturity and previous good character. We agree with the judge that the aggravating features outweighed the mitigating and that it was necessary to make an upward adjustment from the statutory starting point. But in our judgment the appropriate adjustment was to a minimum term of 26 years and that 28 years was manifestly excessive. We therefore allow the appeal to this limited extent. We quash the sentence of custody for life with a minimum term of 28 years less the 406 days on remand in custody. We substitute for it a sentence of custody for life with a minimum term of 26 years less the 406 days on remand in custody. Mr Cole and Mr Unsworth, perhaps you would be good enough to agree the arithmetic between you and pass a note to the Registrar so that the appropriate term of years can be entered in the court record. MR UNSWORTH: Of course. MR COLE: Yes. LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE: Thank you very much. Thank you both.

In particular he appeals against the minimum term of 28 years which he was ordered to serve before being eligible for consideration for release on life licence. We begin by referring to a reporting direction under section 45A of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 which was made in the Crown Court. This relates to a number of young persons, friends and family of the deceased. They have been named earlier in this hearing but for the purposes of this judgment we shall refer to them as A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. The direction states that, during their respective lifetimes, no matter may be included in any publication if it is likely to lead members of the public to identify them as persons concerned in those proceedings.

For the avoidance of any doubt, we emphasise that that direction remains in force, and we make a similar direction in respect of any publication reporting the proceedings in this court. The appellant was 18 years 10 months old at the time of the murder in December 2019. He had no previous convictions. His victim, Alexander Rodda ('Alex'), was aged just 15 years 9 months. It appears that they had known one another at school. In 2019 Alex initiated correspondence via social media, which seems quickly to have become sexual. The appellant sent a picture of his erect penis to Alex. The two met on a number of occasions and engaged in penetrative sexual activity, both oral and anal. In November 2019 Alex messaged the appellant's girlfriend. He told her about the sending of the photograph of the appellant's penis and about their meeting. As a result, she ended her relationship with the appellant. On the following day the appellant made the first of a series of payments to Alex which eventually totalled more than £2,000. It appears that the appellant was very anxious that his sexual relationship with Alex should not be disclosed. Alex told a friend that the appellant was paying him for sex and that he would report the appellant to the police if the payments stopped. The friend protested that this was a form of blackmail and was wrong, but Alex seems not to have been deterred. Nor did he show any sympathy when the appellant protested that the payments were emptying his bank account.

The judge referred to the victim personal statements from Alex's parents. Each member of this court has read those statements. They vividly express the anguish which Alex's murder has brought to his family and friends. It is clear, as the judge rightly said, that they will never recover from their loss. No sentence of any court can do anything to make good that loss, and like the judge we can do no more than make our decision in accordance with the law. In doing so we have well in mind the human realities for the bereaved whose lives have been blighted by this dreadful murder, and we extend our sympathy to them. The judge accepted that it had been Alex who initiated the social media correspondence but said that thereafter the appellant had actively encouraged what was for Alex his first real sexual experiences. He pointed out that the appellant had committed serious sexual offences against a young and naïve victim which would in themselves have resulted in a sentence of custody, and the appellant, he said, had been motivated by self-interest throughout. Although Alex had demanded money to keep quiet about the sexual offending, the judge regarded that as naïve behaviour by a 15-year-old with no real understanding of the consequences of his actions. The appellant, in contrast, was not only 3 years older but also ""much more worldly wise and mature"" than his victim. It was, pointed out the judge, the appellant's choice to engage in the sexual activity which had led to the situation in which he was being pressed for money. The judge, as he was required by law to do, imposed the sentence of custody for life. In determining the minimum term which the appellant must serve before he can even be considered for release on licence, the judge agreed with the submission of both counsel that the appropriate starting point was one of 25 years, in accordance with paragraph 4 of Schedule 21 to the Sentencing Code established by the Sentencing Act 2020. He took into account the following aggravating factors: the murder was committed at least in part to prevent disclosure of the unlawful sexual relationship; it was planned and premeditated; the appellant intended to kill and ""went about it with a ruthlessness that utterly beggars belief for any person but particularly for a person still in their teens""; he had left Alex to die; he had disposed of important evidence, tried to establish a false alibi and tried to dispose of Alex's body. The judge identified three mitigating factors. First, he accepted that the murder had been committed at least in part because of the demands for money which had been made. Secondly, he accepted the evidence of positive good character given by a number of witnesses who knew the appellant. Thirdly, he said, ""I keep in mind that you were only 18 at the time, but only to a limited extent keeping in mind your careful planning"". The judge concluded that the aggravating features would have increased the minimum term from the statutory starting point of 25 years to 30 years. The mitigating factors in his view made it appropriate to reduce that by 2 years. Thus the judge set a minimum term of 28 years. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Cole QC submits that the minimum term is manifestly excessive in length. He submits that the judge failed to give sufficient weight to the appellant's youth, positive good character and the fact that he was being blackmailed. He points to evidence given at trial by the witnesses who spoke of the appellant's good character and described him as a young man who was not by nature violent or aggressive. Mr Cole further points out that the evidence given by friends of the appellant showed that in the period leading up to the murder he had become withdrawn and depressed and, unusually, was asking people to lend him money. Mr Cole suggests that the appellant was frightened of others finding out that he had a homosexual relationship. Mr Cole readily acknowledges the aggravating features of the case but submits that there was strong mitigation which was not given sufficient weight. Mr Unsworth QC, for the respondent, submits that the judge took the appropriate starting point and correctly identified the relevant aggravating and mitigating features. He submits that it is important to keep in mind that the jury rejected the partial defence of loss of control. He submits that the judge made proper allowance for the appellant's age and previous good character and the circumstances in which the appellant was paying money to Alex. The judge's conclusions, submits Mr Unsworth, were soundly based on the evidence and, having presided over a lengthy trial, he was in the best position to determine what weight to give to the various factors. We are grateful to counsel, both of whom appeared at the trial, for their very helpful written and oral submissions. Very recently, in the case of R v Popoola [2021] EWCA Crim 842 , a constitution of this court considered (at paragraphs 22 to 29) the principles applicable when sentencing a young adult convicted of murder. That decision was not of course available to the judge in this case. In Popoola , as in this case, the appropriate starting point under the relevant statutory provision was a minimum term of 25 years for an adult offender, but would have been 12 years if the offender were aged under 18 at the time of the murder. Referring to the well-known cases of R v Peters & Others [2005] EWCA Crim 605 and Attorney-General's Reference (R v Clarke) [2018] EWCA Crim 185 , and to the Sentencing Council's General Guideline: Overarching Principles, the court in Popoola emphasised the need to consider not only the chronological age but also the maturity of a young adult offender. In the present case, the judge was faced with a difficult sentencing process. He was clearly correct to regard this murder as a dreadful crime, which the appellant had planned, ruthlessly executed and then tried to cover up. The judge was in the best position to assess the appellant, and he was plainly entitled to find that the appellant was much more mature than his victim and was motivated throughout by selfish considerations. The element of blackmail by Alex was rightly set in the context of the appellant's own criminality in committing sexual offences against a boy of 15. However, the judge also had to give appropriate weight to the appellant's young age. The appellant was of course an adult, and there is nothing to suggest that he was any less mature than his contemporaries. The judge did not, however, say anything to suggest that he found the appellant to be significantly more mature than others aged under 19. We note in this regard the opening words of the sentencing remarks to which we have referred. As the Lord Chief Justice said in the case of Clarke , ""full maturity and all the attributes of adulthood are not magically conferred on young people on their 18th birthdays"". The significance of that principle in the present case, in our view, is that it affects the weight to be given to the appellant's culpability in committing sexual offences against Alex and to the element of planning and premeditation of the murder. Those serious aggravating features were undoubtedly present, but they were the conduct of an 18-year-old, who, according to the witnesses, was not generally violent or aggressive and who had been blackmailed into parting with almost all his money. In particular the judge, as we have noted, expressly limited the weight to be given to the appellant's young age because of his ""careful planning""; but it was the planning of an 18-year-old, threatened with the revelation of a homosexual relationship which he wished to conceal. The reaction to such a threat of a very young adult is in our view likely to be significantly less considered than the reaction of a mature adult. We hesitate to differ from the judge. We are, however, persuaded with all respect to him that he fell into error. He rightly observed the distinctions in age and maturity between the appellant and his young victim, but he then failed to give sufficient weight to the appellant's age, level of maturity and previous good character. We agree with the judge that the aggravating features outweighed the mitigating and that it was necessary to make an upward adjustment from the statutory starting point. But in our judgment the appropriate adjustment was to a minimum term of 26 years and that 28 years was manifestly excessive. We therefore allow the appeal to this limited extent. We quash the sentence of custody for life with a minimum term of 28 years less the 406 days on remand in custody. We substitute for it a sentence of custody for life with a minimum term of 26 years less the 406 days on remand in custody. Mr Cole and Mr Unsworth, perhaps you would be good enough to agree the arithmetic between you and pass a note to the Registrar so that the appropriate term of years can be entered in the court record. MR UNSWORTH: Of course. MR COLE: Yes. LORD JUSTICE HOLROYDE: Thank you very much. Thank you both."

The particulars of the offence were that Mehtab Laqab having committed a relevant offence, namely the murder of Abed Hussain, the appellant, knowing or believing that Mehtab Laqab had committed the said offence or some other relevant offence, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse disposed of a stone pestle, with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution of Mehtab Laqab. The appellant was sentenced on 6 July to four years' imprisonment. He appeals against sentence by leave of the single judge. The co-accused Mehtab Laqab and Ateek Laqab were convicted on count 1 which charged them with murder. The facts are these. The appellant was a drug dealer. On the evening of 19 December 2006 he spent some time with the deceased, Hussain, who was the father of three children, and two others, Farni and Arsen. The men travelled back to the appellant's home address. On the way Hussain quarrelled with the appellant. He claimed that the appellant had told Hussain's wife that he was back on drink and drugs and he demanded the payment of £10,000 with threats of violence. During the journey Hussain bullied the appellant and slapped him. The appellant arrived home and went in doors. He was in tears. Hussain grabbed hold of Farni and made him go close to the house before all three men left and walked away up the road. The appellant told his two brothers (the co-accused) what had happened. They decided to do something about it. Their mother tried to persuade them to stay in the house, but they ignored her. Ateek armed himself with a screwdriver and Mehtab with a stone pestle about six inches long. All three brothers left the house. By this time Hussain was about 80 yards away. Ateek and Mehtab caught up with him and attacked him, using their weapons to strike him on the head. Hussain fell to the ground and was struck at least one further blow before Arsen and Farni intervened to try to stop the violence. Arsen contacted the emergency service. The police and an ambulance arrived just before 1am. They found Hussain lying on his back with an obvious serious injury to his head. He was still alive, but died on the way to hospital from his head injuries. After the attack the appellant took the pestle off Mehtab and drove away. He disposed of it in a bin liner. About two days later he went to the police. When interviewed he told them that he was a drug dealer and that he had disposed of the pestle after the attack because it had blood on it. The appellant is 23 years of age. He has a number of previous convictions, mainly for road traffic offences, but he also has a conviction on 2 May 2006 for perverting the course of justice for which he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, consecutive to a sentence of two months' imprisonment for possession of a bladed article, and another conviction for obstructing the police for which he was sentenced to a 12 month community order on 5 April 2006. There were four character references before the sentencing judge. In passing sentence the judge said that in one sense the appellant was a lucky man because the whole tragedy was his fault. He had chosen to live the flash life of a drug dealer but when the going got tough, he ran crying to his younger brothers for help. He had got them into terrible trouble and had set in train events which led to the death of a close friend. He was brave with words but was not violent, unless women were concerned. He had taken care to stay out of the fight but had assisted one of his brothers by disposing of the weapon he had used. The jury's verdict meant that when he disposed of the stone pestle, he believed Hussain was doomed to die and that his brother was responsible for the death. Counsel had argued before the sentencing judge, and has made the same point to this court, that the appellant should receive credit against what would have been the normal sentence after a trial because he had never disputed that he had taken and disposed of the weapon. Counsel had argued that it was a prerequisite to the appellant's guilt that his brother should be found guilty and that he could not have pleaded guilty until the jury found his brother guilty. The judge said, however, that the appellant had maintained that he had no reason to believe Hussain had been left in the condition in which he was, and the jury had rejected that argument. He went on: ""It is difficult to apply credit on the basis I am invited to, as if this were a plea of guilty, but I do take into account the fact that you showed elements of responsibility in your candour in interview and the conduct of your defence in this trial."" The appellant's previous conviction for perverting the course of justice showed that he had a fine disregard for the rule of law. It is submitted by Mr Dunstan that the sentence of four years' imprisonment was too long. Two particular points are made. First, it is submitted that the judge should have given the appellant full credit as if he had pleaded guilty to the offence. Secondly, and in any event, having regard to other authorities, in particular R v Lee Manning [2004] 2 Cr App R(S) 74 and Attorney General's Reference No 19 of 1993 ( R v Connor Edward Downey ) (1994) 15 Cr App R(S) 760, the sentence of four years was too long. In developing the first of these points counsel submits that the appellant always accepted that he believed that his brother Mehtab had committed a relevant offence and that he was therefore guilty of the offence charged, provided that the prosecution could prove Mehtab's guilt of the primary offence. The appellant's trial was conducted on that basis; there was virtually no cross-examination of any witness. At the close of the evidence, the prosecution decided that the case should be left to the jury on the basis that the appellant knew or believed that Mehtab had committed the offence of murder or manslaughter rather than any other relevant offence such as assault occasioning actual bodily harm at the time when he disposed of the pestle. During submissions in the absence of the jury counsel made it clear that this would afford the appellant a potential defence which he had not previously anticipated having. This arose from the account given by the appellant in his police interviews which was relied on by the prosecution as truthful. In those interviews he had said that he only found out the next day that Hussain had died and that when he left the scene of the murder he had only thought that there had been a fight. Counsel submits that it was entirely reasonable for the appellant to put the Crown to proof that Mehtab had committed the offence of murder. Proof of that was a prerequisite to the appellant's guilt on the basis on which the Crown were now putting their case. Taking that into account and the fact that the appellant had gone to the police within two days of committing the offence and told them exactly what he had done, it is submitted that the judge should have given a discount equivalent to that which would have been given if he had pleaded guilty at the outset. As regards the two authorities to which we have referred, we note that in Attorney General's Reference No 19 of 1993 the offender had pleaded guilty to manslaughter and to perverting the course of public justice. When the deceased woman had rejected the offender's sexual advances, he had put his hand over her mouth to stop her from shouting and killed her. He then dismembered her body and put the parts into plastic bags which he disposed of in various places around the City. The offender did not disclose what he had done to the police for about five years. Following the Attorney General's reference, this court increased the sentence, stating that at first instance it would have been inappropriate to pass a sentence of less than two years, and three would not have been excessive for the offence of perverting the course of public justice. Mr Dunstan submits that that was a more serious offence than the present case. Taking account of both matters, it is submitted that the judge erred in passing a sentence as long as one of four years' imprisonment. We are persuaded that there is force in those submissions. We are not persuaded that the judge was wrong not to treat the appellant as if he had indicated a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, but clearly having regard to the way in which the appellant conducted his defence, he was entitled to a significant discount from the sentence which would have been appropriate had he maintained a steadfast plea of not guilty all along. We also think that there is force in the submission that the present case is somewhat less serious than Attorney General's Reference No 19 of 1993 . Nevertheless, although the appellant was not charged with the offence of murder as if party to a joint enterprise, the fact is that he assisted an offender who was convicted of the charge of murder. Taking account of all these circumstances it is our view that the correct sentence in this case was one of three years' imprisonment. Accordingly, we quash the sentence passed and substitute one of three years' imprisonment. To that extent the appeal is allowed.

LORD JUSTICE MOORE-BICK: On 20 March 2009 in the Crown Court at Sheffield before HHJ Keen QC the applicants were convicted of attempted murder on count 2 of the indictment. The applicant Thompson was also convicted of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm on count 4. Each was sentenced to 22 years' imprisonment; Thompson was sentenced to five years' imprisonment concurrent in respect of the offence of wounding with intent. In each case the judge directed that time spent in custody on remand should count against sentence. 2.1. The applicants now renew their applications for leave to appeal against sentence after refusal by the single judge. 3.1. The events giving rise to these convictions had their origins in the murder of a man named Brett Blake on 29 June 2008 in a Sheffield nightclub. Both he and the two men convicted of his murder, Danny Hockenhull and Curtis Goring, had been part of a gang associated with the S3 postcode area in Sheffield and known therefore as ""S3"". There had been serious disagreements within the gang, which had split into two factions: one associated with Hockenhull and Goring and one associated with Blake. 4.1. Nelson and Thompson were friends of Hockenhull and Goring and are said to have formed part of a faction associated with them, although it is now said by Mr Reynolds, who appears on behalf of Nelson, that there was little, if any, evidence that he had been a member of the gang. 5.1. The primary victim of the offence, a man called Junior Liversidge, was a good friend of Leyton Blake, the brother of Brett Blake. After Brett Blake's funeral on 4 July 2008 Liversidge and Leyton Blake went to a wake at a public house. At about 1.00 am they and others left in a car driven by a man called Stefan Gordon. One of the occupants of that car, Wesley Daswell, later told the police that Leyton Blake wanted to find Nelson because he believed, albeit wrongly, that he had been responsible for his brother's death. 6.1. Liversidge and Daswell saw Nelson and Thompson in a car being driven by Nelson. They swerved in front of the car in an attempt to make it stop, but at that point Nelson was able to avoid them. Shortly afterwards, Liversidge and Daswell found Nelson and Thompson again in their car, but they ran away and made their escape. Liversidge and Daswell then made off with the car, which was later found burnt out. 7.1. Nelson and Thompson set out to exact revenge on Liversidge and Daswell, whom they found in Gordon's car parked outside a hotel. They repeatedly stabbed Liversidge, causing life threatening injuries. Those injuries included wounds to the right mid-upper arm, to the left armpit, to the right side of the chest and the right side of the back. As a result, both of his lungs partially collapsed and the blood supply to the liver and bowel was disrupted. 8.1. Liversidge was taken to hospital. During four hours of surgery he required 28 pints of blood. He suffered a blocked bile duct and needed a further operation. The medical evidence suggested that he would require another operation in the near future and may require surgery at intervals for the rest of his life. The doctors said that it was rare to see an injury of that nature where the patient did not bleed to death prior to surgical intervention. This was the attack which formed the basis for count 2 of the indictment which charged the applicants with attempted murder. 9.1. In the course of the attack Wesley Daswell was also stabbed, sustaining a single wound to his leg which required three stitches. That formed the basis for count 4 of the indictment, on which Thompson was convicted and Nelson acquitted. 10.1. On 19 July 2008 Nelson was arrested and on 7 November 2008 Thompson handed himself in to the police. Neither of them answered any questions in interview. 11.1. When passing sentence the judge noted that the offences were linked to the murder of Brett Blake, of which Danny Hockenhull and Curtis Goring had been convicted and sentenced some six weeks earlier. In their case the judge had passed mandatory life sentences with a direction that they each serve a minimum of 21 years in custody. That minimum period has now been reduced by this court to 18 years in each case. 12.1. In the course of his sentencing remarks the judge commented on the similarities in terms of age and background of these applicants with those of Hockenhull and Goring. The judge had the circumstances of that case and the level of sentencing very much in mind, as he made clear. He noted that there had been an element of provocation as far as Hockenhull had been concerned, which had taken the form of an attack only a few days earlier when Brett Blake had slashed his face with a knife. He took the view that there was no comparable provocation in this case, although Liversidge and others had chased the applicants and had taken and destroyed their car. He took the view that, in both cases, there had been an element of planning and revenge. 13.1. The judge noted that the case had its background in the break-up of a street gang. He observed that violence was escalating and that it was a serious aggravating feature that the murder of Brett Blake had itself been a spur to further violence. He said that gang violence, accompanied by a lack of co-operation with the police and a code of silence, even on the part of victims, was an escalating problem in all large cities, to which Sheffield was no exception. He considered that where determinate sentences are imposed for offences committed in that context, it is necessary that they should contain an element of deterrence to demonstrate that society will not tolerate that type of culture and its associated violence. He therefore passed a sentence which he made quite clear was deliberately intended to be severe. 14.1. The grounds of appeal in each case are that the sentence was manifestly excessive, and that, unless the sentences passed in the present case are reduced to some extent, there will be an apparent element of disparity between this case and the cases of Hockenhull and Goring. 15.1. The applicants in this case are still quite young. Thompson was born on 12 April 1983. He has seven previous convictions for 12 offences, which include possessing an offensive weapon, having a bladed article in a public place, robbery, affray and common assault. Nelson was born on 9 June 1982. He has six previous convictions for 14 offences, including one offence of robbery committed in January 2002. 16.1. Guidelines on sentencing for attempted murder have, since the date of these convictions, been published by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, and although they were not in force at the time when the judge passed sentence, we consider that they provide valuable assistance in relation to the appropriate sentences for offences of this kind, as counsel accepted. 17.1. The Guidelines identify different levels of seriousness of what is, on any view, a very serious offence. Level 2 relates to a planned attempt to kill, and in a case involving serious and long-term physical or psychological harm indicates a starting point of 20 years' imprisonment with a sentencing range of 17 to 25 years' imprisonment. The indication in relation to a Level 3 offence, which includes other spontaneous attempts to kill, is 15 years' custody as a starting point, and a range of 12 to 20 years' custody in a case involving serious and long-term physical or psychological harm. 18.1. Mr Reynolds submitted that this was properly to be regarded as a level 3 case because there was no significant planning involved. In our view, it is better viewed as a level 2 case, since there was, at least at some point, a plan to pursue the victims and to do so with an intention to kill Liversidge. It is not disputed that this is a case in which he suffered serious and long-term physical harm. 19.1. The fact that the offence resulted from an element of inter-gang rivalry is, in our view, a serious aggravating factor and the judge was entitled to take the view that the sentence should therefore contain an element of deterrence. As we have already indicated, the starting point for a level 2 offence is 20 years' imprisonment, with a range of 17 to 25 years. 20.1. There are some mitigating features to the case. Mr Reynolds has reminded us that, at an earlier time during that day, Nelson was doing his best to avoid arousing hostile feelings that were liable to be generated by the funeral, and, in addition, that both these applicants are, as we have indicated, relatively young men. 21.1. In the ordinary way we do not think that the sentence passed by the judge could be described as manifestly excessive having regard to the nature and the circumstances of the offence. This was a revenge attack in the context of inter-gang rivalry, and called for a severe sentence. 22.1. Nonetheless, we are persuaded that, in the light of the express comparison which the judge drew between this case and that of Goring and Hockenhull and the fact that the minimum terms imposed on them have been reduced, there would be an understandable perception of unfairness if these sentences were not reduced also. For that reason and for that reason alone, we are persuaded that it is appropriate in this case to reduce the sentences slightly. 23.1. We therefore give leave in each case to appeal against sentence, and indicate that we would reduce the sentence on each applicant from 22 years' to 20 years' imprisonment.

After Brett Blake's funeral on 4 July 2008 Liversidge and Leyton Blake went to a wake at a public house. At about 1.00 am they and others left in a car driven by a man called Stefan Gordon. One of the occupants of that car, Wesley Daswell, later told the police that Leyton Blake wanted to find Nelson because he believed, albeit wrongly, that he had been responsible for his brother's death. 6.1. Liversidge and Daswell saw Nelson and Thompson in a car being driven by Nelson. They swerved in front of the car in an attempt to make it stop, but at that point Nelson was able to avoid them. Shortly afterwards, Liversidge and Daswell found Nelson and Thompson again in their car, but they ran away and made their escape. Liversidge and Daswell then made off with the car, which was later found burnt out. 7.1. Nelson and Thompson set out to exact revenge on Liversidge and Daswell, whom they found in Gordon's car parked outside a hotel. They repeatedly stabbed Liversidge, causing life threatening injuries. Those injuries included wounds to the right mid-upper arm, to the left armpit, to the right side of the chest and the right side of the back. As a result, both of his lungs partially collapsed and the blood supply to the liver and bowel was disrupted. 8.1. Liversidge was taken to hospital. During four hours of surgery he required 28 pints of blood. He suffered a blocked bile duct and needed a further operation. The medical evidence suggested that he would require another operation in the near future and may require surgery at intervals for the rest of his life. The doctors said that it was rare to see an injury of that nature where the patient did not bleed to death prior to surgical intervention. This was the attack which formed the basis for count 2 of the indictment which charged the applicants with attempted murder. 9.1. In the course of the attack Wesley Daswell was also stabbed, sustaining a single wound to his leg which required three stitches. That formed the basis for count 4 of the indictment, on which Thompson was convicted and Nelson acquitted. 10.1. On 19 July 2008 Nelson was arrested and on 7 November 2008 Thompson handed himself in to the police. Neither of them answered any questions in interview. 11.1. When passing sentence the judge noted that the offences were linked to the murder of Brett Blake, of which Danny Hockenhull and Curtis Goring had been convicted and sentenced some six weeks earlier. In their case the judge had passed mandatory life sentences with a direction that they each serve a minimum of 21 years in custody. That minimum period has now been reduced by this court to 18 years in each case. 12.1. In the course of his sentencing remarks the judge commented on the similarities in terms of age and background of these applicants with those of Hockenhull and Goring. The judge had the circumstances of that case and the level of sentencing very much in mind, as he made clear. He noted that there had been an element of provocation as far as Hockenhull had been concerned, which had taken the form of an attack only a few days earlier when Brett Blake had slashed his face with a knife. He took the view that there was no comparable provocation in this case, although Liversidge and others had chased the applicants and had taken and destroyed their car. He took the view that, in both cases, there had been an element of planning and revenge. 13.1. The judge noted that the case had its background in the break-up of a street gang. He observed that violence was escalating and that it was a serious aggravating feature that the murder of Brett Blake had itself been a spur to further violence. He said that gang violence, accompanied by a lack of co-operation with the police and a code of silence, even on the part of victims, was an escalating problem in all large cities, to which Sheffield was no exception. He considered that where determinate sentences are imposed for offences committed in that context, it is necessary that they should contain an element of deterrence to demonstrate that society will not tolerate that type of culture and its associated violence. He therefore passed a sentence which he made quite clear was deliberately intended to be severe. 14.1. The grounds of appeal in each case are that the sentence was manifestly excessive, and that, unless the sentences passed in the present case are reduced to some extent, there will be an apparent element of disparity between this case and the cases of Hockenhull and Goring. 15.1. The applicants in this case are still quite young. Thompson was born on 12 April 1983. He has seven previous convictions for 12 offences, which include possessing an offensive weapon, having a bladed article in a public place, robbery, affray and common assault. Nelson was born on 9 June 1982. He has six previous convictions for 14 offences, including one offence of robbery committed in January 2002. 16.1. Guidelines on sentencing for attempted murder have, since the date of these convictions, been published by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, and although they were not in force at the time when the judge passed sentence, we consider that they provide valuable assistance in relation to the appropriate sentences for offences of this kind, as counsel accepted. 17.1. The Guidelines identify different levels of seriousness of what is, on any view, a very serious offence. Level 2 relates to a planned attempt to kill, and in a case involving serious and long-term physical or psychological harm indicates a starting point of 20 years' imprisonment with a sentencing range of 17 to 25 years' imprisonment. The indication in relation to a Level 3 offence, which includes other spontaneous attempts to kill, is 15 years' custody as a starting point, and a range of 12 to 20 years' custody in a case involving serious and long-term physical or psychological harm. 18.1. Mr Reynolds submitted that this was properly to be regarded as a level 3 case because there was no significant planning involved. In our view, it is better viewed as a level 2 case, since there was, at least at some point, a plan to pursue the victims and to do so with an intention to kill Liversidge. It is not disputed that this is a case in which he suffered serious and long-term physical harm. 19.1. The fact that the offence resulted from an element of inter-gang rivalry is, in our view, a serious aggravating factor and the judge was entitled to take the view that the sentence should therefore contain an element of deterrence. As we have already indicated, the starting point for a level 2 offence is 20 years' imprisonment, with a range of 17 to 25 years. 20.1. There are some mitigating features to the case. Mr Reynolds has reminded us that, at an earlier time during that day, Nelson was doing his best to avoid arousing hostile feelings that were liable to be generated by the funeral, and, in addition, that both these applicants are, as we have indicated, relatively young men. 21.1. In the ordinary way we do not think that the sentence passed by the judge could be described as manifestly excessive having regard to the nature and the circumstances of the offence. This was a revenge attack in the context of inter-gang rivalry, and called for a severe sentence. 22.1. Nonetheless, we are persuaded that, in the light of the express comparison which the judge drew between this case and that of Goring and Hockenhull and the fact that the minimum terms imposed on them have been reduced, there would be an understandable perception of unfairness if these sentences were not reduced also. For that reason and for that reason alone, we are persuaded that it is appropriate in this case to reduce the sentences slightly. 23.1. We therefore give leave in each case to appeal against sentence, and indicate that we would reduce the sentence on each applicant from 22 years' to 20 years' imprisonment."

MR N RASIAH KC appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © MR JUSTICE GOOSE: On 31 May 2024, in the Crown Court at Wood Green, the applicant, Leon Murray, who was then aged 35, was convicted of Murder. He had previously entered a guilty plea to the lesser alternative of Manslaughter on 8 May 2024, which had not been accepted by the prosecution. On 3 June 2024, HHJ John Dodd KC, who was the trial judge, sentenced the applicant to Imprisonment for Life, with a minimum term under section 322 of the Sentencing Act 2020, of 20 years less 578 days served on remand. The judge imposed No Separate Penalty in respect of the Manslaughter. We shall return to that disposal later. The applicant's leave to appeal application in respect of his sentence was refused by the single judge and is now renewed before this Court. The facts of this murder may be stated concisely for the purposes of this renewed application. The applicant and the deceased had been in a long-term relationship over 13 years, having had three children together. Towards the end of the relationship the deceased had made it clear that she wished to end it but on previous occasions when she had said this they had been reconciled. On 31 October, the deceased told the applicant for the final time that the relationship was over. During that night the applicant held long telephone conversation with his half-sister during which he had informed her of his intention to kill the deceased. Attempts to dissuade him were unsuccessful and the call made to the deceased by the sister did not persuade her of the risk to her life. On 1 November, the applicant went to the home of the deceased which they had shared with the children. The older two children were elsewhere but the youngest was in a cot in the bedroom. The applicant had arranged with the deceased that he would attend the home in order to recover his belongings. Whilst inside the home an argument developed. The applicant picked up a kitchen knife which he used to stab the deceased 17 times. There was evidence of defensive wounds on the deceased indicating that there was a struggle. She bled to death in the sitting room whilst the youngest child was in that bedroom. After killing the deceased, the applicant changed out of his bloodstained clothes and took the baby to the school where one of the other children was being cared for. He called the eldest child and directed him away from the home. The applicant himself called the emergency services and reported that he had killed the deceased. After arrest he gave ""no comment"" in interview. Shortly before the trial the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter as a lesser alternative to the charge of murder. It was the applicant's case that he had been the subject of an attack or threat by the deceased, who had picked up a kitchen knife and had taunted him whilst he acted with a mental disorder sufficient to diminish his responsibility for the killing. He called medical evidence in support of a partial defence. The prosecution also called medical evidence to rebut the contention of diminished responsibility. The Jury convicted the applicant of murder rejecting his evidence and the partial defence. In sentencing the applicant, the judge concluded that the Starting Point for the minimum term for custody, to be served with a sentence of imprisonment for life was 15 years. The offence was aggravated in its seriousness by the fact that it was within the family home of the deceased, in a domestic context, there was evidence of planning or premeditation from conversation he had with his sister. This was a sustained attack with a knife involving 17 wounds. The presence of the very young child which, at the very least, would have increased the distress suffered by the deceased during the attack. When the judge considered the mitigating factors, taking into account that the applicant was effectively of good character, the judge concluded that there was little, if any evidence of genuine remorse, reducing the significance of this factor. The judge considered carefully the evidence heard during the trial, concerning the applicant's established complex PTSD, being the result of significant sexual abuse he had suffered when he was a child. The judge took into account the relevant guidelines, including sentencing offenders with mental disorders, development disorders or neurological impairments. The judge was required to assess whether the applicant's complex PTSD with traits of autism formed a sufficient connection between his offending and his mental disability. The judge stated: ""I am satisfied that your decision to kill her had nothing to do with any of the challenges that you have faced in your life as a result of the abuse you received as a child. Nor had your decision anything to do with any of your behavioural traits... I have given the significance of your mental health careful thought. Having done that, I consider that the seriousness of your offence is not mitigated by the presence of certain mental health issues in your life, and certainly those matters in my judgment do not reduce the seriousness of your offence."" Further, the judge accepted the applicant had indicated earlier in the proceedings that he accepted causing the death of the deceased. However, it was observed that he had given an account of the deceased's attack upon him which had been rejected by the jury as had his partial defence of diminished responsibility. The judge then imposed a 20-year minimum term for the murder conviction less time served on remand. The grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of the applicant are that the judge failed to take into account sufficiently or at all the applicant's mental health disability, his earlier admission of the killing and his effectively good character in order to mitigate the minimum term below that which was imposed. On behalf of the applicant Mr Kivdeh, for whose submissions we are grateful, argues that there was strong mitigation available to the applicant. He was a good father to the three children, his killing was out of character, he had not been violent within the relationship previously, he had traits of autism together with complex PTSD which might offer some explanation for this offence. Further, Mr Kivdeh also argues that there was no evidence of significant premeditation for this murder. In the Respondent's Note the prosecution submit that the judge was well placed to assess the medical evidence and its effect upon sentence. Having listened to the evidence during the course of the trial, which included oral evidence from the respective expert witnesses for both the prosecution and the defence. The conclusion drawn by the judge that the applicant's mental disability was not relevant to the offending was a decision which was open to the judge to make on the evidence that he heard. The prosecution submit that the minimum term imposed given the aggravating features of seriousness, whilst balanced to a limited extent to those mitigated was well within the reasonable range of sentencing. Mr Rasiah KC confirmed those submissions by his presence today. We have considered the merits of this renewed application for ourselves and have come to the same conclusion as the Single Judge. That the decision made on the evidence was open to the judge and cannot be criticised as either wrong or unreasonable. This was a serious and violent attack upon the applicant's partner involving 17 wounds with the use of a knife. The aggravating factors of seriousness included clear evidence of significant premeditation, and merited a substantial increase from the starting point of 15 years. Those factors mitigated were of much less weight. The conclusion of the judge that the minimum term must be 20 years before allowing for time served on remand cannot be faulted. The appeal against sentence is not, in our judgment, arguable and leave must be refused. Finally, we are invited to correct the disposal for Count 2 manslaughter in respect of which the Registrar has alerted the parties and the Court to an error made. The appropriate disposal should not have been no separate penalty but for the offence of manslaughter to lie on the file on the usual terms. Authority for this can be found in the decision of this Court in R v Butler [2023] EWCA Crim 676 . Accordingly, we quash the disposal of no separate penalty and in its place direct that Count 2 shall lie on the file not to be proceeded with without leave of this Court. The sentence on Count 1 (murder) remains Imprisonment for Life with a minimum term of 20 years less 578 days served on remand which is 18 years and 152 days. Save to that extent, this renewed application for leave to appeal sentence is refused.

JUSTICE KILNER BROWN ____________________ R E G I N A v. ANTONIO BECERRA and JOHN DAVID COOPER ____________________ MR. P. OWEN, Q.C. and MR. G. JONES appeared on behalf of the Applicant Becerra. MR. D.A. EVANS appeared on behalf of the Applicant Cooper. MR. W.T. WILLIAMS, Q.C. and MR. K. THOMAS appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © ( As approved by Judge ) LORD JUSTICE ROSKILL : There are before the Court two applications for leave to appeal against conviction for murder at Swansea Crown Court on 4th November last year after a long trial before Mr. Justice Mars Jones and a jury. The two applicants, both young men, named Cooper and Becerra, were indicted on an indictment which contained a number of counts, that large number being necessary to cover the enormity of the offences with which they were charged. A third man was charged with them. He was not however charged with murder. He was sentenced for his part in the less serious crimes of which these two men were also guilty, and nothing now turns upon his part. There were four counts, which are relevant to the present applications. The first which concerns these applicants alone is one of murder, the victim being a man called Lewis. The second was of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to 81-year old lady called Mrs. Francis. The third was of aggravated burglary and the fourth was of burglary. On the convictions other than the conviction for murder, the learned Judge passed sentences of five years imprisonment concurrent on that count relating to the attack on Mrs. Francis, seven years imprisonment concurrent for the aggravated burglary and three years imprisonment concurrent for the burglary. I should mention that Cooper pleaded guilty to that last count early in the trial, but was convicted by the jury on the first three counts. Becerra changed his plea on that last count on 24th November, after being put in charge of the jury, and subsequently, like Cooper, was convicted on the first three counts. The facts are horrifying, for they reveal acts of brutality almost unequalled even in this day and age. On 13th June 1974, in the early hours of the morning, these applicants and the third man entered this old lady's house at 8 Gore Terrace, Swansea, intending to steal some money that they had been told, as a result of a conversation in a public house, she kept in a drawer in her kitchen. It was said - whether truthfully or not does not matter - she might have as much as £4,000 there. When they entered this house through the old lady's bedroom window, the applicant Becerra was carrying a clasp knife which had, according to undisputed evidence, a handle 4½ inches long and a blade 3½ inches long; and once that knife blade was opened, it remained rigid until a lever on the handle was released. The evidence was beyond question that Cooper knew that Becerra had that knife, and indeed Cooper borrowed it to cut the telephone wires leading to the house. It is not necessary to go through the details, but some of the story must be related. Cooper climbed in through the window. The old lady began to switch her bedside light on and off. Cooper went over to her. He punched her, knelt and jumped on her, and covered her head with a pillow. Becerra and the third man followed Cooper. On Cooper's instructions the third man, somewhat reluctantly, took over the holding of the pillow over the old lady's face and Becerra cut the wires of the telephone by the side of the bed with the knife I have already mentioned. Cooper then took Becerra's knife in his left hand and went out into the hall, going towards the kitchen. Why he took that knife and why he was given that knife was a matter of acute controversy at the trial. Mr. Lewis, who was the occupier of a first floor flat in the house came downstairs, obviously having been aroused by what he heard was going on. Becerra and the third man heard him, climbed out of the window and ran away. Cooper tried the back door, but it was locked and so he turned back and was confronted by Lewis. There was a struggle in which beyond question Lewis was stabbed four times on the left hand side of his body and one of the stab wounds was 3½ inches deep and penetrated the right ventricle of his heart and he died. Cooper then made his escape through the window leaving the knife behind. Only by the mercy of providence was the old lady - not killed by the brutal treatment which she received. But she was greatly shocked and an innocent tenant of this house lost his life. Mrs. Francis herself was in such a state of shock that she was unable to speak and the medical evidence showed she had bruising on her chest and face. Mercifully there was no damage to her central nervous system. The basic prosecution case against Becerra and Cooper was that they had entered into a common agreement to use such force as was necessary against anyone in the house to get the money or to avoid identification or arrest. It was urged that this common agreement included the use, if necessary, of the knife to inflict serious bodily injury, if not death, and it was alleged that Cooper, in furtherance of that common agreement, murdered Lewis with the knife in his left hand while he pinioned Lewis from behind with his right arm around Lewis's shoulder. It is now necessary to say a word about how the knife came into Cooper's hand. It is beyond question that Cooper murdered Lewis. Some time afterwards, on 19th June, Becerra was involved in a motor accident; that is six days after the murder. He was taken to hospital in the early hours of the morning. Some eighteen hours later, just after 8.10 in the evening of 19th June, with the full consent of the experienced physician, who had charge of his case, the police interviewed him. Becerra then told the police that Cooper had said to him, just before Lewis was murdered and just before Becerra and the third man got out, ""Give me the knife in case somebody jumps me"". That obviously meant, if it was said, ""Give me the knife in case anybody ""comes who could identify me"". This was emphatically denied by Cooper and by Becerra. Cooper said the knife had been handed to him in order to enable him, Cooper, to open the drawer. Becerra said the knife had been handed to Cooper to enable Cooper to open the bedroom door. So there was this straight issue of fact to be determined by the jury, whether or not those words had been used, and if so, what did they mean. The learned Judge in a very full, clear and careful summing-up, stated the law regarding common design at the bottom of page 205 and the top of page 206 of the transcript. He dealt with the case of Cooper and he then went on to deal with the case of Becerra: ""The case against Becerra is based upon the proposition that he and Cooper were acting together in pursuance of a common agreement - namely to kill or to inflict really serious injury, if the need should arise to avoid detection or arrest; to make good their escape, if they were detected while in the house, without being seen. Now when, Members of the Jury, two or more people make such an agreement, one may play an active role whereas the other may play a passive role: merely of lending support by his presence, or keeping a look-out, or the like. But once an agreement of that kind is made, the act of one becomes the act of the other, if that act is done in pursuit of a common design. Although it was Cooper who wielded the knife, Becerra is equally responsible for the consequence of Cooper's actions if he supplied the knife for the purpose of causing death or really serious injury - not necessarily in any event, but if it became necessary to do so to avoid identification or apprehension."" I will pause there for one moment. Leaving aside for the moment what one might call the original common design, the crucial question which the jury had to decide was, what was the purpose of Becerra passing that knife to Cooper immediately before Lewis met his death at the hands of Cooper; and also, in connection with that issue, to make up their minds whether they accepted as true the police evidence of what Becerra had said to them at the hospital. The learned Judge reminded the jury that Becerra had suffered from concussion as a result of his motor accident and that that was something to be taken into account both in considering whether Becerra said what was alleged, and whether, if he did, that which he said was in fact true. No court could find fault with the Judge's direction to the jury on that point. It cannot be gainsaid that the language in question (if used) was capable of giving rise to the clear inference that the common purpose underlying the passing of that deadly knife from the hand of Becerra to the hand of Cooper was so that if the necessity arose, the knife could be used for the purpose of inflicting serious injury, though not necessarily death, for the purpose of avoiding identification and subsequent arrest and punishment. Mr. Owen in his argument in this Court did not seek to say that those words were not capable of bearing that meaning. But he forcefully urged upon us, and this was his first argument on behalf of Becerra, that those words used in those circumstances were too slight a foundation on which the jury could base a conclusion of common intent such as I have mentioned, and that therefore any verdict of murder against the applicant founded upon that evidence was unsafe and unsatisfactory. With great respect to that argument, we think it is unsound. This was essentially a question for the jury. The well established principles of law, which needed no more elaborate direction than the Judge gave in the clearest possible terms, are beyond all question. The only question, and it was one for the jury, was whether or not that statement had been made, and if made, bore the meaning which the Crown alleged it did. If the jury were convinced that it was made and did bear that meaning, then, in the view of each member of this Court, the jury were entitled to reach the conclusion that there was the common design I have mentioned and accordingly convict Becerra along with Cooper of the murder of Lewis, even though it was not Becerra's hand that struck the fatal blow. Accordingly, the first ground upon which this application for leave to appeal is based, fails. The second ground of appeal requires more elaborate treatment. It was argued in the alternative on behalf of Becerra, that even if there were this common design, in other words even if the point I have just dealt with were decided adversely to Becerra, nonetheless Becerra had open to him a second line of defence, namely that - I hope I do Mr. Owen's argument on the second ground no injustice if I put it this way  whatever Cooper did immediately before and at the time of the killing of Lewis, Becerra had by then withdrawn from that common design and so should not be convicted of the murder of Lewis, even though the common design had previously been that which I have stated. The learned Judge dealt with this point on pages 206 and 207 as follows: ""The Prosecution say that is the only inference which can properly be drawn from the defendant Becerra's statement to the police and his actions that night. Mr. Glanville-Jones, in his final speech, submitted that even if you found that Becerra had agreed that Cooper should use his knife to inflict ""really serious injury if he were set upon by someone trying to apprehend him, you should take the view that he had repented of his decision and communicated that decision to Copper when he said, 'There's a bloke coming, let's go.' It is right to say, Members of the Jury, that Becerra never mentioned to the police that he used the expression 'Let's go'. It is also right to mention that neither Cooper nor Gwilliam appear to have heard him say, 'Let's go'. But even if he did, what did those words amount to? Putting it at its highest in favour of Becerra, it means that he was asking Cooper to abandon the burglarious venture and leave the house with him. Now, it is right that a man can withdraw from a criminal conspiracy or agreement, like any other agreement, and if he does so he can escape liability for acts done in pursuance of the conspiracy after he has withdrawn from it, but he must give clear warning to his partner or partners that he is doing so ..."". Pausing there, I did not understand Mr. Owen criticise this passage so far as I have read. The learned Judge went on: "".. and at least take all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the crime which he had agreed the others should commit. Applying that principle to the facts of this case, the sort of action which might release Becerra of responsibility would be an attempt to recover the knife from Cooper or giving the unfortunate Frederick Lewis a warning that there was a man at the bottom of the stairs armed with a knife, or possibly interposing his own body between that of Lewis and that of Cooper. But Becerra did none of those things. He who puts a knife which is capable of inflicting fatal injury into the hands of another for use as a weapon to kill or cause really serious injury if the need arises, cannot escape liability ""when that need arises by merely using such words as, 'Come on, let's go', and fleeing the scene. You may think that the situation here was that Cooper feared he had little chance of escaping certainly without an opportunity for Frederick Lewis, and possibly Mrs. Francis, to see what he looked like unless he used that knife. It was Becerra who gave him that knife which enabled him to do what he did to Frederick Lewis. So much for the law."" Mr. Owen says that in that passage which I have just read, the learned Judge in effect, though perhaps not in so many words, withdrew the defence of ""withdrawal"" from the jury, because the learned Judge was saying to the jury that the only evidence of Becerra's suggested ""withdrawal"" was the remark, if it were made, ""Come on let's go"", coupled with the fact of course that Becerra then went out through the window and ran away and that that could not in those circumstances amount to ""withdrawal"" and therefore was not available as a defence, even if they decided the issue of common design against Becerra. It is upon that passage in the summing-up that Mr. Owen has principally focussed his criticism. It is necessary, before dealing with that argument in more detail, to say a word or two about the relevant law. It is a curious fact, considering the number of times in which this point arises where two or more people are charged with criminal offences, particularly murder or manslaughter, how relatively little authority there is in this country upon the point. But the principle is undoubtedly of long standing. Perhaps it is best first stated in The Queen v. Saunders and Archer 2 Plowden 473 (in the eighteenth year of the first Queen Elizabeth, 1577) at pages 476 and 477, in a note by Plowden, thus: "".. for if I command one to kill J.S. and before the fact done I go to him and tell him that I have repented, and expressly charge him not to kill J.S. and he afterwards kills him, there I shall not be accessory to this murder, because I have countermanded my first command, which in all reason shall discharge me, for the malicious mind of the accessory ought to continue to do ill until the time of the act done, or else he shall not be charged; but if he had killed J.S. before the time of my discharge or countermand given, I should have been accessory to the death, notwithstanding my private repentance."" The next case to which I may usefully refer is some 250 years later, but over 150 years ago: Rex v. Edmeads and Others 3 Carrington & Paynes, 390, where there is a ruling of Baron Vaughn at a trial at Berkshire Assizes, upon an indictment charging Edmeads and others with unlawfully shooting at game keepers. At the end of his ruling the learned Baron said on the question of common intent, ""that is rather a question for the Jury; but still, on this evidence, it is quite clear what the common purpose was. They all draw up in lines, and point their guns at the game-keepers, and they are all giving their countenance and assistance to the one of them who actually fires the gun. If it could be shown that either of them separated himself from the rest, and showed distinctly that he would have no hand in what they were doing, the objection would have much weight in it."" I can go forward over 100 years. Mr. Owen (to whose juniors we are indebted for their research into the relevant Canadian and United States cases), referred us to several Canadian cases, to only one of which is it necessary to refer in detail;, a decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Rex v. Whitehouse (1941) 1 Western Weekly Reports 112. I need not read the headnote. The Court of Appeal held that the trial Judge concerned in that case, which was one of murder, had been guilty of misdirection in his direction to the jury on this question of ""withdrawal"". The matter is, if I may most respectfully say so, so well put in the leading judgment of Mr. Justice Sloan, that I read the whole of the passage at pages 115 and 116: ""Can it be said on the facts of this case that a mere change of mental intention and a quitting of the scene of the crime just immediately prior to the striking of the fatal blow will absolve those who participate in the commission of the crime by overt acts up to that moment from all the consequences of its accomplishment by the one who strikes in ignorance of his companions' change of heart? I think not. After a crime has been committed and before a prior abandonment of the common enterprise may be found by a jury there must be, in my view, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, something more than a mere mental change of intention and physical change of place by those associates who wish to dissociate themselves from the consequences attendant upon their willing assistance up to the moment of the actual commission of that crime. I would not attempt to define too closely what must be done in criminal matters involving participation in a common unlawful purpose to break the chain of causation and responsibility. That must depend upon the circumstances of each case but it seems to me that one essential element ought to be established in a case of this kind: Where practicable and reasonable there must be timely communication of the intention to abandon the common purpose from those who wish to dissociate themselves from the contemplated crime to those who desire to continue in it. What is 'timely communication' must be determined by the facts of each case but where practicable and reasonable it ought to be such communication, verbal or otherwise, that will serve unequivocal notice upon the other party to the common unlawful cause that if he proceeds upon it he does so without the further aid and assistance of those who withdraw. The unlawful purpose of him who continues alone is then his own and not one in common with those who are no longer parties to it nor liable to its full and final consequences."" The learned Judge then went on to cite a passage from Hale and the passage from The Queen v . Saunders and Archer to which I have already referred. In the view of each member of this Court, that passage, if we may respectfully say so, could not be improved upon and we venture to adopt it in its entirety as a correct statement of the law which is to be applied in this case. The last case, an English one, is Rex v. Croft , a well known case of a suicide pact, 1944 1 King's Bench 295, where, under the old law, the survivor of a suicide pact was charged with and convicted of murder. It was sought to argue that he had withdrawn from the pact in time to avoid liability (as the law then was) for conviction for murder. The Court of Criminal Appeal, comprising Mr. Justice Lawrence (as he then was), Mr. Justice Lewis and Mr. Justice Wrottesley, dismissed the appeal and upheld the direction given by Mr. Justice Humphreys to the jury at the trial. Towards the end of the judgment Mr. Justice Lawrence said, at pages 297 and 298: ""Counsel for the appellant also complains that the summing-up does not contain any reference to the possibility of the agreement to commit suicide having been determined. It is true that the learned judge does not deal expressly with that matter except in a passage where he says: 'Even if you accept his statement in the witness-box that the vital and second shot was fired when he had gone through that window, he would still be guilty of murder if she was then committing suicide as the result of an agreement which they had mutually arrived at that that should be the fate of both of them, and it is no answer for him that he altered his mind after she was dead and did not commit suicide himself.' The authorities, however, such as they are, show, in our opinion, that the appellant, to escape being held guilty as an accessory before the fact must establish that he expressly countermanded or revoked the advising, counselling, procuring, or abetting which he had previously given."" It seems to us that those authorities make plain what the law is which has to be applied in the present case. We therefore turn back to consider the direction which the learned Judge gave in the present case to the jury and what was the suggested evidence that Becerra had withdrawn from the common agreement. The suggested evidence is the use by Becerra of the words ""Come on let's go"", coupled, as I said a few moments ago, with his act in going out through the window. The evidence, as the Judge pointed out, was that Cooper never heard that nor did the third man. But let it be supposed that that was said and the jury took the view that it was said. On the facts of this case, in the circumstances then prevailing, the knife having already been used and being contemplated for further use when it was handed over by Becerra to Cooper for the purpose (if necessary) of avoiding by violent means the hazards of identification, if Becerra wanted to withdraw at that stage, he would have to ""countermand"", to use the word that is used in some of the cases or ""repent"" to use another word so used, in some manner vastly different and vastly more effective than merely to say ""Come on, let's go"" and go out through the window. It is not necessary, on this application, to decide whether the point of time had arrived at which the only way in which he could effectively withdraw, so as to free himself from joint responsibility for any act Cooper thereafter did in furtherance of the common design, would be physically to intervene so as to stop Cooper attacking Lewis, as the Judge suggested, by interposing his own body between them or somehow getting in between them or whether some other action might suffice. That does not arise for decision here. Nor is it necessary to decide whether or not the learned Judge was right or wrong, on the facts of this case, in that passage which appears at the bottom of page 206, which Mr. Owen criticised: ""and at least take all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the crime which had agreed the others should commit."" It is enough for the purposes of deciding this application to say that under the law of this country as it stands, and on the facts (taking them at their highest in favour of Becerra), that which was urged as amounting to withdrawal from the common design was not capable of amounting to such withdrawal. Accordingly Becerra remains responsible, in the eyes of the law, for everything that Cooper did and continued to do after Becerra's disappearance through the window as much as if he had done them himself. Cooper being unquestionably guilty of murder, Becerra is equally guilty of murder. Mr. Owen's careful argument must therefore be rejected and the application by Becerra for leave to appeal against conviction fails. I have so far said nothing about Cooper's application. At the end of the trial the matter was properly considered by the experienced counsel by whom Cooper had had the advantage of being represented, Mr. Myerson, Q.C. and Mr. Evans. Immediately after the trial and before, as we understand it, they had seen the transcript, they had formed the view that there were no arguable grounds of appeal for Cooper. When the matter was again formally put before them, they again expressed that view, and they notified the Registrar that that was the view they took. Having read the summing-up and the evidence, this Court is without hesitation of the opinion that they were right in that view. There were no arguable grounds of appeal. Cooper was of course told that that advice had been given. But, as he was fully entitled, he persisted in his application. Legal aid was given to Mr. Evans to come here for the purpose of explaining the position to the Court, for which we are obliged. We went through, with him, Cooper's own grounds of appeal which he had written out himself. It is plain that all those grounds, as Mr. Evans said this morning, are, if I may use lawyers' shorthand, all jury points, that is to say, he seeks to go behind the adverse verdict of the jury on the issues of fact which were before them. This was a very serious case, resulting in a conviction of a young man for murder. We have gone through these grounds with the utmost care to make certain that there are no arguable grounds and, as I have already stated, we find none. Therefore, for the reasons I have given and as we indicated before Mr. Evans left, there is no possible reason for giving Cooper leave to appeal and his application is likewise refused.

D.A. EVANS appeared on behalf of the Applicant Cooper. MR. W.T. WILLIAMS, Q.C. and MR. K. THOMAS appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ ____________________ ( As approved by Judge ) LORD JUSTICE ROSKILL : There are before the Court two applications for leave to appeal against conviction for murder at Swansea Crown Court on 4th November last year after a long trial before Mr. Justice Mars Jones and a jury. The two applicants, both young men, named Cooper and Becerra, were indicted on an indictment which contained a number of counts, that large number being necessary to cover the enormity of the offences with which they were charged. A third man was charged with them. He was not however charged with murder. He was sentenced for his part in the less serious crimes of which these two men were also guilty, and nothing now turns upon his part. There were four counts, which are relevant to the present applications. The first which concerns these applicants alone is one of murder, the victim being a man called Lewis. The second was of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to 81-year old lady called Mrs. Francis. The third was of aggravated burglary and the fourth was of burglary. On the convictions other than the conviction for murder, the learned Judge passed sentences of five years imprisonment concurrent on that count relating to the attack on Mrs. Francis, seven years imprisonment concurrent for the aggravated burglary and three years imprisonment concurrent for the burglary. I should mention that Cooper pleaded guilty to that last count early in the trial, but was convicted by the jury on the first three counts. Becerra changed his plea on that last count on 24th November, after being put in charge of the jury, and subsequently, like Cooper, was convicted on the first three counts. The facts are horrifying, for they reveal acts of brutality almost unequalled even in this day and age. On 13th June 1974, in the early hours of the morning, these applicants and the third man entered this old lady's house at 8 Gore Terrace, Swansea, intending to steal some money that they had been told, as a result of a conversation in a public house, she kept in a drawer in her kitchen. It was said - whether truthfully or not does not matter - she might have as much as £4,000 there. When they entered this house through the old lady's bedroom window, the applicant Becerra was carrying a clasp knife which had, according to undisputed evidence, a handle 4½ inches long and a blade 3½ inches long; and once that knife blade was opened, it remained rigid until a lever on the handle was released. The evidence was beyond question that Cooper knew that Becerra had that knife, and indeed Cooper borrowed it to cut the telephone wires leading to the house. It is not necessary to go through the details, but some of the story must be related. Cooper climbed in through the window. The old lady began to switch her bedside light on and off. Cooper went over to her. He punched her, knelt and jumped on her, and covered her head with a pillow. Becerra and the third man followed Cooper. On Cooper's instructions the third man, somewhat reluctantly, took over the holding of the pillow over the old lady's face and Becerra cut the wires of the telephone by the side of the bed with the knife I have already mentioned. Cooper then took Becerra's knife in his left hand and went out into the hall, going towards the kitchen. Why he took that knife and why he was given that knife was a matter of acute controversy at the trial. Mr. Lewis, who was the occupier of a first floor flat in the house came downstairs, obviously having been aroused by what he heard was going on. Becerra and the third man heard him, climbed out of the window and ran away. Cooper tried the back door, but it was locked and so he turned back and was confronted by Lewis. There was a struggle in which beyond question Lewis was stabbed four times on the left hand side of his body and one of the stab wounds was 3½ inches deep and penetrated the right ventricle of his heart and he died. Cooper then made his escape through the window leaving the knife behind. Only by the mercy of providence was the old lady - not killed by the brutal treatment which she received. But she was greatly shocked and an innocent tenant of this house lost his life. Mrs. Francis herself was in such a state of shock that she was unable to speak and the medical evidence showed she had bruising on her chest and face. Mercifully there was no damage to her central nervous system. The basic prosecution case against Becerra and Cooper was that they had entered into a common agreement to use such force as was necessary against anyone in the house to get the money or to avoid identification or arrest. It was urged that this common agreement included the use, if necessary, of the knife to inflict serious bodily injury, if not death, and it was alleged that Cooper, in furtherance of that common agreement, murdered Lewis with the knife in his left hand while he pinioned Lewis from behind with his right arm around Lewis's shoulder. It is now necessary to say a word about how the knife came into Cooper's hand. It is beyond question that Cooper murdered Lewis. Some time afterwards, on 19th June, Becerra was involved in a motor accident; that is six days after the murder. He was taken to hospital in the early hours of the morning. Some eighteen hours later, just after 8.10 in the evening of 19th June, with the full consent of the experienced physician, who had charge of his case, the police interviewed him. Becerra then told the police that Cooper had said to him, just before Lewis was murdered and just before Becerra and the third man got out, ""Give me the knife in case somebody jumps me"". That obviously meant, if it was said, ""Give me the knife in case anybody ""comes who could identify me"". This was emphatically denied by Cooper and by Becerra. Cooper said the knife had been handed to him in order to enable him, Cooper, to open the drawer. Becerra said the knife had been handed to Cooper to enable Cooper to open the bedroom door. So there was this straight issue of fact to be determined by the jury, whether or not those words had been used, and if so, what did they mean. The learned Judge in a very full, clear and careful summing-up, stated the law regarding common design at the bottom of page 205 and the top of page 206 of the transcript. He dealt with the case of Cooper and he then went on to deal with the case of Becerra: ""The case against Becerra is based upon the proposition that he and Cooper were acting together in pursuance of a common agreement - namely to kill or to inflict really serious injury, if the need should arise to avoid detection or arrest; to make good their escape, if they were detected while in the house, without being seen. Now when, Members of the Jury, two or more people make such an agreement, one may play an active role whereas the other may play a passive role: merely of lending support by his presence, or keeping a look-out, or the like. But once an agreement of that kind is made, the act of one becomes the act of the other, if that act is done in pursuit of a common design. Although it was Cooper who wielded the knife, Becerra is equally responsible for the consequence of Cooper's actions if he supplied the knife for the purpose of causing death or really serious injury - not necessarily in any event, but if it became necessary to do so to avoid identification or apprehension."" I will pause there for one moment. Leaving aside for the moment what one might call the original common design, the crucial question which the jury had to decide was, what was the purpose of Becerra passing that knife to Cooper immediately before Lewis met his death at the hands of Cooper; and also, in connection with that issue, to make up their minds whether they accepted as true the police evidence of what Becerra had said to them at the hospital. The learned Judge reminded the jury that Becerra had suffered from concussion as a result of his motor accident and that that was something to be taken into account both in considering whether Becerra said what was alleged, and whether, if he did, that which he said was in fact true. No court could find fault with the Judge's direction to the jury on that point. It cannot be gainsaid that the language in question (if used) was capable of giving rise to the clear inference that the common purpose underlying the passing of that deadly knife from the hand of Becerra to the hand of Cooper was so that if the necessity arose, the knife could be used for the purpose of inflicting serious injury, though not necessarily death, for the purpose of avoiding identification and subsequent arrest and punishment. Mr. Owen in his argument in this Court did not seek to say that those words were not capable of bearing that meaning. But he forcefully urged upon us, and this was his first argument on behalf of Becerra, that those words used in those circumstances were too slight a foundation on which the jury could base a conclusion of common intent such as I have mentioned, and that therefore any verdict of murder against the applicant founded upon that evidence was unsafe and unsatisfactory. With great respect to that argument, we think it is unsound. This was essentially a question for the jury. The well established principles of law, which needed no more elaborate direction than the Judge gave in the clearest possible terms, are beyond all question. The only question, and it was one for the jury, was whether or not that statement had been made, and if made, bore the meaning which the Crown alleged it did. If the jury were convinced that it was made and did bear that meaning, then, in the view of each member of this Court, the jury were entitled to reach the conclusion that there was the common design I have mentioned and accordingly convict Becerra along with Cooper of the murder of Lewis, even though it was not Becerra's hand that struck the fatal blow. Accordingly, the first ground upon which this application for leave to appeal is based, fails. The second ground of appeal requires more elaborate treatment. It was argued in the alternative on behalf of Becerra, that even if there were this common design, in other words even if the point I have just dealt with were decided adversely to Becerra, nonetheless Becerra had open to him a second line of defence, namely that - I hope I do Mr. Owen's argument on the second ground no injustice if I put it this way  whatever Cooper did immediately before and at the time of the killing of Lewis, Becerra had by then withdrawn from that common design and so should not be convicted of the murder of Lewis, even though the common design had previously been that which I have stated. The learned Judge dealt with this point on pages 206 and 207 as follows: ""The Prosecution say that is the only inference which can properly be drawn from the defendant Becerra's statement to the police and his actions that night. Mr. Glanville-Jones, in his final speech, submitted that even if you found that Becerra had agreed that Cooper should use his knife to inflict ""really serious injury if he were set upon by someone trying to apprehend him, you should take the view that he had repented of his decision and communicated that decision to Copper when he said, 'There's a bloke coming, let's go.' It is right to say, Members of the Jury, that Becerra never mentioned to the police that he used the expression 'Let's go'. It is also right to mention that neither Cooper nor Gwilliam appear to have heard him say, 'Let's go'. But even if he did, what did those words amount to? Putting it at its highest in favour of Becerra, it means that he was asking Cooper to abandon the burglarious venture and leave the house with him. Now, it is right that a man can withdraw from a criminal conspiracy or agreement, like any other agreement, and if he does so he can escape liability for acts done in pursuance of the conspiracy after he has withdrawn from it, but he must give clear warning to his partner or partners that he is doing so ..."". Pausing there, I did not understand Mr. Owen criticise this passage so far as I have read. The learned Judge went on: "".. and at least take all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the crime which he had agreed the others should commit. Applying that principle to the facts of this case, the sort of action which might release Becerra of responsibility would be an attempt to recover the knife from Cooper or giving the unfortunate Frederick Lewis a warning that there was a man at the bottom of the stairs armed with a knife, or possibly interposing his own body between that of Lewis and that of Cooper.

It is a curious fact, considering the number of times in which this point arises where two or more people are charged with criminal offences, particularly murder or manslaughter, how relatively little authority there is in this country upon the point.

Saunders and Archer 2 Plowden 473 (in the eighteenth year of the first Queen Elizabeth, 1577) at pages 476 and 477, in a note by Plowden, thus: "".. for if I command one to kill J.S. and before the fact done I go to him and tell him that I have repented, and expressly charge him not to kill J.S. and he afterwards kills him, there I shall not be accessory to this murder, because I have countermanded my first command, which in all reason shall discharge me, for the malicious mind of the accessory ought to continue to do ill until the time of the act done, or else he shall not be charged; but if he had killed J.S. before the time of my discharge or countermand given, I should have been accessory to the death, notwithstanding my private repentance."" The next case to which I may usefully refer is some 250 years later, but over 150 years ago: Rex v.

If it could be shown that either of them separated himself from the rest, and showed distinctly that he would have no hand in what they were doing, the objection would have much weight in it."" I can go forward over 100 years. Mr. Owen (to whose juniors we are indebted for their research into the relevant Canadian and United States cases), referred us to several Canadian cases, to only one of which is it necessary to refer in detail;, a decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Rex v. Whitehouse (1941) 1 Western Weekly Reports 112. I need not read the headnote. The Court of Appeal held that the trial Judge concerned in that case, which was one of murder, had been guilty of misdirection in his direction to the jury on this question of ""withdrawal"". The matter is, if I may most respectfully say so, so well put in the leading judgment of Mr. Justice Sloan, that I read the whole of the passage at pages 115 and 116: ""Can it be said on the facts of this case that a mere change of mental intention and a quitting of the scene of the crime just immediately prior to the striking of the fatal blow will absolve those who participate in the commission of the crime by overt acts up to that moment from all the consequences of its accomplishment by the one who strikes in ignorance of his companions' change of heart? I think not. After a crime has been committed and before a prior abandonment of the common enterprise may be found by a jury there must be, in my view, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, something more than a mere mental change of intention and physical change of place by those associates who wish to dissociate themselves from the consequences attendant upon their willing assistance up to the moment of the actual commission of that crime. I would not attempt to define too closely what must be done in criminal matters involving participation in a common unlawful purpose to break the chain of causation and responsibility. That must depend upon the circumstances of each case but it seems to me that one essential element ought to be established in a case of this kind: Where practicable and reasonable there must be timely communication of the intention to abandon the common purpose from those who wish to dissociate themselves from the contemplated crime to those who desire to continue in it. What is 'timely communication' must be determined by the facts of each case but where practicable and reasonable it ought to be such communication, verbal or otherwise, that will serve unequivocal notice upon the other party to the common unlawful cause that if he proceeds upon it he does so without the further aid and assistance of those who withdraw. The unlawful purpose of him who continues alone is then his own and not one in common with those who are no longer parties to it nor liable to its full and final consequences."" The learned Judge then went on to cite a passage from Hale and the passage from The Queen v . Saunders and Archer to which I have already referred. In the view of each member of this Court, that passage, if we may respectfully say so, could not be improved upon and we venture to adopt it in its entirety as a correct statement of the law which is to be applied in this case. The last case, an English one, is Rex v. Croft , a well known case of a suicide pact, 1944 1 King's Bench 295, where, under the old law, the survivor of a suicide pact was charged with and convicted of murder. It was sought to argue that he had withdrawn from the pact in time to avoid liability (as the law then was) for conviction for murder. The Court of Criminal Appeal, comprising Mr. Justice Lawrence (as he then was), Mr. Justice Lewis and Mr. Justice Wrottesley, dismissed the appeal and upheld the direction given by Mr. Justice Humphreys to the jury at the trial. Towards the end of the judgment Mr. Justice Lawrence said, at pages 297 and 298: ""Counsel for the appellant also complains that the summing-up does not contain any reference to the possibility of the agreement to commit suicide having been determined. It is true that the learned judge does not deal expressly with that matter except in a passage where he says: 'Even if you accept his statement in the witness-box that the vital and second shot was fired when he had gone through that window, he would still be guilty of murder if she was then committing suicide as the result of an agreement which they had mutually arrived at that that should be the fate of both of them, and it is no answer for him that he altered his mind after she was dead and did not commit suicide himself.' The authorities, however, such as they are, show, in our opinion, that the appellant, to escape being held guilty as an accessory before the fact must establish that he expressly countermanded or revoked the advising, counselling, procuring, or abetting which he had previously given."" It seems to us that those authorities make plain what the law is which has to be applied in the present case. We therefore turn back to consider the direction which the learned Judge gave in the present case to the jury and what was the suggested evidence that Becerra had withdrawn from the common agreement. The suggested evidence is the use by Becerra of the words ""Come on let's go"", coupled, as I said a few moments ago, with his act in going out through the window. The evidence, as the Judge pointed out, was that Cooper never heard that nor did the third man. But let it be supposed that that was said and the jury took the view that it was said. On the facts of this case, in the circumstances then prevailing, the knife having already been used and being contemplated for further use when it was handed over by Becerra to Cooper for the purpose (if necessary) of avoiding by violent means the hazards of identification, if Becerra wanted to withdraw at that stage, he would have to ""countermand"", to use the word that is used in some of the cases or ""repent"" to use another word so used, in some manner vastly different and vastly more effective than merely to say ""Come on, let's go"" and go out through the window. It is not necessary, on this application, to decide whether the point of time had arrived at which the only way in which he could effectively withdraw, so as to free himself from joint responsibility for any act Cooper thereafter did in furtherance of the common design, would be physically to intervene so as to stop Cooper attacking Lewis, as the Judge suggested, by interposing his own body between them or somehow getting in between them or whether some other action might suffice. That does not arise for decision here. Nor is it necessary to decide whether or not the learned Judge was right or wrong, on the facts of this case, in that passage which appears at the bottom of page 206, which Mr. Owen criticised: ""and at least take all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the crime which had agreed the others should commit."" It is enough for the purposes of deciding this application to say that under the law of this country as it stands, and on the facts (taking them at their highest in favour of Becerra), that which was urged as amounting to withdrawal from the common design was not capable of amounting to such withdrawal. Accordingly Becerra remains responsible, in the eyes of the law, for everything that Cooper did and continued to do after Becerra's disappearance through the window as much as if he had done them himself. Cooper being unquestionably guilty of murder, Becerra is equally guilty of murder. Mr. Owen's careful argument must therefore be rejected and the application by Becerra for leave to appeal against conviction fails. I have so far said nothing about Cooper's application. At the end of the trial the matter was properly considered by the experienced counsel by whom Cooper had had the advantage of being represented, Mr. Myerson, Q.C. and Mr. Evans. Immediately after the trial and before, as we understand it, they had seen the transcript, they had formed the view that there were no arguable grounds of appeal for Cooper. When the matter was again formally put before them, they again expressed that view, and they notified the Registrar that that was the view they took. Having read the summing-up and the evidence, this Court is without hesitation of the opinion that they were right in that view. There were no arguable grounds of appeal. Cooper was of course told that that advice had been given. But, as he was fully entitled, he persisted in his application. Legal aid was given to Mr. Evans to come here for the purpose of explaining the position to the Court, for which we are obliged. We went through, with him, Cooper's own grounds of appeal which he had written out himself. It is plain that all those grounds, as Mr. Evans said this morning, are, if I may use lawyers' shorthand, all jury points, that is to say, he seeks to go behind the adverse verdict of the jury on the issues of fact which were before them. This was a very serious case, resulting in a conviction of a young man for murder. We have gone through these grounds with the utmost care to make certain that there are no arguable grounds and, as I have already stated, we find none. Therefore, for the reasons I have given and as we indicated before Mr. Evans left, there is no possible reason for giving Cooper leave to appeal and his application is likewise refused. (The Court heard submissions on the concurrent sentences in the case of Becerral) LORD JUSTICE ROSKILL : We shall not interfere with the concurrent sentences."

The Applicant Ward did not appear and was not represented. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © LORD JUSTICE EDIS: Paula Usherwood is now 41, Carla McGuire is now 54 and Leonard Ward is now 44 years old. Each of them seeks leave to appeal against sentence following refusal by the single judge. Each of them was convicted of murder, following a lengthy trial, those verdicts being returned on 12 June 2023. The trial judge was Turner J. The sentencing exercise following those convictions and convictions of other co-defendants in the trial took place on 21 and 22 June 2023. Each of these applicants was inevitably sentenced to life imprisonment and the task of the judge was to specify the minimum term under section 322 of the Sentencing Act 2020. In each case the minimum term which was specified by the judge had deducted from it the days which had been spent on remand awaiting trial. The result was that the minimum term in Usherwood's case was fixed at 30 years' imprisonment less 575 days, in McGuire's case, the minimum term was 20 years' imprisonment less 574 days and in the case of Ward, the minimum term was 32 years less 569 days. The judge was required to pass sentence on a number of other people too. It is not necessary for the purpose of this judgment to identify the terms which were assessed in those cases but it is appropriate to observe that the judge was careful to make distinctions between the different defendants that he had to deal with, according to the findings of fact that he made about the nature of their involvement in this murder. The applications before us are renewed, as we have said. We have heard oral submissions on behalf of Usherwood from Mr Peter Joyce KC. We have heard oral submissions on behalf of McGuire from Mr Gary Bell KC. They both appear pro bono in conducting these applications, and the Court is extremely grateful to them for their submissions and for their appearance in those circumstances. It is not widely enough known that the Bar commonly appears without fee in this Court in order to argue applications for leave to appeal against sentence following refusal on the papers and that is a valuable public service which should be acknowledged. Ward is not represented before us but we do have the documents which were prepared on his behalf by his legal team and are therefore familiar with the points which may be made in his favour and we will deal with those in due course. It is necessary to set out the facts of the case in a little detail. It was a complex trial in which a large number of different defendants each denied their guilt of murder. It was the task of the jury to assess each case with care and to return verdicts. The prosecution case, which the jury accepted, was that this murder arose out of a commercial turf war between rival drug-dealing syndicates in Nottingham. That turf war was prosecuted by incidents of violence which culminated, for present purposes, in the stabbing to death of Michael Anton O'Connor on 10 November 2021 outside 121 Wilfred Crescent West, in The Meadows area of Nottingham. The prosecution alleged that he was killed because he walked into a trap which had been set for another man altogether named McKenzie. McKenzie was in the process of establishing a drug-dealing syndicate in the area where this killing occurred (The Meadows area of Nottingham). That territory for drug-dealing purposes was already occupied by another syndicate. It was alleged that Ward was a significant controlling member of that syndicate and that Usherwood was closely involved in it. McGuire's involvement was said to be less deep but nevertheless involved the provision of significant assistance to the plan which resulted in Mr O' Connor's death. In very short summary, the position was that at the end of October 2021 the syndicate led by Ward was becoming increasingly concerned by the intrusive and violent conduct of McKenzie's syndicate which was in the process of taking its business. That syndicate decided to respond to that by organising an attack on McKenzie. An agreement was reached that he would go to the area around No 121, where he would be trapped and then attacked by a gang who had come down from Manchester for that purpose. None of these applicants was part of the Manchester squad. The judge dealt with the case on the basis that it may not have been intended that McKenzie would be killed but it was certainly the case that he would suffer really serious injury. In the event, he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Manchester team called ""Mingoes"" and died at the scene. These three applicants were said to have been involved in planning this trap and to different degrees in implementing it. The reason O'Connor rather than McKenzie died was that McKenzie decided not to attend the meeting himself but to send Mr O' Connor along instead. Usherwood had been involved on the day of the attack, with another, in meeting McKenzie at Poet's Corner. The allegation was that that meeting was to make arrangements for him to attend a further meeting later that night, at which he would be ambushed and attacked by the Manchester team which would either kill him or cause him, at the least, really serious harm. Carla McGuire had installed CCTV cameras at No 121 on 14 October 2021, just a couple of weeks before this happened. That CCTV footage contained significant evidence showing the arrival of the hit team from Manchester and showing that team leaving the property on two occasions, which were said to be reconnaissance expeditions. On the second of those expeditions they used a set of untraceable bicycles and it was said that McGuire and Usherwood had both been involved in obtaining those. When the deceased arrived the CCTV was turned off by McGuire, so that it would not capture the attack. This was an important part of the case against her because the prosecution invited the jury to draw the inference that she must have known that there was going to be an attack. The CCTV was turned on again at a time when it captured some members of the Nottingham syndicate which had organised this attack attempting to administer CPR to the dead or dying O'Connor. No doubt it was thought that that footage might be helpful in strong contrast to the footage which McGuire had been careful to ensure would never come into existence of the attack itself. The manipulation of the CCTV cameras therefore at and around the time of the attack indicated a fairly detailed knowledge by her of what was to happen and of what had happened. The attack itself occurred when O'Connor arrived at the scene of the meeting. Usherwood was in a vehicle. She drove out of a road nearby sounding the vehicle's horn in order to attract the hit team. McGuire and others came out of No 121 at that point, and the crowd thereby formed prevented Mr O' Connor from escaping. Usherwood continued to manoeuvre her car around the area to obstruct his escape. The hit team then appeared. At this point O'Connor was trapped behind a car and was stabbed by Mingoes, causing his death. Afterwards steps were taken to get the Manchester team safely away and to remove and destroy clothing which had been worn. At this stage McGuire's involvement was limited to dealing with the CCTV in the way that we've have described. Usherwood though was actively involved in dealing with the Manchester team's escape and dealing with clothing and the destruction of a vehicle which had been used. Soon afterwards McKenzie and his associates made an attempt on Usherwood's life but the handgun which they had jammed. That, in a nutshell, is a description by way of summary of the facts giving rise to these convictions for murder. The judge had, when determining sentence, a thorough knowledge, far more extensive than our summary would suggest, of the facts of the case having presided over this very long case. He also had victim personal statements about the consequences of the death of O'Connor for those who loved him. So far as antecedents are concerned, Usherwood had eight convictions, most recently in 2008, including a conviction in December 2007 for supplying Class C drugs for which he had received a 12-month prison sentence. McGuire had only three previous convictions, none of which was of direct relevance and she had not previously been sent to prison. Ward had 20 convictions between 2000 and 2017, including a conviction in May 2012, for possession with intent to supply Class B drugs and possession of a firearm, for which he had been sent to prison for 5 years. His last conviction was in October 2017 for wounding, for which he received a custodial sentence of 20 months. The judge did not have pre-sentence reports, none being necessary in the circumstances of this case either then or now. In his sentencing remarks the judge found that the attack was deliberately planned and intended not only as a show of force but also a plan involving the actual use of force which would fall short of an intention to kill. He said he was not sure that there was an intention to kill given the proximity of this killing to No 121, which was an address occupied by McGuire and other members of the relevant syndicate. The dealing by McGuire of the CCTV occurred at the last minute and the arrangements for the retreat were also somewhat disorganised. So far as Ward was concerned, the judge found that he was a leading figure in the syndicate which was attempting to defend its turf and that he had played a leading role in instigating the plan. He was sentenced on the basis that he knew that the plan involved infliction of serious violence on, as was intended McKenzie but as it happened O'Connor, and that he was closely involved in monitoring events throughout the relevant day. The judge had to consider, of course, Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020 and to decide on the appropriate starting point. He concluded in the circumstances of this case that this was an offence of murder for gain attracting the 30-year starting point. There were in the case of Ward aggravating features involving his leading role and careful planning. He also had significant previous convictions and knew that the attackers from Manchester would be armed. The judge balanced those aggravating features against such mitigating features as there were and concluded that the minimum term should be higher than the starting point and fixed it at 32 years. In the case of McGuire, the judge found that she knew that her house (No 121) was being used as the operational base of the drug dealing syndicate. She was aware that that business was under threat because of the new rival on the block (McKenzie), so she knew why the hit team were at her property on the day of the murder. The judge found that she shared in the common intention in relation to the attack. She had dealt with the CCTV in the way that we have described at the request of her son, who was another member of this syndicate, and then had attempted to cover it up. The judge concluded that in her case this was not a murder for gain; she had been motivated by a desire to protect her own safety and also out of misguided loyalty to her family. He was satisfied that she knew that weapons would be used and therefore the appropriate starting point from Schedule 21 was 25 years. The judge considered the aggravating features, namely the level of planning that was involved and weighed against those the mitigating features. The mitigation was primarily to be derived from her lesser involvement in the plan than others and her motivation which was different from that of others. That motivation of course had already operated to reduce the starting point in her case from 30 years to 25 years and therefore had limited further traction at that stage. The judge balancing mitigation against aggravating features made a downward adjustment from the starting point in her case to 20 years. In the case of Usherwood, the judge found that she was closely affiliated with Ward's syndicate operating in The Meadows area of Nottingham. Mr Joyce on her behalf has described her behaviour during the trial as abrasive, difficult and uncontrolled. The judge concluded that she was a person who was aggressively assertive. Mr Joyce has submitted that given that irrational and uncontrolled behaviour, she would be the last person that any sensible drug-dealing syndicate would trust with any significant part in its activities or any knowledge of them. The judge thought, and found, that actually her aggressive assertiveness had its uses from the point of view of a syndicate which was under attack and having to defend its turf in a power struggle. The judge found that she had been involved in the meeting with McKenzie which we have described, and that she had been involved in driving the hit team around and in the attack itself using her car in the way that we have described. In those circumstances, the judge found that in her case this was involvement in a plot which culminated in murder and that that plot was designed to secure the gain for her syndicate and that it was therefore in her case a murder for gain attracting the starting point of 30 years. In her case the judge weighted the mitigating features against the aggravating features and found that they cancelled each other out which is why the minimum term was the same as the starting point. The grounds of appeal in the same order in which we have identified the sentences are as follows. Ward submits that: 1. That the judge erred because he applied insufficient weight to his mitigation. 2. That the judge double counted the planning aspect of the offence as an aggravating feature and 3. That the sentence was disproportionate to the facts and background of the offence. In the case of Carla McGuire, her grounds are: 1. The judge erred in selecting a starting point of 25 years which was too high in the circumstances. 2. That the judge failed to make appropriate deductions for the applicant's mitigation, namely her limited role, her lack of intension to kill and the fact that she was acting out of misguided loyalty to her son, her age and her lack of previous convictions. In the case of Usherwood, her grounds of appeal are: 1. That the judge wrongly identified the starting point for the minimum term. It is submitted in the grounds and in the advice, and orally before us by Mr Peter Joyce, that the correct starting point was 25 years pursuant to Schedule 21. 2. The judge failed to properly take into account the applicant's mitigation in that she was a mother of three children and had not offended since 2007. 3. In the applicant's case, her involvement was not financially motivated, it was the result of misplaced loyalty. That third ground involves a submission that the judge ought to have treated Usherwood in that respect in the same way as he treated McGuire and that his factual distinction between them was therefore one which was not properly open to him. Those written grounds have been supplemented in the case of McGuire and Usherwood by succinct, powerful and appropriate oral submissions by Mr Bell and Mr Joyce. The single judge, having considered the matter on the papers, refused leave in each of these cases. He gave reasons which are full enough clearly to indicate why he felt that each of these applications was unarguable. He said this in the case of Leonard Ward: ""For the reasons he gave, having presided over your long trial, the judge was entitled to conclude that the murder was an offence of particularly high seriousness, being a murder done in the expectation of gain by reason of the commercial advantages to the business of drug supplying in which you were heavily involved, flowing from the attack in a context of organised crime and that you were a leading figure. The identification of the aggravating factor of significant planning was not double counting. This was not an offence with an exceptionally high starting point. Your culpability was also aggravated by your previous offending history, involving commercial drug dealing and violence. The mitigating factor of there not being an intent to kill could carry little weight given the judge's finding that it was obvious that the risk of death was very high. It is not arguable that the judge erred in principle or that the minimum term fell outside the appropriate range for an offence of this seriousness."" We agree with the single judge and with the trial judge in that analysis. In our judgment, it is simply unarguable that a minimum term of 32 years in the case of Leonard Ward is too long. It would, in our judgment, have been open to the judge, had he thought it appropriate to do so, to impose a minimum term in the case of Leonard Ward which reflected a significantly greater increase in the appropriate starting point of 30 years than he in fact applied. In those circumstances, Leonard Ward's application for leave to appeal against sentence is refused. In the case of Carla McGuire the single judge said this: ""Having presided over the long trial of you and your co-accused, the judge was ideally placed to assess your role in the murder and culpability. He found you must have been aware of the use of your home prior to the arranged event in which Anton O'Connor was murdered in the context of the long-standing background of drug-dealing and your significant contribution to that planned event and its aftermath. He also found that you that knew weapons, including the one used by Michael Mingoes, would be deployed, so the appropriate statutory starting point was 25 years' custody. The reduced term of 20 years took account of the lesser role you played, your lack of relevant previous convictions and your not having an intent to kill, though the judge stated it must have been obvious to you that the risk that someone might die was a very high one. It is not arguable that the sentence fell outside the appropriate range and did not take account of your role and culpability. "" Mr Bell has submitted that the minimum term of 20 years, given those findings which we have set out above and which the single judge referred to, as to the level of involvement of Carla McGuire and her motivation, was simply too long. We disagree. This was lesser involvement in an extremely serious killing which was done in furtherance of offending, namely widespread supply of Class A controlled drugs, which was itself extremely serious. The use of lethal violence in pursuit of serious crime is an extremely serious offence. In our judgment, the judge's analysis of McGuire's case did full justice to the points which can properly be made on her behalf, as can be shown by the fact that her minimum term was only two-thirds that imposed upon her more deeply involved co-accused, Usherwood, to whose case we now turn. In the case of Usherwood the single judge said this: ""The judge, who had presided at your long trial and was ideally placed to assess your role in the events leading up to and surrounding the murder, was satisfied that you were closely affiliated to the Nottingham Organised Crime Group, that your home was used as a longstanding base for the drugs business and that you knew of the plan for a team from Manchester to be sent down to Nottingham. You played a significant role in relation to the plan and, in particular, the CCTV footage, destroying evidence. The judge was entitled to find this was an offence of particularly high seriousness, being a murder for gain, and take a starting point of 30 years with the feature of a significant degree of planning. As he observed, it must have been obvious that someone might die, even if there was no intent to kill. He took account of your personal circumstances. It is not arguable that the sentence fell outside the appropriate range or was arguably manifestly excessive."" Notwithstanding Mr Joyce's persuasive submissions, we agree with the single judge. This applicant was deeply involved in the planning and execution of this killing. She was also deeply involved in the underlying business, the protection of which was the purpose of the killing. She had become a serious organised violent criminal who perpetrated a killing. Having been convicted of murder for gain, she cannot complain that the appropriate minimum term in her case was the starting point prescribed by the statute for such cases. For those reasons, each of these three applications is refused. Mr Bell and Mr Joyce, we repeat our thanks to both of you for your help.

An agreement was reached that he would go to the area around No 121, where he would be trapped and then attacked by a gang who had come down from Manchester for that purpose. None of these applicants was part of the Manchester squad. The judge dealt with the case on the basis that it may not have been intended that McKenzie would be killed but it was certainly the case that he would suffer really serious injury. In the event, he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Manchester team called ""Mingoes"" and died at the scene. These three applicants were said to have been involved in planning this trap and to different degrees in implementing it. The reason O'Connor rather than McKenzie died was that McKenzie decided not to attend the meeting himself but to send Mr O' Connor along instead. Usherwood had been involved on the day of the attack, with another, in meeting McKenzie at Poet's Corner. The allegation was that that meeting was to make arrangements for him to attend a further meeting later that night, at which he would be ambushed and attacked by the Manchester team which would either kill him or cause him, at the least, really serious harm. Carla McGuire had installed CCTV cameras at No 121 on 14 October 2021, just a couple of weeks before this happened. That CCTV footage contained significant evidence showing the arrival of the hit team from Manchester and showing that team leaving the property on two occasions, which were said to be reconnaissance expeditions. On the second of those expeditions they used a set of untraceable bicycles and it was said that McGuire and Usherwood had both been involved in obtaining those. When the deceased arrived the CCTV was turned off by McGuire, so that it would not capture the attack. This was an important part of the case against her because the prosecution invited the jury to draw the inference that she must have known that there was going to be an attack. The CCTV was turned on again at a time when it captured some members of the Nottingham syndicate which had organised this attack attempting to administer CPR to the dead or dying O'Connor. No doubt it was thought that that footage might be helpful in strong contrast to the footage which McGuire had been careful to ensure would never come into existence of the attack itself. The manipulation of the CCTV cameras therefore at and around the time of the attack indicated a fairly detailed knowledge by her of what was to happen and of what had happened. The attack itself occurred when O'Connor arrived at the scene of the meeting. Usherwood was in a vehicle. She drove out of a road nearby sounding the vehicle's horn in order to attract the hit team. McGuire and others came out of No 121 at that point, and the crowd thereby formed prevented Mr O' Connor from escaping. Usherwood continued to manoeuvre her car around the area to obstruct his escape. The hit team then appeared. At this point O'Connor was trapped behind a car and was stabbed by Mingoes, causing his death. Afterwards steps were taken to get the Manchester team safely away and to remove and destroy clothing which had been worn. At this stage McGuire's involvement was limited to dealing with the CCTV in the way that we've have described. Usherwood though was actively involved in dealing with the Manchester team's escape and dealing with clothing and the destruction of a vehicle which had been used. Soon afterwards McKenzie and his associates made an attempt on Usherwood's life but the handgun which they had jammed. That, in a nutshell, is a description by way of summary of the facts giving rise to these convictions for murder. The judge had, when determining sentence, a thorough knowledge, far more extensive than our summary would suggest, of the facts of the case having presided over this very long case. He also had victim personal statements about the consequences of the death of O'Connor for those who loved him. So far as antecedents are concerned, Usherwood had eight convictions, most recently in 2008, including a conviction in December 2007 for supplying Class C drugs for which he had received a 12-month prison sentence. McGuire had only three previous convictions, none of which was of direct relevance and she had not previously been sent to prison. Ward had 20 convictions between 2000 and 2017, including a conviction in May 2012, for possession with intent to supply Class B drugs and possession of a firearm, for which he had been sent to prison for 5 years. His last conviction was in October 2017 for wounding, for which he received a custodial sentence of 20 months. The judge did not have pre-sentence reports, none being necessary in the circumstances of this case either then or now. In his sentencing remarks the judge found that the attack was deliberately planned and intended not only as a show of force but also a plan involving the actual use of force which would fall short of an intention to kill. He said he was not sure that there was an intention to kill given the proximity of this killing to No 121, which was an address occupied by McGuire and other members of the relevant syndicate. The dealing by McGuire of the CCTV occurred at the last minute and the arrangements for the retreat were also somewhat disorganised. So far as Ward was concerned, the judge found that he was a leading figure in the syndicate which was attempting to defend its turf and that he had played a leading role in instigating the plan. He was sentenced on the basis that he knew that the plan involved infliction of serious violence on, as was intended McKenzie but as it happened O'Connor, and that he was closely involved in monitoring events throughout the relevant day. The judge had to consider, of course, Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020 and to decide on the appropriate starting point. He concluded in the circumstances of this case that this was an offence of murder for gain attracting the 30-year starting point. There were in the case of Ward aggravating features involving his leading role and careful planning. He also had significant previous convictions and knew that the attackers from Manchester would be armed. The judge balanced those aggravating features against such mitigating features as there were and concluded that the minimum term should be higher than the starting point and fixed it at 32 years. In the case of McGuire, the judge found that she knew that her house (No 121) was being used as the operational base of the drug dealing syndicate. She was aware that that business was under threat because of the new rival on the block (McKenzie), so she knew why the hit team were at her property on the day of the murder. The judge found that she shared in the common intention in relation to the attack. She had dealt with the CCTV in the way that we have described at the request of her son, who was another member of this syndicate, and then had attempted to cover it up. The judge concluded that in her case this was not a murder for gain; she had been motivated by a desire to protect her own safety and also out of misguided loyalty to her family. He was satisfied that she knew that weapons would be used and therefore the appropriate starting point from Schedule 21 was 25 years. The judge considered the aggravating features, namely the level of planning that was involved and weighed against those the mitigating features. The mitigation was primarily to be derived from her lesser involvement in the plan than others and her motivation which was different from that of others. That motivation of course had already operated to reduce the starting point in her case from 30 years to 25 years and therefore had limited further traction at that stage. The judge balancing mitigation against aggravating features made a downward adjustment from the starting point in her case to 20 years. In the case of Usherwood, the judge found that she was closely affiliated with Ward's syndicate operating in The Meadows area of Nottingham. Mr Joyce on her behalf has described her behaviour during the trial as abrasive, difficult and uncontrolled. The judge concluded that she was a person who was aggressively assertive. Mr Joyce has submitted that given that irrational and uncontrolled behaviour, she would be the last person that any sensible drug-dealing syndicate would trust with any significant part in its activities or any knowledge of them. The judge thought, and found, that actually her aggressive assertiveness had its uses from the point of view of a syndicate which was under attack and having to defend its turf in a power struggle. The judge found that she had been involved in the meeting with McKenzie which we have described, and that she had been involved in driving the hit team around and in the attack itself using her car in the way that we have described. In those circumstances, the judge found that in her case this was involvement in a plot which culminated in murder and that that plot was designed to secure the gain for her syndicate and that it was therefore in her case a murder for gain attracting the starting point of 30 years. In her case the judge weighted the mitigating features against the aggravating features and found that they cancelled each other out which is why the minimum term was the same as the starting point. The grounds of appeal in the same order in which we have identified the sentences are as follows. Ward submits that: 1. That the judge erred because he applied insufficient weight to his mitigation. 2. That the judge double counted the planning aspect of the offence as an aggravating feature and 3. That the sentence was disproportionate to the facts and background of the offence. In the case of Carla McGuire, her grounds are: 1. The judge erred in selecting a starting point of 25 years which was too high in the circumstances. 2. That the judge failed to make appropriate deductions for the applicant's mitigation, namely her limited role, her lack of intension to kill and the fact that she was acting out of misguided loyalty to her son, her age and her lack of previous convictions. In the case of Usherwood, her grounds of appeal are: 1. That the judge wrongly identified the starting point for the minimum term. It is submitted in the grounds and in the advice, and orally before us by Mr Peter Joyce, that the correct starting point was 25 years pursuant to Schedule 21. 2. The judge failed to properly take into account the applicant's mitigation in that she was a mother of three children and had not offended since 2007. 3. In the applicant's case, her involvement was not financially motivated, it was the result of misplaced loyalty. That third ground involves a submission that the judge ought to have treated Usherwood in that respect in the same way as he treated McGuire and that his factual distinction between them was therefore one which was not properly open to him. Those written grounds have been supplemented in the case of McGuire and Usherwood by succinct, powerful and appropriate oral submissions by Mr Bell and Mr Joyce. The single judge, having considered the matter on the papers, refused leave in each of these cases. He gave reasons which are full enough clearly to indicate why he felt that each of these applications was unarguable. He said this in the case of Leonard Ward: ""For the reasons he gave, having presided over your long trial, the judge was entitled to conclude that the murder was an offence of particularly high seriousness, being a murder done in the expectation of gain by reason of the commercial advantages to the business of drug supplying in which you were heavily involved, flowing from the attack in a context of organised crime and that you were a leading figure. The identification of the aggravating factor of significant planning was not double counting. This was not an offence with an exceptionally high starting point. Your culpability was also aggravated by your previous offending history, involving commercial drug dealing and violence. The mitigating factor of there not being an intent to kill could carry little weight given the judge's finding that it was obvious that the risk of death was very high. It is not arguable that the judge erred in principle or that the minimum term fell outside the appropriate range for an offence of this seriousness."" We agree with the single judge and with the trial judge in that analysis. In our judgment, it is simply unarguable that a minimum term of 32 years in the case of Leonard Ward is too long. It would, in our judgment, have been open to the judge, had he thought it appropriate to do so, to impose a minimum term in the case of Leonard Ward which reflected a significantly greater increase in the appropriate starting point of 30 years than he in fact applied. In those circumstances, Leonard Ward's application for leave to appeal against sentence is refused. In the case of Carla McGuire the single judge said this: ""Having presided over the long trial of you and your co-accused, the judge was ideally placed to assess your role in the murder and culpability. He found you must have been aware of the use of your home prior to the arranged event in which Anton O'Connor was murdered in the context of the long-standing background of drug-dealing and your significant contribution to that planned event and its aftermath. He also found that you that knew weapons, including the one used by Michael Mingoes, would be deployed, so the appropriate statutory starting point was 25 years' custody. The reduced term of 20 years took account of the lesser role you played, your lack of relevant previous convictions and your not having an intent to kill, though the judge stated it must have been obvious to you that the risk that someone might die was a very high one. It is not arguable that the sentence fell outside the appropriate range and did not take account of your role and culpability. "" Mr Bell has submitted that the minimum term of 20 years, given those findings which we have set out above and which the single judge referred to, as to the level of involvement of Carla McGuire and her motivation, was simply too long. We disagree. This was lesser involvement in an extremely serious killing which was done in furtherance of offending, namely widespread supply of Class A controlled drugs, which was itself extremely serious. The use of lethal violence in pursuit of serious crime is an extremely serious offence. In our judgment, the judge's analysis of McGuire's case did full justice to the points which can properly be made on her behalf, as can be shown by the fact that her minimum term was only two-thirds that imposed upon her more deeply involved co-accused, Usherwood, to whose case we now turn. In the case of Usherwood the single judge said this: ""The judge, who had presided at your long trial and was ideally placed to assess your role in the events leading up to and surrounding the murder, was satisfied that you were closely affiliated to the Nottingham Organised Crime Group, that your home was used as a longstanding base for the drugs business and that you knew of the plan for a team from Manchester to be sent down to Nottingham. You played a significant role in relation to the plan and, in particular, the CCTV footage, destroying evidence. The judge was entitled to find this was an offence of particularly high seriousness, being a murder for gain, and take a starting point of 30 years with the feature of a significant degree of planning. As he observed, it must have been obvious that someone might die, even if there was no intent to kill. He took account of your personal circumstances. It is not arguable that the sentence fell outside the appropriate range or was arguably manifestly excessive."" Notwithstanding Mr Joyce's persuasive submissions, we agree with the single judge. This applicant was deeply involved in the planning and execution of this killing. She was also deeply involved in the underlying business, the protection of which was the purpose of the killing. She had become a serious organised violent criminal who perpetrated a killing. Having been convicted of murder for gain, she cannot complain that the appropriate minimum term in her case was the starting point prescribed by the statute for such cases. For those reasons, each of these three applications is refused. Mr Bell and Mr Joyce, we repeat our thanks to both of you for your help."

Nothing the sentencing judge, nor this court on appeal, can say will ever measure the impact of the death of a young child on family relations and friends. We have read the statement from the mother of young Michaela who died and, whilst we can never feel the same tragic emotion that she must feel, we can readily appreciate it. But the death of this young child was caused in a remarkably short period by this appellant, whose behaviour prior to the incident in May 2004 could never have been expected. The appellant had started to live with Michaela's mother, Amanda Richards, in Plymouth in February. Although there had been thought to be some dispute about this, by the time the judge came to sentence it was plain that this appellant had exhibited no feelings or animosity or violence towards the young child he killed. Michaela was one of four young children. The appellant was apparently good towards them and had devoted all of his limited resources towards their upkeep - this was not something Michaela's mother had experienced before. The occasion of Michaela's death was her birthday. She was only two. The appellant had bought her presents and had taken her on 12th May to Plymouth town centre whilst the rest of the children were at school. He returned at a time that, whilst there was some dispute about it at trial, appears to have been 2.49 in the afternoon. It would take about two to three minutes for him, with Michaela, to walk from the bus stop to home, possibly slightly more. It is clear from computer records that an ambulance was called at 2.52. Thus, the occasion of the killing of Michaela took place in a very short period indeed, probably about two minutes. It appears that this appellant lost his temper and shook her in a way that caused her immediate death. Just after that the appellant came out of the house carrying Michaela in his arms. She was limp, unconscious and having difficulty breathing. When the local residents came to help the ambulance was called at the time we have identified. Unfortunately, but not unusually in cases of this kind, the appellant was unable to face what he had in fact done and both before and during the trial denied that he was responsible for the injuries which, as the doctor said, must have been the result of shaking with considerable force and were inconsistent with any fall from the bed as had been suggested. As we have said, the appellant denied that he was responsible and he was charged with murder. At the close of the prosecution case the judge, Owen J, ruled that there was insufficient evidence of a murderous intention. Manslaughter was left to the jury. We can well understand that, having faced a charge of murder and having had that dismissed only immediately before he was due to give evidence, the appellant felt unable to accept his responsibility at that stage. Thus the issue of manslaughter went before the jury and he was convicted of that offence. The judge, in his sentencing remarks, accepted that the appellant was very good with the children and their siblings. He pointed out that there was no suggestion of any violence towards the children in the past, nor of animosity. The judge was faced with a young man of 23, and, as we have said, sentenced him in July 2005 to seven years' imprisonment. The issue is whether that sentence was manifestly excessive. There were important mitigating features in relation to this case. We have already identified the absence of any animosity or history of previous cruelty, let alone injury, towards the children. There was positive evidence of the appellant's good behaviour in supporting Michaela and the other children. The offence was not premeditated and took place, as we have said, in a very short space of time. This appellant had not been in trouble for offences such as this before. Not only was he only 23 at the time of his trial, he unfortunately suffered from limited intelligence amounting to a borderline learning disability. He had sought immediate help for the child as soon as he had shaken her in a way to cause her death. Against that, it has to be said that this was a very young girl of two who required the protection of the courts. The impact on the family, as we have said, was devastating and will continue to be. In those circumstances, we have had to consider whether the sentence of seven years was manifestly excessive. Our attention was drawn to a number of authorities. The authority of greatest assistance is the case of Yates [2001] Cr App R (S) 428. In that case this court identified the range of sentences on a plea of guilty as between two and five years and reduced a sentence of seven years in that case to one of five years. As Mr Evans QC, on behalf of this appellant, has pointed out, that case appears to be slightly worse in some respects since there was no evidence of any remorse, in contrast to this case, and there was evidence of previous incidents of violence towards the victim, but the appellant pleaded guilty. The fact that this appellant did not plead guilty, particularly in the face of a charge of murder, does not indicate that he did not suffer remorse. Moreover, we fully understand how it was difficult for him at so very late a stage once the murder charge had been dismissed, to change the unfortunate approach that he had adopted of denying his responsibility. We take the view that having regard to the mitigating factors which we have identified, notwithstanding the gravity of this offence, a sentence of seven years was manifestly excessive. Our view is that a sentence of five years' imprisonment would have been appropriate, reducing that sentence therefore by two years. In those circumstances we shall allow the appeal and substitute the sentence of seven years for one of five years' imprisonment.

On 9 June 2022 His Honour Judge Inman sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment for murder with a minimum term of 33 years, less days spent on remand. He handed down concurrent sentences for the other counts on which the applicant had also been convicted. The applicant now renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction for murder. He also renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence. Both applications were refused on the papers by the single judge. The facts The deceased was David Varlow. He was 78 and lived alone on Manor Lane. On Sunday 24 October 2021 at about 10.44 pm the deceased called the police about an attempted break in at his home. This was the attempted burglary. The police attended and discovered that the back window had been smashed. The police officer's uniform had CCTV attached to it and footage from that camera captured the deceased talking to the police about his life, including that he had a brother in the North East. The police noted that the property had overgrown shrubs and no security lights. It was set back from the road. On 2 November 2021, CCTV footage captured the deceased going out shopping. That was the last time he was seen alive. In the early hours of 3 November the applicant was seen on CCTV walking towards Manor Lane. The applicant was next seen on CCTV walking back towards Birmingham 40 minutes later at 5.57am. At 6.02am on that morning the applicant used the deceased's bank card at a cashpoint in Spies Lane. The balance was checked which at that time was £19,724.28. Seconds later a withdrawal was made of £250. At 6.12am the applicant got on a bus and headed back towards Birmingham. Over the next few days the applicant used the deceased's card to withdraw cash a number of times. A female identified as Stephanie Wyatt was also seen using the deceased's card. On the evening of 11 November 2021 the applicant and his co-accused named Swan returned to the applicant's property. Approximately 25 minutes later at 12.25am on 12 November they were seen leaving the area again. At 00.33 that morning an unsuccessful attempt was made to use one of the deceased's cards which had by then expired. Between 3 November and 14 November 2021 the deceased's card was used 389 times and a total of around £8,000 was obtained with £13,000 attempted. On 14 November 2021 the deceased's brother called the deceased but got no answer. He tried to call again on 15 November and when there was no answer he contacted the deceased's neighbours who visited the property. When there was no answer the neighbour called the police who attended at 2.45pm on 15 November. The police found papers strewn on the floor in the living room, which included bank details showing an average balance in excess of £13,000. There had been a further search in the bedroom and the mattress had been moved. The deceased was found lying face down on the floor next to an upturned chair. One of his arms was across his back. There was a cord around the back legs of the chair and there was a knife on the floor nearby. A post-mortem examination found that the deceased's heart was in very poor condition and he was liable at any stage to a heart attack. It was said that the stress caused by the burglary and being tied up had in all likelihood caused a heart attack. The deceased had died sometime between 3 and 11 November 2021, although it was not possible to say when. There was no evidence of blunt force trauma or that he had been beaten. However there were injuries to his ankles and wrists which indicated he had been bound. The marks on his left ankle were consistent with having been bound with a telephone cable which was found and as had been wrapped around his ankle twice. There were more indentations on the right ankle along with hypostasis and sparring. Sparring occurs when dead. The pathologist stated that those findings meant that the deceased had been tried up whilst he was alive and had been untied once he was dead. The applicant's DNA was found on the knife and on the inside of the finger holes on the scissors found at the scene, along with DNA of the deceased and at least two others with regards to the knife and one other with regard to the scissors. The applicant's DNA was also found on the cable tied to the chair, along with the deceased's and one other person's. The applicant was arrested on 19 November 2021. He answered three questions effectively denying involvement with the burglaries and death, and thereafter answered no comment. At trial the prosecution case was that the applicant had attempted to burgle the deceased's property on 24 October 2021. When he returned days later to burgle the deceased again, the applicant had tied the deceased so securely to a chair that he knew it would be impossible for the deceased to free himself and he did so knowing that no one would come to help the deceased or to check on him. The deceased would have pleaded with the applicant not to be tied up and left and would have made it clear that he would not be found or helped. By restraining him and leaving him in these circumstances the applicant intended that the deceased should die and he knew the deceased was dead when he returned on 11 November to steal another card. Even if he only wanted to restrain the deceased for as long as possible to enable him to use the card, it was virtually certain that an elderly man tied up for eight days or more would die or suffer really serious injury. The defence case was that the applicant had not been involved. He said he did not go into the property and that the prosecution witnesses had lied. The DNA experts could not say how his DNA was left on the items. The applicant said it was his co-defendant Swan who had gone into the property and come out with the card and PIN number. Alternatively, he argued that the jury could not be sure that he had the requisite intention for murder. The deceased, he said, may have died from the heart attack before the applicant left the house and therefore the applicant knew or had believed at the point that he left the house that the deceased was already dead, or perhaps the deceased had lied and had said that somebody would come to visit the house in order to put the applicant off and that the applicant had thereafter believed that the deceased would be visit and would be found. By the visit to the property on 11 November, the applicant must have realised that the deceased had died but it did not mean he intended him to die when he had been left on 3 November. His case on this version of events would lead to a verdict of guilty for manslaughter but not murder. The issues for the jury were, first of all, factual: was the applicant involved? And secondly, intention: if the applicant was involved, did the applicant intend to kill or cause really serious harm to the deceased? Conviction We deal first with the application so far as it relates to conviction. Mr Emanuel KC and Miss Feen appear for the applicant and represented him at trial. They advance two grounds of appeal against the conviction for murder, arguing that manslaughter should be substituted. There is no application in relation to the other counts on which the applicant was convicted. They argue, first, that there was no evidence upon which a jury could be sure that the applicant had the requisite mens rea for murder and as such the judge should have acceded to the submission of no case to answer. This is ground 1. Secondly, they argue that the judge's directions on the mens rea for murder were flawed because they failed to direct the jury that they had to be sure that (a) the deceased was still conscious after he had been tied up and (b) the deceased was still alive when the applicant left the house and the applicant believed that the deceased was still alive when he left the house. This is ground two. These grounds were expanded in written and oral submissions before us today. The Crown's arguments are set out in a helpful Respondent's Notice. The Crown submits that the judge was correct to reject the submission of no case to answer. There were sufficient inferences to be drawn as to murderous intent. The Crown submits that the judge's summing-up was correct because it was not an essential ingredient of the prosecution case and of the offence itself that the deceased was alive when the applicant left the house. If the jury found the defendant tied the deceased up with murderous intent, the prosecution said that it did not matter when he died. We wish to thank all counsel for the considerable assistance that this court has been given. Ground 1 The applicant argues that there were realistic scenarios which the jury could not exclude on the evidence before them, which scenarios were not consistent with an intention to kill or cause really serious harm to the deceased. In light of those scenarios, it is said that the judge should have acceded to the submission of no case to answer on the murder charge. The scenarios can perhaps be summarised as follows. First, that the deceased died at or shortly after the point that he was tied up and was already dead or at least dying when the applicant left his house. That scenario was consistent, so it has been argued before us, with an intention on the part of the applicant to tie him up for only a short time, possibly only while the applicant burgled the house or perhaps simply in order to get his PIN number. That intention, in other words to tie up for a short time, was said to be inconsistent with an intention that the deceased should die by being left, quite simply because he was already dead by the time the applicant left the house. So it was argued that the intention on that scenario was something short of that required for murder. Alternatively, if the deceased was alive at the point that the applicant left the house, it was argued that the jury could not be sure that the applicant's intention was to leave him there until he died because it was possible that the applicant had hoped or expected someone to come to the deceased's house before he died or perhaps that he had not cared either way. Mr Emanuel suggested there were strands of evidence which supported this alternative scenario. He argued that the jury could not be sure that the applicant knew or intended that no one would come, which was how the prosecution argued their case on intent for murder. These arguments were all articulated before the judge at the point that the submission of no case to answer was made. That ruling was delivered on 6 May 2022. It is a careful ruling which pays close attention to the evidence and the arguments. As the judge emphasised, the evidence indicated that the deceased had been alive at the point he was tied to the chair on 3 November 2021. The pathologist could not say when death had occurred after that, simply that it had occurred at some point between 3 and 15 November. The pathologist also said that the deceased was dead by the time his ligatures were cut away, which was on 11 November when he was released from the chair by the applicant and fell to the ground where he was eventually found. The medical evidence suggested that from the moment of onset of a heart attack, which was likely to have occurred around the point of the most intense part of the trauma, death would have taken at least 30 minutes to occur and was more likely to have taken around one hour. The judge concluded, having considered all the evidence that had been adduced by the prosecution, that it would be open to a jury to infer that the purpose of binding someone in the way that the deceased was bound was to stop them alerting anyone else. That is at page 8A. Further, it would be open to a jury to conclude that the deceased would have been petrified when he was tied up and would have said to the applicant that if he was left in that position no one would find him for a very long time and possibly not until 14 November, which was when his brother was due to call; it would be open to the jury to take the applicant's use of the card over the succeeding days as evidence of his intention to leave the deceased to die; it would be open to the jury to conclude that the applicant's failure to summon help when he returned to the deceased's house on 11 November (or indeed at any time) shows that he knew or expected the deceased to be dead and that finding him on 11 November came as no surprise. By his ruling the judge concluded: ""The jury, therefore, on that evidence could perfectly properly conclude that the defendant tied Mr Varlow to the chair, having got the information that he needed, knowing that he would not be found -- and indeed, they would be entitled to find, knowing that he would not be found until 14 November -- and left him there with the intention that he should die there."" The judge rejected Mr Emanuel's submission that the jury could not be sure that the alternative propositions (or scenarios) had not occurred. The judge said the jury could be sure of the prosecution's case theory and that there was ""ample evidence"" to support the prosecution's case that the deceased had been tied up and left to die. We find no fault with the ruling. It was plainly open to the judge to conclude that the jury could be sure that when the applicant tied up the deceased, the applicant intended him to die there. It was plainly open to the judge to conclude that the jury could properly reject the defence arguments about the applicant's intention being something less than or different from that. They could reject those arguments safely and on the evidence about what happened before, during and after the deceased was tied up, although the point in time when the jury had to be satisfied that the applicant had the intention for murder was at the point he was tied up. There was, in our judgment, evidence to support the prosecution's case and a solid basis on which a reasonable jury properly directed could reject the possibility of all the defence scenarios and conclude that they were speculative, fanciful or simply did not occur. This was very much jury territory. The judge was right in his analysis. We agree with the single judge and we refuse permission to appeal on this ground of appeal. Ground 2 The predicate of ground 2 is that the judge was required to direct the jury that the deceased remained conscious after he was tied up and was still alive when the applicant left the house, as the applicant knew or believed. We do not accept that predicate. The precise time of death was not the issue for the jury. The issue for the jury was the applicant's intention in tying the deceased up and then leaving him in that state on 3 November 2021. The state of the applicant's mind was the proper focus of the judge's comments in the exchanges in court cited by the applicant in his grounds - see for example pages 22 and 23 of the applicant's grounds where extracts from the transcript are set out. The judge considered very carefully how he was to approach this aspect of the case. The question posed for the jury which is of relevance is question 5 on the route to verdict, set out at page 14A of the relevant transcript: ""Are you sure that by tying up Mr Varlow and leaving him in that state [the applicant] intended to kill him or cause him really serious injury?"" The judge did not need to include the question that was proposed by the defence, going to the applicant's belief or otherwise that the deceased was alive when he left his house on 3 November. This was not properly part of the route to verdict. That point, on analysis, was simply an argument forming part of the defence case to the effect that the applicant might have left the deceased already dead. If that was what had occurred in fact then it was suggested that that would be consistent with the applicant not intending to cause death or serious injury at all but rather with a lesser intention simply to tie the deceased up M for a short time, perhaps while the applicant burgled the deceased's house or perhaps in order to extract the PIN number for the cards from him. The judge set out that line of argument in the legal directions: see paragraphs 31 and 32 and see the transcript of his summing-up at page 9. The jury was well aware of that argument, but it was just an argument. The judge was right not to include it as a step on the route to verdict. In the event the jury rejected that argument. The jury plainly considered that it lacked any cogent support in the evidence. They were sure of the prosecution's case. We therefore agree with the single judge. We refuse leave for this ground of appeal. Sentence We therefore turn to the submissions on sentence. In passing sentence, the judge noted that the applicant was a professional burglar and much of his lifestyle was spent in a drugs den in Birmingham. There was no significant mitigation. He had many convictions for burglary, although none for violence. The judge imposed a life sentence for the murder alongside concurrent sentences on the other counts. The judge's starting point for the minimum term was 30 years because this was a murder for gain. There were significant aggravating factors: the fact that the deceased was elderly and vulnerable, the fact that the applicant had gone back to change the position of the body, the fact that there was a further burglary and an earlier attempted burglary of the deceased's home and the terrible nature of the killing and suffering inflicted on the deceased. The applicant showed no remorse. There was an intention to kill. The applicant had an extensive record of offending. So far as mitigation was concerned, the judge accepted that there was no premeditation at the point the applicant commenced the burglary but there was a degree of premeditation in the way the applicant had killed the deceased. He imposed a minimum term of 33 years with concurrent sentences for the other offences. In their grounds of appeal the defence argue that the minimum term imposed was manifestly excessive for four reasons. They are that the judge was wrong: first, to sentence on the basis that there was an intention to kill and that therefore the applicant was not entitled to the mitigation of an absence of intention to kill; secondly, to sentence on the basis that there was some element of premeditation and that therefore the applicant was not entitled to the mitigation of an absence of premeditation; thirdly, to conclude that the short-lived nature of any suffering was not relevant to the sentencing exercise; and fourth, to conclude that the presence of an intention to cause suffering could amount to an aggravating feature. The judge had presided over the trial and was familiar with the evidence. He was plainly entitled to conclude so that he was sure that the applicant had intended to kill the deceased. It is not difficult to see how on these facts the judge reached that conclusion. We reject the various points raised in the grounds of appeal. The act of tying the deceased up was deliberate and involved some pre-planning and the judge was entitled so to conclude. It is unknown how long the deceased remained alive and conscious. The judge was entitled to conclude that he might not have died quickly. It is one of the troubling features of this case that the timing of death is uncertain and may have been slow. The way the deceased was treated must have caused him great suffering. That undoubtedly increased the seriousness of the offence. Standing back, we see no reason to conclude that the sentence imposed was overly long. To the contrary, in our judgment a longer minimum term could have been imposed for this appalling and cruel murder of a defenceless old man in his own home. In agreement with the single judge we refuse permission to appeal against sentence. Conclusion This application is refused.

On 9 June 2022 His Honour Judge Inman sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment for murder with a minimum term of 33 years, less days spent on remand. He handed down concurrent sentences for the other counts on which the applicant had also been convicted. The applicant now renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction for murder. He also renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence. Both applications were refused on the papers by the single judge. The facts The deceased was David Varlow. He was 78 and lived alone on Manor Lane. On Sunday 24 October 2021 at about 10.44 pm the deceased called the police about an attempted break in at his home. This was the attempted burglary. The police attended and discovered that the back window had been smashed. The police officer's uniform had CCTV attached to it and footage from that camera captured the deceased talking to the police about his life, including that he had a brother in the North East. The police noted that the property had overgrown shrubs and no security lights. It was set back from the road. On 2 November 2021, CCTV footage captured the deceased going out shopping. That was the last time he was seen alive. In the early hours of 3 November the applicant was seen on CCTV walking towards Manor Lane. The applicant was next seen on CCTV walking back towards Birmingham 40 minutes later at 5.57am. At 6.02am on that morning the applicant used the deceased's bank card at a cashpoint in Spies Lane. The balance was checked which at that time was £19,724.28. Seconds later a withdrawal was made of £250. At 6.12am the applicant got on a bus and headed back towards Birmingham. Over the next few days the applicant used the deceased's card to withdraw cash a number of times. A female identified as Stephanie Wyatt was also seen using the deceased's card. On the evening of 11 November 2021 the applicant and his co-accused named Swan returned to the applicant's property. Approximately 25 minutes later at 12.25am on 12 November they were seen leaving the area again. At 00.33 that morning an unsuccessful attempt was made to use one of the deceased's cards which had by then expired. Between 3 November and 14 November 2021 the deceased's card was used 389 times and a total of around £8,000 was obtained with £13,000 attempted. On 14 November 2021 the deceased's brother called the deceased but got no answer. He tried to call again on 15 November and when there was no answer he contacted the deceased's neighbours who visited the property. When there was no answer the neighbour called the police who attended at 2.45pm on 15 November. The police found papers strewn on the floor in the living room, which included bank details showing an average balance in excess of £13,000. There had been a further search in the bedroom and the mattress had been moved. The deceased was found lying face down on the floor next to an upturned chair. One of his arms was across his back. There was a cord around the back legs of the chair and there was a knife on the floor nearby. A post-mortem examination found that the deceased's heart was in very poor condition and he was liable at any stage to a heart attack. It was said that the stress caused by the burglary and being tied up had in all likelihood caused a heart attack. The deceased had died sometime between 3 and 11 November 2021, although it was not possible to say when. There was no evidence of blunt force trauma or that he had been beaten. However there were injuries to his ankles and wrists which indicated he had been bound. The marks on his left ankle were consistent with having been bound with a telephone cable which was found and as had been wrapped around his ankle twice. There were more indentations on the right ankle along with hypostasis and sparring. Sparring occurs when dead. The pathologist stated that those findings meant that the deceased had been tried up whilst he was alive and had been untied once he was dead. The applicant's DNA was found on the knife and on the inside of the finger holes on the scissors found at the scene, along with DNA of the deceased and at least two others with regards to the knife and one other with regard to the scissors. The applicant's DNA was also found on the cable tied to the chair, along with the deceased's and one other person's. The applicant was arrested on 19 November 2021.

The act of tying the deceased up was deliberate and involved some pre-planning and the judge was entitled so to conclude. It is unknown how long the deceased remained alive and conscious. The judge was entitled to conclude that he might not have died quickly. It is one of the troubling features of this case that the timing of death is uncertain and may have been slow. The way the deceased was treated must have caused him great suffering. That undoubtedly increased the seriousness of the offence. Standing back, we see no reason to conclude that the sentence imposed was overly long. To the contrary, in our judgment a longer minimum term could have been imposed for this appalling and cruel murder of a defenceless old man in his own home. In agreement with the single judge we refuse permission to appeal against sentence. Conclusion This application is refused."

MR JUSTICE GOOSE: On 28 September 2018 in the Crown Court at Norwich, the appellant Martin Ayres, who is now aged 36, was sentenced to imprisonment for life, with a minimum term of 10 years' custody for attempted murder. He had previously pleaded guilty on 4 May 2018, being at the earliest reasonable opportunity. The appellant now appeals with leave against that sentence. His appeal is confined to the minimum term of custody imposed. He accepts that imprisonment for life cannot be the subject of any arguable appeal. At the time when this offence was committed the appellant was a serving prisoner at HMP Wayland. On 5 February 2004 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for life for an offence of murder, with a minimum custodial term of approximately twelve-and-a-half years. On 15 August 2017 the appellant was sharing a cell with the complainant, another serving prisoner. Although it was believed that the relationship between the appellant and the complainant was peaceful, there had been an altercation between the two men earlier in the week. At around 12.15 pm the prison wing was in lock down, due to staff shortages. This meant that all prisoners were locked in their cells. At lunchtime food was taken to the prisoners who were required to remain in their cells. Whilst the appellant and the complainant were eating their lunch, the appellant used a razor blade to cut strips from the bottom of a sheet that was acting as a shower curtain. The complainant was unaware of the appellant's intentions as he prepared a tourniquet. In an unprovoked attack the appellant put the tourniquet around the neck of the complainant using it as a ligature to strangle and murder him. He held on forcefully for a significant period of time whilst the complainant struggled and lost consciousness. Adjourning cell mates had heard the disturbance and also the appellant say: ""I've done something stupid you'd better get some help."" The alarm was raised and prison officers arrived to observe the complainant with the ligature still around his neck and in an unconscious or recovering state. It was obvious that a clear attempt had been made to kill the complainant. The appellant was isolated from other prisoners and later arrested. The appellant was interviewed by police officers and made full and frank admissions, stating that he had attempted to kill the complainant. He had become annoyed with him and had been planning to kill him for a few days. In the sentence hearing before His Honour Judge Holt, the Honorary Recorder of Norwich, it was accepted on behalf of the appellant that a sentence of imprisonment for life was inevitable given his previous murder conviction. Equally, it was accepted that this was at the most serious level of attempted murder because had it been a charge of murder it would have fallen within paragraphs 4 or 5 of schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Accordingly, this was clearly a Level 1 offence within the Attempted Murder Guideline of the Sentencing Guidelines Council. The issue before the sentencing judge was where within the range of sentencing at Level 1 this offence fell. The prosecution submitted it fell within the upper range with a starting point of 30 years custody,because the complainant had suffered serious and long-term psychological harm. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that it fell within the middle of the range with a starting point of 20 years' custody because some psychological harm was caused falling short of serious and long-term psychological harm. The sentence hearing was adjourned so that Dr Halsey, a consultant clinical and forensic neuropsychologist could give evidence upon the psychological harm caused to the complainant. On 28 September 2018 at the adjourned hearing, when the appellant was sentenced, Dr Halsey gave evidence and was cross-examined on behalf of the appellant. In his sentencing remarks the judge summarised the contents of Dr Halsey's written report dated 17 September 2018 and what he said in evidence. The judge then found that he was satisfied that long term and serious psychological harm had been caused. He said: ""... on the psychological expert evidence that I have had, I find that he has suffered long-term and serious psychological harm."" (see page 5C of the transcript) It is this finding of fact that the appellant now challenges with leave of the single judge. Whilst the complainant provided a Victim Personal Statement in which he described how he felt as a result of the offence, it does not provide any significant evidence in relation to the assessment of how serious or long term the psychological harm was. Accordingly, it is necessary to review the evidence before the judge. In his written report, Dr Halsey recorded that he had interviewed the complainant and obtained a history of the offence. The complainant described that the impact of the offence upon him had been devastating; he felt violated and angry. The complainant explained that he had a past history of mood swings but, since the offence these had increased. He now felt wary of others. There was evidence of some background of mental ill-health. The complainant stated that he had suffered a ""breakdown at the age of 27"" when he had a brief admission as a voluntary patient into a mental health clinic. The complainant described that he was ""damaged goods"" when he entered custody but ""I am going to be worse when I leave"". Dr Halsey observed that the complainant had not received any counselling or structured treatment. The complainant found it difficult to say whether he had been permanently affected by what had happened to him. Dr Halsey completed a psychometric assessment of the complainant, the Beck Anxiety and Beck Depressive Inventories. These involved self-administered structured questions for the complainant to answer in controlled testing. In Anxiety testing the complainant fell within the ""mild range"", but in Depression testing he fell within the ""severe range"". No other testing was carried out. In paragraph 5.1 of the report, Dr Halsey gave his opinion with caution, stating: ""I have not had access to any prison or medical records in the completion of the current report. The historical information contained within this report is based entirely upon Mr Rowe's account provided to me during interview, without reference to any corroborative information. The opinions contained herein are therefore preliminary..."" With that caveat Dr Halsey expressed the opinion that the complainant had symptoms that were consistent with a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (""PTSD""). Whilst giving evidence in the sentence hearing, Dr Halsey confirmed both his written opinion and his view. He was asked: ""... in regard to the long-term effects of the assault upon Mr Rowe, can you, just briefly, explain your opinion now, please."" Dr Halsey replied: ""Yes, again a caveat, which is that it is very difficult to predict the long-term effects of these sorts of problems, because of the variability between individuals. What can be said is that there are a significant proportion of individuals for which, fortunately, the symptoms that they suffer from, will gradually resolve given sufficient time. However, for approximately one-third of sufferers of PTSD the symptoms will remain a significant problem that require specialist treatments and intervention. It is very difficult to know in Mr Rowe's case whether or not his symptoms will respond positively to psychological interventions... because he has yet to engage in any psychological work in regard to these symptoms."" In cross-examination Dr Halsey accepted that he had not had access to the previous prison records in respect of the complainant, nor his medical records, so as to understand his pre-offence presentation. He said: ""If there was anything within the previous medical records, which indicated that the sorts of cognitive problems that Mr Rowe presented with to me, then of course that would provide an indication of the extent of any damage that may have occurred as a result of the assault."" Notwithstanding the fact that Dr Halsey's report was provided in advance of the sentencing hearing, the parties did not seek to obtain any further records relating to the complainant. Accordingly, the judge was required to make his assessment of harm based on the material before him. Based upon this evidence, the judge found that the complainant had suffered serious and long term psychological harm. No doubt, the judge was also influenced by the fact that the symptoms were still in place a year after the offence had occurred. On behalf of the appellant, however, it is argued that the evidence was incapable of establishing serious and long term psychological harm. On behalf of the respondent, it is argued that such a finding was open to the judge on the evidence of Dr Halsey. It has been necessary to set out the evidence of Dr Halsey, both in his written report and in evidence so as to understand the basis on which the judge reached his conclusion and the seriousness of the harm caused. It is clear from the evidence that the complainant was suffering from harm, which still continued a year after the offence. He was vulnerable, because he had some history of depression, which undoubtedly would have made his symptoms more serious after the attempt to murder him. Further, the effects of the assault upon him, to attempt to strangle him to death in a locked and confined cell, would have also substantially contributed to the seriousness of the psychological consequences for the complainant. Ultimately this was a question of judgement for the judge who heard Dr Halsey give evidence and the result of oral examination and cross-examination. The judge was entitled to find on the evidence that the harm caused by this attempted murder, was both serious and long term. We see no reason therefore to interfere with that finding. Further, on behalf of the appellant it is argued that the judge failed to give sufficient account to the fact that the appellant sought some help for the complainant after the attack. In our judgement that carried little weight in the circumstances of a case such as this where the attack upon him had been so severe and with such great intent. Therefore, in reaching a substantive sentence of 30 years, which he discounted to 20 years for his early plea and then halved to 10 years to arrive at the minimum term, we are satisfied that the judge cannot be faulted. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal against sentence. Epiq Europe Ltd hereby certify that the above is an accurate and complete record of the proceedings or part thereof.

He was caught at the top of the stairs to Victoria underground where he was attacked with bladed weapons, causing at least one cutting injury before he fell down the stairs into the ticket hall of the underground station. Whilst he was on the ground, a core group of those who had chased him ran down the stairs and effected a combined and lethal attack upon him. This included stabbing or cutting him with knives, kicking and punching him with force. The result was that Sofyen Belamouadden (to whom we shall now refer as the deceased) died. The case has presented the criminal justice system with very real challenges. In the event, at the Central Criminal Court, His Honour Judge Christopher Moss Q.C. conducted no fewer than five trials (which also encompassed re-trials following jury disagreement). In the first trial, on 16 May 2011, Christopher Omoregi (now 19) and Obi Nwokeh (now 20) were convicted of murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; Adonis Junior Akra (now 19), Femi Oderinwale (now 19) and Samuel Junior Roberts (now 20) were convicted of manslaughter and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; and Enoch Charles Amoah (now 20) was convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. In the second trial, on 11 August 2011, Samson Odegbune (now 19) was convicted of murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; and Tyrone Richards (now 18) was convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. Richards was acquitted of murder upon the judge's direction; Amoah, Akra, Oderinwale and Roberts had each been charged with murder, the jury returning convictions for the lesser offence of manslaughter. On 20 April 2012, the judge proceeded to sentence all offenders. Each of those convicted of murder (Omeregi, Nwokeh and Odegbune) was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure with a minimum term specified of 18 years and concurrent terms of 8 years detention in a young offender institution for conspiracy. Those convicted of manslaughter (Akra, Oderinwale and Roberts) received sentences of 12 years detention in a young offender institution; Akra and Roberts were sentenced to concurrent terms of 7 years detention for conspiracy; Oderinwale received 8 years concurrent for the same offence. Finally, Amoah was sentenced to 7 years detention in a young offender institution for conspiracy with a concurrent term of 3 years for violent disorder; Richards similarly received 7 years detention (in his case under s. 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000) with no separate penalty for violent disorder. In each case, time served was ordered to count. Odegbune, Amoah and Richards all appeal against sentence by leave of the single judge; Omeregi, Nwokeh, Akra, Oderinwale and Roberts all seek to renew their applications following refusal of leave. It is appropriate to mention the others charged in connection with this incident. In separate trials Victoria Osoteku and Junior Bayode were convicted of manslaughter. Osoteku was sentenced to 12 years in a young offender institution with a concurrent term of 8 years for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; for reasons which are irrelevant to this application, Bayode has not yet been sentenced. Chris Goncalves, Tayo Emmanuel Ajayi and Amari Wood were convicted after a retrial of violent disorder and received 30 months, 30 months and 27 months respectively in a young offender institution; Lewis Ryan Sinclair, Olawale Olaribigbe, Selassie Ahiaku, and Melvin Mensah were sentenced to 2 years in a young offender institution following their guilty pleas to offences of violent disorder. The Facts The background was the simmering tension between pupils at St Charles' Catholic Sixth Form College (""the College group"") and their associates, and others, predominantly from Hammersmith and Fulham (""the West London group""). There is no suggestion that the College group were other than a collection of individuals attending the college. It was forcefully contended on their behalf, however that the West London group constituted a street gang, known as GFL, short for ""Gangsters for Life"" or, possibly, ""Guns for Life"": it was said that they presented with a reputation for violence and confrontation. At some prior to 24 March 2010, there had been an incident at a party in relation to a girl between members of the two groups (in which Odegbune was involved). On 24 March 2010, members of the College saw two members of the West London group (Raheem Keane and Andre Willis) in the food hall at Victoria Station. There was a short confrontation the upshot of which was that Melvin Mensah (from the College) received a bloody nose: Keane and Willis (one of whom shouted a threat although not one which was heard by the College youths) ended up being arrested for a short while. Following this fight, there was clear evidence that the College group and the West London group envisaged another confrontation the following day: Mr Heywood described both sides as being involved in a pre-planned pitched encounter. Members of the College group communicated with one another using Facebook and mobile phones, as did the West London group. There was also communication between the groups, initially through intermediaries but eventually by contact (said by the Crown to be 'leader to leader') between Odegbune and Keane. Suffice to say, there was a considerable body of evidence showing the extent of such contact. It was said that the West London group would either be coming up to the College or would be at Victoria Station that afternoon. Once at college, on Thursday 25 March, the College group made more specific arrangements which amounted to a conspiracy to engage in an armed confrontation with the West London group later that day and to use weapons to cause grievous bodily harm. In the event, during the course of the day, the location for the planned encounter was confirmed as Victoria Station. The College group went to Victoria Station on 25 March on two buses, and arrived at the height of the rush hour and in broad daylight. Between them, they were heavily armed with an array of knives, including a set of kitchen knives specifically purchased for the purpose that afternoon. Although it was said that they had to pass through Victoria Station on their way home (whereas the West London group did not), the College group congregated and waited at the end of Terminus Place on the corner furthest away from where they would have alighted from their bus and then continued their journey. Many were in dark clothing with hoods or hats. Shortly thereafter, the West London group appeared at the opposite end of Terminus Place. That group were no doubt also ready and one was seen with his hands aloft saying ""Come on"". That confrontation commenced with Odegbune leading a charge of all those who subsequently became defendants chasing the West London group through Terminus Place, with weapons displayed. Odegbune himself was brandishing a samurai sword in front of him. Thereafter, the College group split with Odegbune, Richards, Oderinwale and others chasing Andre Zaplatel (one of the victim group) through Terminus Place. The other sixteen defendants chased the deceased who was associated with the West London group. By this time, he was isolated. As he approached the entrance to the underground station, he tripped and fell over a kerb stone, and his pursuers caught up with him. As events subsequently proved, the deceased was unarmed: what he was seen to drop was his Oyster card. At the entrance to the underground, he was confronted, stabbed, and bundled down the stairs. Most of the sixteen followed him into the underground station where, at the bottom of the stairs, the attack continued. The attack in the underground lasted about twelve seconds and the deceased was left fatally wounded with no less than nine stab wounds to his body as his attackers from the College group made their escape. Most of them ran to a bus stop in Buckingham Palace Road where they boarded a C10 bus. When police officers boarded the bus at the next bus stop, amongst other weapons and potential weapons, they found two particular knives which it was later ascertained had been used to stab the deceased. One was in a bag that belonged to Omoregie, and the other was wrapped in a newspaper that bore Nwokeh's fingerprints. It was the prosecution's case that an agreement had been in place to cause really serious harm to one or more of the West London group and that all went to Victoria knowing this to be the case, and knowing that most were armed with knives or other weapons. All contemplated that those weapons might actually be used, at least to cause really serious harm and some may have intended to kill or maim if the opportunity arose. When passing sentence, the judge identified the part played by each defendant based upon the verdicts of the jury and his assessment of the facts in the light of those verdicts, prefacing his remarks with the observation that this dreadful series of events at Victoria Station had its roots in the confrontation that had taken place the previous day and had taken place in front of horrified commuters. Explaining the role of Odegbune, Omoregie and Nwokeh convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, he said that, following the incident with Mensah, overnight and the following morning, there was communication between the groups in which Odegbune had played a principal role. He and the others involved expected trouble and he had made it clear that he had intended to come to college the next day armed with his samurai sword. Omoregie brought two chef's steels to the college and others came with variety of weapons. The expected violence was the talk of the college on the Thursday morning and afternoon. As no member of the opposing group came to the college that day the defendant group all expected the confrontation to take place at Victoria Station as they made their way home. They all travelled to Victoria expecting and intending trouble and they were prepared for it. Odegbune had with him the sword and both Omoregie and Nwokeh were each armed with the knives that were later found on the C10 bus. Thus, the judge concluded that Odegbune was a principal organiser of the entire incident and both Omoregie and Nwokeh were principals in the attack upon the deceased that followed. Odegbune had led the charge against the west London group with his sword shouting, ""We're going to fuck you up"". Although he was not part of the group that attacked and killed the deceased (having chased Andre Zaplatel), he was convicted of murder on the basis that he had intended that in the course of his attack on the opposing group someone should be killed or caused really serious bodily harm, or that he realised that such might be the consequence but nevertheless took part in the violence. The judge said that nobody who had seen the CCTV of the killing could possibly conclude that this was other than a ferocious and merciless attack upon the deceased and that there was any less than an intention to kill him. As for their antecedents, Odegbune had three minor convictions for which he had been placed on an action plan for three months, fined and made the subject of a two week curfew. A pre-sentence report noted his supportive family, his five GCSEs and the absence of evidence of any link to gangs. It was reported that he expressed remorse. He was considered as presenting a high risk to the public particularly towards young men of a similar age where a threat or injustice was detected. Omeregie and Nwokeh were both of previous good character. Omeregie had a supportive family and 9 GCSE passes all at grades A and B: he was studying for A levels. He was assessed as presenting a medium risk. Nwokeh had 6 GCSEs but revealed serious deficits in thinking and cognitive reasoning; he continued to deny guilt. There were positive aspects to their behaviour while in custody. For the crime of murder, the sentence was fixed by law and, as Odegbune and Omoregie had both been 16 and Nwokeh had been 17 at the date of the offence, the starting point for setting the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence was 12 years for each. The judge identified a number of aggravating factors. The first was the level of planning and premeditation. Second, they had gathered together for the purpose of serious mass violence in a busy public place at the height of the rush hour when they must have anticipated many innocent members of the public would be going about their lawful business. Third, they acted in a large group and the deceased was attacked by at least eight persons. Fourth, they carried and used weapons. Fifth, his assessment was that none of them had shown any kind of remorse nor had they acknowledged responsibility for the crime. It was in those circumstances that the minimum term was fixed at 18 years for each. In relation to Oderinwale, Roberts and Akra who had been convicted of manslaughter and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, the judge carefully analysed the evidence and expressed the basis for his sentence. He concluded that Roberts had kicked the deceased three times as he lay helpless upon the floor. His actions had been vicious and he had kicked the deceased's head with horrifying ferocity. Akra had admitted striking the deceased upon the neck with a chef's steel that he had obtained from Omoregie. Both Roberts and Akra stood convicted on the basis that they knew that at least one of their group was armed with a knife or other bladed weapon and that they foresaw that such a weapon might be used to cause some harm, albeit less that grievous bodily harm. Oderinwale had not been present at the scene of the attack but he had acted as armourer. He had been responsible for the purchase of a block of kitchen knives from Argos in Shepherds Bush in the early afternoon of 25 March. Some of those knives were used to kill the deceased. He was convicted on the basis that he had intentionally purchased, or assisted in the purchase, or distributed or assisted in the distribution of the knives realising that some harm, albeit short of grievous bodily harm, might be caused to another by the use of those knives or any of them. Oderinwale had also taken a principal part in the communications on Facebook and texting to set up the confrontation and thereby helped to initiate the conspiracy. There was no doubt that Roberts, Akra and Oderinwale had travelled to Victoria expecting the sort of violent confrontation, which in fact took place, and they were prepared to play their part in it. Oderinwale pursued members of the opposing group across Terminus Place and Akra and Roberts, joined the group of killers who set upon the deceased. Oderinwale had been an early member of the conspiracy. The judge accepted that Akra and Roberts had probably joined it later but, in relation to the offence of manslaughter, he concluded that there was no nothing to distinguish between them for sentencing purposes. All three of these young men were of good character with positive achievements. Oderinwale came from a supportive family and had 11 GCSEs at grates A to C; he was studying for A levels. Akra, with a supportive family and 9 GCSEs was also studying for A levels; there were four character references from his headmistress, two teachers and a teaching assistant. Roberts had 9 GCSEs and was in the first year of his A level course; he said his involvement had been spontaneous and impulsive, expressing sorrow for what he had done. In sentencing them the judge indicated that he had taken into account all these positive features, along with the way they had conducted themselves whilst in custody. Again a mitigating factor was their youth, at the time of the offences Oderinwale and Akra had been 16 and Roberts had been 17. In the circumstances, for the headline offence of manslaughter, they received determinate sentences of 12 years in a young offender institution. Turning to Amoah and Richards, both had been convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and violent disorder and, significantly, acquitted of any criminal complicity in the death of the deceased. Neither of them appeared to have become involved in the conspiracy until the 25 March 2010. Although Amoah had not been armed, once he arrived at Victoria station he joined the agreement hatched by others to cause grievous bodily harm to any one of the opposing group. He had joined the charge across the bus lanes of Terminus Place thereby placing many innocent members of the public in fear of violence. Amoah attended with his fellow students from St Charles' College whereas Richards (the youngest of the group and still at secondary school) had come to Victoria Station at the behest of Odegbune who, although of similar age, was his uncle (looked upon by him as a brother): his case was that he was concerned for Odegbune's welfare. He was seen to join the eventual charge across Terminus Place with something in his hand; the judge, however, concluded that it could not be safely determined that this had been a knife. Once again, both Amoah and Richards were of previous good character. In neither case was there evidence of any links to gangs. Amoah was from a supportive family and had 11 GCSEs; he was found to have poor assertive skills, impulsivity and limited knowledge of problem solving skills. He expressed remorse. Roberts lived with his mother and two younger brothers and was described as bright but under-achieving due to behavioural problems. The writer of the pre-sentence report concluded that his age and standing with his peers led him to be present at the scene. In each of their cases account was taken by the judge of their pre-sentence reports. With regard to Richards the offence was, he said, too serious to justify the imposition of a detention and training order; for the more serious offence of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm, each was sentenced to 7 years. In the case of Amoah, this was in a young offender institution; for Roberts it consisted of detention under Section 91 of the Act of 2000. The Relevant Principles As is well known, the sentence for murder is prescribed by law and is indeterminate (although expressed differently for offenders aged above 21, those between 18 and 21 and those under 18). In each case, however, Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 prescribes the approach to the determination of the minimum term which, linked to the age of the offender, is 'appropriate' to the seriousness of the offence. For adults above 21, the Act most grave offences of murder, described as having exceptionally high seriousness (e.g. the murder of a child which involved abduction or sexual or sadistic motivation) attract a starting point of 'whole life'; if an offender is over 18, where the seriousness of the offence is particularly high (e.g. murder that is racially aggravated), the starting point is 30 years. In other cases, for those over 18, the starting point was 15 years. In relation to a murder committed after 2 March 2010 (when para. 5A of Schedule 21 came into force: see Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Mandatory Life Sentence: Determination of Minimum Term) Order 2010 SI 2010 No 197), the starting point for those over 18 became 25 years where an offender used a knife or other weapon to commit the murder having it to the scene intending to commit any offence or have it available to use as a weapon. Assuming no other features took the case into the particularly or exceptionally high category, the starting point had previously been 15 years, although the planned use of a knife or other weapon would, in any event, have been an aggravating factor thereby increasing the ultimate sentence: see M [2010] 2 Cr App R (S) 117. The effect of this amendment of the law is twofold. First, it identifies a legislative intention to increase the minimum term imposed as part of the life sentence for murder committed with a knife or other weapon taken to the scene. It follows that, being faithful to the statutory framework, such sentences must now reflect the change of law; with the consequence that citation of reported decisions of sentences for similar offences committed prior to 2 March 2010 is unlikely to be helpful. Secondly, in order to preserve consistency of approach to sentencing across the range of offences, that change in respect of sentences for murder inevitably has an impact on lesser offences of violence committed with a knife or similar weapon: we return to this feature when considering sentences for manslaughter. With regard to the operation of the Schedule, it might appear to suggest that sentences upon those over 18 are stepped with minimum starting points at 15 years, 30 years and whole life. In reality, however, these steps merely provide the architecture or framework within which the judge must exercise discretion moving upwards or downwards depending on his or her assessment of the seriousness of the offence then being considered along with the aggravating or mitigating features. The result could be described not as a series of steps but, rather, as fixed points on a continuum which allows for an approach which is consistent with the legislative intent, but which allows the sentencing judge an appropriate discretion to balance the various features of the case in order to achieve a just result. In respect of those under the age of 18, similar principles apply. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 21 provides: ""If the offender was aged under 18 when he committed the offence, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 12 years."" In Attorney General's Reference No 126 of 206 (H) [2007] EWCA Crim 53 , [2007] 2 Cr App R (S) 59 page 362, Lord Judge CJ recognised that, even for those under 18, the appropriate sentence remained fact specific and had to be assessed having regard to features that, in an adult, would have moved the starting point to a higher level. He said (at para. 33) ""It is trite law but occasionally worth reminding ourselves that irrespective of the 'starting point', the end result may be a minimum sentence of 'any length', when appropriate, well below or well above the defined starting point. The court must take account of every aggravating and mitigating feature, with specific reference to those which are expressly identified in paras. 10 and 11 of the schedule. These lists are not exhaustive. In particular, we should emphasise that when the court is dealing with an offender aged under 18 years the provisions of para. 7 do not preclude the sentencer from reflecting on all the express features of the crime of murder identified in para. 4 and 5 of the schedule, and when they are found to be present from treating them as features which aggravate the offence."" As to the impact of para. 5A, in R v Moore [2010] EWCA Crim 2197, [2011] Cr App R (S) 94, page 561, it was argued that Parliament had left the starting point for those under 18 unchanged when raising it for those over 18 and must, therefore, have intended no change. In upholding a 17 year minimum term for a gang related murder (and additional wounding with intent) imposed on an offender who had pleaded guilty and was 16 at the time of the offences, Gross LJ observed that the court could ""readily understand"" why Parliament had not altered para. 7 of Schedule 21 observing that it had been ""left to the discretion of the judge to deal with as is just on the facts of the particular case"". We go further. It is well recognised, within the authorities, that those features which increase the starting point for offenders over 18 are, indeed, highly relevant as aggravating features when considering those under 18. We would emphatically endorse that principle. It is absurd to suggest, for example, that sexual motivation (which would increase the starting point in an offender over 18 from 15 to 30 years) should not be taken into account when sentencing those under 18. The same is so in relation to the use of weapons, taken to the scene and intended for use as para. 5A prescribes. Once again, however, being more prescriptive would undermine the ultimate aim of the legislation because the sentencing approach to a 12 year old convicted of murder will be very different to the approach to a 17 year old. It is next appropriate to turn to the offence of manslaughter. The starting point must be s. 143(1) of the 2003 Act which focuses on the very real significance of the consequences of an offence. It provides: ""In considering the seriousness of any offence, the court must consider the offender's culpability in committing the offence and any harm which the offence caused, was intended to cause or might foreseeably have caused."" As Lord Judge CJ said in R v Appleby [2010] 2 Cr App R (S) 46 , [2009] EWCA Crim 2693 (at para. 15), in relation to manslaughter, ""the culpability may be relatively low, but the harm caused is always at the highest level"". Lord Judge observed that reference to older authorities was no longer helpful and commented (at para. 22): ""[N]one of the decisions we have seen ... has proceeded on the basis which we have now addressed, that crimes which result in death should be treated more seriously, not so as to equate the sentencing in unlawful act manslaughter with sentences suggested in Schedule 21 to the 2003 Act, but so as to ensure that the increased focus on the fact that a victim has died in consequence of an unlawful act of violence, even where the conviction is for manslaughter, should, in accordance with the legislative intention, be given greater weight."" For the purposes of this appeal, it is necessary only to refer to cases involving the use of a weapon which, on any showing, is a seriously aggravating feature, particularly where (as here) there has been preparation and planning along with willingness to risk (even without intending to cause) serious bodily injury. An example of such a case without the planning (and involving a weapon albeit not a knife) was R v Preddie and Preddie [2007] EWCA Crim 1962, decided before Appleby and thus without the guidance there set out. Sentences of 8 years detention after convictions for manslaughter were upheld on two brothers aged 12 and 13 at the time of the killing (that is to say, markedly younger than the applicants in this case). They had confronted a 10 year old boy who was fatally stabbed in the leg with a broken beer bottle shard. Contrary to the facts of the present case, it is important to underline that the judge accepted the availability of the weapon was fortuitous: the bottle was already broken at the scene before the incident and not by anyone involved. The violence in Preddie was said to be bullying street violence even if there was no further underlying motive. Furthermore, the victim was left to die in circumstances when it must have been apparent that he had suffered serious injury. The main mitigating factor was the very young age of the Preddie brothers at the time of the incident, causing Latham LJ to observe (at para. 10): ""In the present context, we accept that we must approach it in the first instance by looking at the ages of these two appellants at the time of the offence. But it seems to us that we must and should reflect in our considerations the extent to which courts in these cases need to impose sentences which have a significant element of deterrence. There is no other way at the moment that the court can reflect the need to ensure the streets of this country are as safe as possible."" Those words apply equally to this case where the aggravating features are more serious. As to the harm caused, as the Lord Chief Justice observed, it is at the highest level. Culpability in this case is also high. In R v AM, Kika and Saddique [2009] EWCA Crim 2544 , Lord Judge CJ observed (at para. 9) that: "" anyone who goes into a public place armed with a knife or any other weapon and uses it to kill or to cause injury, and who is brought to justice, must anticipate condign punishment."" The deceased was attacked with knives, brought to the scene by a large group of teenagers who, at one stage, entered a conspiracy to cause really serious bodily injury even if, in the event, the jury were not sure (in the case of those convicted of manslaughter) that they intended or foresaw such harm actually being inflicted. Counsel have referred to a number of decisions in support of submissions that the sentences imposed for the homicide offences were manifestly excessive although, in our judgment, a historical analysis  even before the change in the law  does not support such a proposition. In R v Carter [2008] EWCA Crim 707 , a sentence of 10 years was upheld for manslaughter when a knife was used in a fight, the court rejecting (at para. 26) the proposition that there was a necessary distinction between cases where the verdict of manslaughter is based on provocation, unreasonable force going beyond self-defence or lack of intent to cause serious bodily harm. Reference was then made to the observations in R v Latham [1997] 2 Cr App R (S) 10, which concerned provocation manslaughter and three counts of wounding with intent (following a fight in a night club during which the offender produced and used a knife), when Kennedy LJ said: ""Even when a particular type of manslaughter is isolated from the rest it has to be recognised that it covers a wide field and if justice is to be done sentencers must not be put in straitjackets, but ... it seems to us that where an offender deliberately goes out with a knife, carrying it as a weapon, and uses it to cause death, even if there is provocation, he should expect to receive on conviction in a contested case a sentence in the region of 10-12 years."" R v Bishop [2011] EWCA 1225 is another case where this court declined to interfere with a 12 year sentence for manslaughter based on lack of intent imposed on a 26 year old of good character who stabbed the former partner (and father of the child) of his then partner following ongoing domestic difficulties. The circumstances were very different and although the court made reference to the need for appropriate sentences in knife crime, the offence was committed well before the change brought about by para. 5A of Schedule 21. The high water mark of the submissions is to be found in R v Yemoh & ors [2009] EWCA Crim 1775 . Although, again, obviously before the change of law (the offence having been committed in March 2007), it has certain factual similarities to this case. Two boys of 13 and 15 were convicted of the murder of a 16 year old boy; three other boys who were 13, 14 and 16 at the time of the killing, were convicted of manslaughter. The victim had been lured into a residential street for a one-on-one fight when he was set upon, threatened with a Stanley knife and stabbed with a knife or sharp implement. The judge spoke of a ""gang culture which casts its dreadful influence over so much of the youth of our inner cities"". He sentenced those convicted of murder (one of whom was of prior good character) to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure with minimum terms of 15 years. The three convicted of manslaughter (the 14 and 16 year olds with previous convictions including robbery or attempted robbery), received extended sentences 15 years with custodial terms of 10 years and extended licence of 5 years. This court concluded that the finding of premeditation of the type to which Schedule 21 refers was not made out but noted the aggravating features of the prolonged chase and attack, the possession of two knives and other weapons and the fact that ""these events took place in broad daylight in a residential street, to the horror of people going about their business"". A further aggravating feature for the 13 year old convicted of murder and two of those convicted of manslaughter had been involved in an earlier incident a month before involving a different youth. The mitigation included the extreme youth of the offenders and the fact that the intention was to cause serious harm only (rather than to kill). In the event, because of the different finding in relation to premeditation and giving due weight to the ages of the offenders, from the starting point of 12 years, increased to 15 years, the minimum term of those convicted of murder was reduced to 13 years. The sentences on the two convicted of manslaughter (involved in the previous incident) were reduced to extended terms of 13 years (of which 9 years was the custodial term and 4 years the extended licence) and the 13 year old of prior good character not involved in the earlier incident had his sentence reduced to an extended term of 11 years (being a custodial term of 8 years and an extended licence of 3 years). For our part, although we understand the parallels to which reference has been made, we do not consider that this decision governs (or necessarily impacts upon) this case and we were not surprised that Mr David Spens Q.C. (who had been one of those who had referred to this decision in the appeal documentation) disavowed reliance on it. The differences are obvious. This court specifically rejected the aggravating feature of premeditation and the offenders were very much younger: the younger the offender, necessarily, the greater the potential for a reduced assessment of culpability. Further, this decision did not take account of parliamentary intention to increase the sentences on those who participate in taking weapons to a scene and using them to kill. In relation to the offence of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm, the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council deals with non-fatal offences of violence and applies to all offenders aged 18 or over sentenced on or after 13 June 2011 (i.e. to each of these offenders save for Richards). It does not specifically deal with inchoate offences, but it is obviously relevant to examine the approach to sentencing the complete offence when dealing with attempts and conspiracy to commit that offence. The guideline is sufficiently flexible and capable of adjustment to reflect the differing circumstances and ensure consistency of approach. For those who were not convicted of murder or manslaughter, it is of critical importance to approach the issue of sentence without incorporating the fact of death into a conspiracy which carries with it an intention to cause really serious injury. For those who did not inflict the stabbing injury, the jury were directed to convict of manslaughter if sure that they were party to a joint enterprise to cause unlawful violence, knew that at least one of the attackers had a knife or other bladed instrument and knew that the attacker might use it to stab the victim intending to cause some injury or harm, but falling short of killing or causing really serious harm. Thus, the only proper interpretation of the verdicts of the jury in relation to those acquitted of murder and manslaughter but convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm is that the jury was sure of participation in an agreement to inflict grievous bodily harm on the opposing group in Victoria Station, they were not sure either that at least one of the attackers had a knife or other bladed instrument or, alternatively, did not realise that an attacker with a knife would or might use it to stab with intent to cause any injury. It goes without saying that for these offenders, the fatal injuries cannot be taken into account and the case must be considered on the basis of intended injury only; aggravating features could involve use of some sort of weapon (such as a shod foot) but not a knife. The useful parallel, therefore (which could be no more than that) could be with category 2; the starting point would be 6 years custody and the category range of 5 to 9 years. Aggravating and mitigating factors would then fall to be considered in the usual way. The Individual Appeals and Applications Christopher Omeregi and Obi Nwokeh We deal first with those convicted of murder. Mr George Payne for Omoregie and Mr Jerome Lynch Q.C. for Nwokeh argue that the learned judge erred in concluding that there was an intention to kill, as opposed to an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. They argued that this interpretation of events did not accord with the verdicts of the jury. Of the 8 youths in the ticket hall, said to be acting as one group, only 2 were convicted of murder and the others of manslaughter. It must be concluded therefore, that the jury did not conclude that there was a group intention to kill. It was the case for the prosecution that Omoregie and Nwokeh had themselves attacked the deceased with knives and it was contended that, having regard to the acts recorded on CCTV along with the nature and location of the injuries described by the pathologist, the intention could only have been to kill. The judge was of the same view and expressed described the attack as ""ferocious and merciless"", a view we share having seen for ourselves the CCTV images. He conducted the trial and was in the best position to make his assessment, consistent with the verdicts of the jury, of the intentions of each offender and he was entitled to do so. We have dealt with the further argument raised by Mr Jerome Lynch Q.C. on behalf of Nwokeh relating to Yemoh above. Although we recognise that for these young men, the sentences imposed may appear to them to be overwhelming in length, the need to punish and deter others made them inevitable. From a starting point of 12 years, these offences were seriously aggravated not only by the planning and premeditation for mass violence in public at the height of the rush hour but also the participation as one of a large group involved in attacking the deceased with weapons brought for the purpose and so effectively used. Youth was encompassed by the reduced starting point (which would otherwise have been 25 years) and the mitigation and positive aspects of these applicants' characters were recognised. The sentences were neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive: these applications are refused. Samson Odegbune The appeal of Odegbune in relation to his sentence for murder raises slightly different issues. First, Mr Robert Marshall Andrews Q.C. argues that the only feature aggravating the offence above the starting point of 12 years was the degree of pre-planning but that this had to be seen in the light of the serious, acknowledged and accepted threats by the aggressive group described as GFL (including the suggestion of a gun possibly being available) whereas there is no reference to these crucial elements in the sentencing remarks. It is, however, clear that, following the verdicts of the jury, the judge rejected any element of self defence but concluded that this was a planned confrontation. In any event, this was not the only feature aggravating the offence: as we have analysed the principles involved, the use of weapons brought to the scene very seriously aggravates the offence above the starting point prescribed in the legislation. He also submits that in asserting that Odegbune, along with the others convicted of murder, showed no remorse, the judge ignored the statement to that effect in the pre-sentence report: the judge had, of course, been able to observe this appellant throughout the very lengthy trial: he was not bound by the view of the probation officer after conviction. As for his academic success and progress, he said in terms that he had taken account of all that had been advanced on behalf of the appellant ""and the positive aspects of your conduct while in custody"". In our judgment, Mr Marshall Andrews' strongest point concerned the basis upon which Odegbune was sentenced, namely, the intention to kill attributed to the primary participants to the violent stabbing. Whatever steps he had taken to organise and orchestrate the violent confrontation, it is argued that he had taken no actual part in any violence aimed at the deceased but had led a different contingent (albeit brandishing a samurai sword and shouting, as the judge found, ""We're going to fuck you up""), inflicting no injury at all. The jury clearly (and, by dismissing the application for leave to appeal against conviction, we have concluded safely) found that his role as the leader of the conspiracy also encompassed his intention or foresight that one or more of the conspirators would use a knife or knives to kill or cause really serious injury. Although it created no inconsistency of verdict, however, we accept that there was not the same material in his case (compared to the cases of those who engaged directly in the attack) to justify concluding that he had an intention to kill. We agree with Mr Marshall Andrews that it is appropriate to read the sentencing remarks in that way. Having said that, however, had the judge concluded that the extent of Odegnune's responsibility for the entire incident through the leadership which he had shown in its organisation and in leading the charge meant that, even though he had not been part of the murderous attack, his responsibility was the same as those killing with intention to kill, the court might well have taken the view that the conclusion was not one with which it ought to interfere. He did not, however, say that. On the basis that he could not attribute to Odegbune an intention to kill, recognising that the conviction for murder was clearly a consequence of his leadership role, it is important that there is no double counting. In the circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that the judge should have differentiated slightly between those who carried knives to the scene and, with the intention to kill, no doubt formed in the heat of the moment, caused death; and that of Odegbune who might have played a far greater role in the organisation of the confrontation but in respect of whom it cannot be said that he intended death, however great the risk of that outcome. In the circumstances, the minimum term in his case is reduced by 2 years to 16 years. Adonis Junior Akra Turning to those convicted of manslaughter, on behalf of Akra, Mr David Spens Q.C. submits that the starting point for the murderers was too high and thus those convicted of manslaughter should similarly have their sentences reviewed. We have considered the principles in the analysis above and have no doubt that, as the law presently stands, it was not. Similarly, the general approach to the manslaughter sentences (bearing in mind the harm and the impact of the approach to homicide) cannot be faulted. He also submitted that the judge had failed to reflect the different roles played by each of those convicted of manslaughter, suggesting that Akra's role was no more serious than that of Oderinwale or Roberts but clearly less serious than that of Osoteku, an 18 year old girl who had played a key role in arming the murderers and delivered the final kick to the deceased. Responding to the Grounds of Appeal, the single judge put it this way: ""This was a group conspiracy and a group action. Although there were differences in the precise role and involvement of different defendants the Judge was entitled to take view that a consistent approach should be adopted with the same sentences being imposed for similar offending. Further, any differences which could be argued for in relation to the applicant would not render his sentence manifestly excessive either in itself or when compared to that of others. The applicant was one of the group of killers, was armed and struck the victim. ... Further, given the public nature of the offending, a fatal, mass charge and attack with the brandishing and use of knives taking place at Victoria station during rush hour, the Judge would have been justified in including a deterrent element in his sentencing."" We agree with these remarks. The need for a deterrent sentence is undeniable and, even making every allowance for the antecedents, background and references which this applicant has amassed (and paying tribute to the very positive aspects of his character which we have no doubt will serve him well in the future), in the light of all the circumstances, it is impossible to say that the sentence imposed was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive. This application is refused. Femi Oderinwale Mr Corsellis for Oderinwale argues that the sentences imposed for murder were arguably manifestly excessive so that the sentences for manslaughter ought to be adjusted: we have rejected the premise and this argument falls. He also submits that the starting point for manslaughter was too high and failed to reflect the role Oderinwale played. In addition to the authorities set out above, he also cites R v Bishop [2011] EWCA Crim 1225 but that decision is not, as he submits, authority approving Carter . Carter was cited but the decision of the court (per Davis J as he then was) was simply that the sentence imposed in the case under appeal (12 years) could not be challenged. In any event, that killing took place before the change in the law. It is also argued that the judge failed to take account of the genuine fear of attack (dealt with above) or the fact that a plea to manslaughter had been offered. This last is no mitigation unless the plea is openly tendered in court and before the jury, which this was not. To suggest that such would be unrealistic where the defence being run was lack of knowledge of weapons, lack of specific intent to injure and chasing his perceived attackers away is to underline that no admission was, in fact, being made to the crime of manslaughter. The delay following conviction (before the judge could deal with all the offenders in one sentencing hearing) was a regrettable consequence of the nature of the crime: it does not justify a reduction in sentence. Finally, Mr Corsellis recognised that the 8 year sentence for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm was fully merited, but that the fact that his role came to an end before the events at Victoria Station should have led to a lesser sentence for manslaughter. We do not agree. The sentence for conspiracy did not reflect the fact that the knives he acquired were used in the subsequent attack and that fatal injury resulted. In his case, that fact was a necessary ingredient to be recognised in the ultimate sentence for manslaughter. Once again, we agree with the remarks of the single judge when he refused this application, expressed in these terms: ""The applicant played a key role in the conspiracy and helped initiate it. He took a principal part in the communications the previous evening which involved getting ""tooled up"" and contemplated their adversaries getting ""slumped"" (killed). He then acted as armourer for the group. He was responsible for the purchase of kitchen knives from Argos, some of which were used to kill the victim. Although there was a responsive element to the conspiracy the Judge found that the group travelled to Victoria expecting and intending trouble and prepared and armed for it. Even if the jury's manslaughter verdict indicates a subsequent intent to cause lesser injury, death was a foreseeable and actual consequence of the conspiracy of which the applicant was convicted. The applicant was part of the mass charge across Terminus Place although he did not join in the attack on the victim. He was pursuing others. He was convicted on the basis that he intentionally purchased or assisted in the purchase of knives, or distributed or assisted in the distribution of those knives, realising that some harm might result."" Samuel Junior Roberts On behalf of Roberts, Mr Benn Maguire also submits that the judge failed to distinguish between the parts played by those convicted of manslaughter. Roberts had played no part in the planning, joined the conspiracy on the spur of the moment and did not have a weapon. On the other hand, Roberts was convicted on the basis that he knew that at least one of the group was armed with a knife or other bladed weapon and foresaw it might be used to cause some harm. Second, although not using a knife (which would doubtless have led to a conviction for murder), he utilised another weapon, namely his shod foot. In that regard, it is worth repeating the observations of the learned judge. He said: ""No one who has seen the CCTV images of the scene could fail to be horrified by the ferocity of one of the kicks you delivered to the head of the deceased - it was if you were kicking a rugby football. Your action were vicious and victim, defenceless."" The single judge repeated the observations about group conspiracy and group action that he had made in relation to the application by Akra, observing that Roberts was one of a group of killers who viciously and repeatedly kicked the victim. The trial judge specifically said that he had reflected his youth, his antecedents and his behaviour in custody. In our judgment, this deterrent sentence is not arguably wrong in principle or manifestly excessive and this application is refused. Tyrone Richards and Enoch Charles Amoah These cases can be considered together. In both cases, each appellant was acquitted of any involvement in the homicide but convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. The distinguishing feature in their cases was that each had joined the conspiracy hatched by others only at Victoria Station; they then joined in the mass, armed charge across Terminus Place which placed so many members of the public in fear but they were neither armed nor part of the attack on the victim (although Richards had some article in his hand the nature of which the judge expressed himself as unable to determine). The first ground of appeal is that the judge passed the same sentence for conspiracy on these appellants as he had on most of those convicted of homicide offences. This ignores the fact that these were all concurrent terms to longer sentences, but the point is fairly made that the judge failed to distinguish between their parts and that played by the other offenders. For Richards, Mr Garry Green argues that, given the offences of which he had been convicted, more attention could be paid to the fact that he was the youngest of the group, whose involvement was expressed to assist his uncle (Odegbune); he was of good character and positive antecedents. Furthermore, he remained under 18 and sentencing principles required consideration for his welfare and the aim of reducing offending. For Amoah, Mr Charles Sherrard Q.C. submits that this was more of a notional conspiracy than involvement by physically playing a role which assisted others: it was critical to have regard to precisely what he did which was to join in as he got off the bus, run the 200-300 yards and then leave (without going down the steps into the station). Mr Sherrard referred to R v Thomas & others [2010] EWCA Crim 148 in which extended sentences of 8 years (comprising custodial terms of 4 years with extended licences of 4 years) were passed on two offenders in circumstances which he contended were more serious than these. We derive no assistance from the case which is no more than an example of a sentence passed at first instance: those offenders did not appeal this sentence for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm but only the concurrent identical (and unlawful) term for violent disorder. It has no authoritative value whatsoever and, in any event, was prior to the issue of guidance by the Sentencing Council intended to reflect an increase in sentences for the most serious non-fatal offences of violence, namely causing grievous bodily harm with intent and wounding with intent consequent upon the increased seriousness that Parliament had accorded to murder and, thus, homicide generally (as demonstrated by the cases to which we have referred). Using the guideline analogously, however, we see force in the submission that for this offence of conspiracy, by these appellants, with the more limited involvement identified by the judge, a different approach was justified from that adopted for those convicted of homicide, especially in the case of Richards. In our judgment, the sentences imposed did not adequately reflect this very different position which, bearing in mind their youth, good character and positive reports did not need to be as long as 7 years. Although we can see an argument for distinguishing between the two because of their different ages, in the end, we have felt it appropriate to defer to the view of the trial judge (who, we repeat, had the opportunity of assessing each offender over the weeks of the trial) and have decided not to do so. Although the limited role that Amoah and Richards played must be reflected in the sentence imposed, any participation in public violence of this nature, involving an intention to cause really serious harm, must inevitably be treated very seriously. In the circumstances, we quash the sentences of 7 years respectively of detention and in a young offender institution and impose sentences of 5½ years in their place. Conclusion The judge had a very difficult sentencing exercise to perform and nothing we have said should be taken as critical of the attention to which he paid to it; we also pay tribute to the careful analysis provided by the single judge. Standing back and reviewing the approach against the backdrop of the entire case and in the light of the arguments now advanced, we have come to the conclusion that the appeal of Odegbune should be allowed: the sentence of detention at Her Majesty's pleasure remains but the minimum term which he must serve is reduced from 18 years to 16 years simply on the basis that, although his leading role must be underlined (and doubtless led to his conviction for murder), the finding of a specific intention to kill in his case cannot be sustained. It is important to repeat that the passage of this period will not necessarily mean his release: he will only be released when the parole board consider that he does not represent a risk to the public and it is safe to do so. The appeals of Richards and Amoah will similarly be allowed: the periods of 7 years detention under s. 91 of the 2000 Act (in relation to Richards) and in a young offender institution (in relation to Amoah) are quashed and periods of 5½ years detention substituted. No other adjustment to the sentences is appropriate; the remaining renewed applications for leave to appeal against sentence are refused. We cannot leave this case without commenting on the devastation that this terrible incident has caused to so many lives. At the top of the list, by far, is the fact that a 15 year old schoolboy, Sofyen Belamouadden, lost his life and all that it held for him. We have read the impact statements that his parents have provided and we have no doubt that they, their remaining children and their wider family and friends have suffered enormously from the devastation of his death: this loss will scar the family's lives forever. Albeit entirely self inflicted, it is also worth pointing out that a dozen or so young people of prior good character with academic achievement and promise have also blighted their own lives and impacted on the lives of those who have been supportive of them. The account of this case should be told and repeated to young people everywhere: knives kill people and the effect of the madness of a few hours  or of a moment  will ripple out and destroy or devastate many lives. That is why the courts will and must always place punishment and deterrence at the forefront of any sentencing decision is cases such as these.

He was caught at the top of the stairs to Victoria underground where he was attacked with bladed weapons, causing at least one cutting injury before he fell down the stairs into the ticket hall of the underground station. Whilst he was on the ground, a core group of those who had chased him ran down the stairs and effected a combined and lethal attack upon him. This included stabbing or cutting him with knives, kicking and punching him with force. The result was that Sofyen Belamouadden (to whom we shall now refer as the deceased) died. The case has presented the criminal justice system with very real challenges. In the event, at the Central Criminal Court, His Honour Judge Christopher Moss Q.C. conducted no fewer than five trials (which also encompassed re-trials following jury disagreement). In the first trial, on 16 May 2011, Christopher Omoregi (now 19) and Obi Nwokeh (now 20) were convicted of murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; Adonis Junior Akra (now 19), Femi Oderinwale (now 19) and Samuel Junior Roberts (now 20) were convicted of manslaughter and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; and Enoch Charles Amoah (now 20) was convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. In the second trial, on 11 August 2011, Samson Odegbune (now 19) was convicted of murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; and Tyrone Richards (now 18) was convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. Richards was acquitted of murder upon the judge's direction; Amoah, Akra, Oderinwale and Roberts had each been charged with murder, the jury returning convictions for the lesser offence of manslaughter. On 20 April 2012, the judge proceeded to sentence all offenders. Each of those convicted of murder (Omeregi, Nwokeh and Odegbune) was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure with a minimum term specified of 18 years and concurrent terms of 8 years detention in a young offender institution for conspiracy. Those convicted of manslaughter (Akra, Oderinwale and Roberts) received sentences of 12 years detention in a young offender institution; Akra and Roberts were sentenced to concurrent terms of 7 years detention for conspiracy; Oderinwale received 8 years concurrent for the same offence. Finally, Amoah was sentenced to 7 years detention in a young offender institution for conspiracy with a concurrent term of 3 years for violent disorder; Richards similarly received 7 years detention (in his case under s. 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000) with no separate penalty for violent disorder. In each case, time served was ordered to count. Odegbune, Amoah and Richards all appeal against sentence by leave of the single judge; Omeregi, Nwokeh, Akra, Oderinwale and Roberts all seek to renew their applications following refusal of leave. It is appropriate to mention the others charged in connection with this incident. In separate trials Victoria Osoteku and Junior Bayode were convicted of manslaughter. Osoteku was sentenced to 12 years in a young offender institution with a concurrent term of 8 years for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm; for reasons which are irrelevant to this application, Bayode has not yet been sentenced. Chris Goncalves, Tayo Emmanuel Ajayi and Amari Wood were convicted after a retrial of violent disorder and received 30 months, 30 months and 27 months respectively in a young offender institution; Lewis Ryan Sinclair, Olawale Olaribigbe, Selassie Ahiaku, and Melvin Mensah were sentenced to 2 years in a young offender institution following their guilty pleas to offences of violent disorder. The Facts The background was the simmering tension between pupils at St Charles' Catholic Sixth Form College (""the College group"") and their associates, and others, predominantly from Hammersmith and Fulham (""the West London group""). There is no suggestion that the College group were other than a collection of individuals attending the college. It was forcefully contended on their behalf, however that the West London group constituted a street gang, known as GFL, short for ""Gangsters for Life"" or, possibly, ""Guns for Life"": it was said that they presented with a reputation for violence and confrontation. At some prior to 24 March 2010, there had been an incident at a party in relation to a girl between members of the two groups (in which Odegbune was involved). On 24 March 2010, members of the College saw two members of the West London group (Raheem Keane and Andre Willis) in the food hall at Victoria Station. There was a short confrontation the upshot of which was that Melvin Mensah (from the College) received a bloody nose: Keane and Willis (one of whom shouted a threat although not one which was heard by the College youths) ended up being arrested for a short while. Following this fight, there was clear evidence that the College group and the West London group envisaged another confrontation the following day: Mr Heywood described both sides as being involved in a pre-planned pitched encounter. Members of the College group communicated with one another using Facebook and mobile phones, as did the West London group. There was also communication between the groups, initially through intermediaries but eventually by contact (said by the Crown to be 'leader to leader') between Odegbune and Keane. Suffice to say, there was a considerable body of evidence showing the extent of such contact. It was said that the West London group would either be coming up to the College or would be at Victoria Station that afternoon. Once at college, on Thursday 25 March, the College group made more specific arrangements which amounted to a conspiracy to engage in an armed confrontation with the West London group later that day and to use weapons to cause grievous bodily harm. In the event, during the course of the day, the location for the planned encounter was confirmed as Victoria Station. The College group went to Victoria Station on 25 March on two buses, and arrived at the height of the rush hour and in broad daylight. Between them, they were heavily armed with an array of knives, including a set of kitchen knives specifically purchased for the purpose that afternoon. Although it was said that they had to pass through Victoria Station on their way home (whereas the West London group did not), the College group congregated and waited at the end of Terminus Place on the corner furthest away from where they would have alighted from their bus and then continued their journey. Many were in dark clothing with hoods or hats. Shortly thereafter, the West London group appeared at the opposite end of Terminus Place. That group were no doubt also ready and one was seen with his hands aloft saying ""Come on"". That confrontation commenced with Odegbune leading a charge of all those who subsequently became defendants chasing the West London group through Terminus Place, with weapons displayed. Odegbune himself was brandishing a samurai sword in front of him. Thereafter, the College group split with Odegbune, Richards, Oderinwale and others chasing Andre Zaplatel (one of the victim group) through Terminus Place. The other sixteen defendants chased the deceased who was associated with the West London group. By this time, he was isolated. As he approached the entrance to the underground station, he tripped and fell over a kerb stone, and his pursuers caught up with him. As events subsequently proved, the deceased was unarmed: what he was seen to drop was his Oyster card. At the entrance to the underground, he was confronted, stabbed, and bundled down the stairs. Most of the sixteen followed him into the underground station where, at the bottom of the stairs, the attack continued. The attack in the underground lasted about twelve seconds and the deceased was left fatally wounded with no less than nine stab wounds to his body as his attackers from the College group made their escape. Most of them ran to a bus stop in Buckingham Palace Road where they boarded a C10 bus. When police officers boarded the bus at the next bus stop, amongst other weapons and potential weapons, they found two particular knives which it was later ascertained had been used to stab the deceased. One was in a bag that belonged to Omoregie, and the other was wrapped in a newspaper that bore Nwokeh's fingerprints. It was the prosecution's case that an agreement had been in place to cause really serious harm to one or more of the West London group and that all went to Victoria knowing this to be the case, and knowing that most were armed with knives or other weapons. All contemplated that those weapons might actually be used, at least to cause really serious harm and some may have intended to kill or maim if the opportunity arose. When passing sentence, the judge identified the part played by each defendant based upon the verdicts of the jury and his assessment of the facts in the light of those verdicts, prefacing his remarks with the observation that this dreadful series of events at Victoria Station had its roots in the confrontation that had taken place the previous day and had taken place in front of horrified commuters. Explaining the role of Odegbune, Omoregie and Nwokeh convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, he said that, following the incident with Mensah, overnight and the following morning, there was communication between the groups in which Odegbune had played a principal role. He and the others involved expected trouble and he had made it clear that he had intended to come to college the next day armed with his samurai sword. Omoregie brought two chef's steels to the college and others came with variety of weapons. The expected violence was the talk of the college on the Thursday morning and afternoon. As no member of the opposing group came to the college that day the defendant group all expected the confrontation to take place at Victoria Station as they made their way home. They all travelled to Victoria expecting and intending trouble and they were prepared for it. Odegbune had with him the sword and both Omoregie and Nwokeh were each armed with the knives that were later found on the C10 bus. Thus, the judge concluded that Odegbune was a principal organiser of the entire incident and both Omoregie and Nwokeh were principals in the attack upon the deceased that followed. Odegbune had led the charge against the west London group with his sword shouting, ""We're going to fuck you up"". Although he was not part of the group that attacked and killed the deceased (having chased Andre Zaplatel), he was convicted of murder on the basis that he had intended that in the course of his attack on the opposing group someone should be killed or caused really serious bodily harm, or that he realised that such might be the consequence but nevertheless took part in the violence. The judge said that nobody who had seen the CCTV of the killing could possibly conclude that this was other than a ferocious and merciless attack upon the deceased and that there was any less than an intention to kill him. As for their antecedents, Odegbune had three minor convictions for which he had been placed on an action plan for three months, fined and made the subject of a two week curfew. A pre-sentence report noted his supportive family, his five GCSEs and the absence of evidence of any link to gangs. It was reported that he expressed remorse. He was considered as presenting a high risk to the public particularly towards young men of a similar age where a threat or injustice was detected. Omeregie and Nwokeh were both of previous good character. Omeregie had a supportive family and 9 GCSE passes all at grades A and B: he was studying for A levels. He was assessed as presenting a medium risk. Nwokeh had 6 GCSEs but revealed serious deficits in thinking and cognitive reasoning; he continued to deny guilt. There were positive aspects to their behaviour while in custody. For the crime of murder, the sentence was fixed by law and, as Odegbune and Omoregie had both been 16 and Nwokeh had been 17 at the date of the offence, the starting point for setting the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence was 12 years for each. The judge identified a number of aggravating factors. The first was the level of planning and premeditation. Second, they had gathered together for the purpose of serious mass violence in a busy public place at the height of the rush hour when they must have anticipated many innocent members of the public would be going about their lawful business. Third, they acted in a large group and the deceased was attacked by at least eight persons. Fourth, they carried and used weapons. Fifth, his assessment was that none of them had shown any kind of remorse nor had they acknowledged responsibility for the crime. It was in those circumstances that the minimum term was fixed at 18 years for each. In relation to Oderinwale, Roberts and Akra who had been convicted of manslaughter and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, the judge carefully analysed the evidence and expressed the basis for his sentence. He concluded that Roberts had kicked the deceased three times as he lay helpless upon the floor. His actions had been vicious and he had kicked the deceased's head with horrifying ferocity. Akra had admitted striking the deceased upon the neck with a chef's steel that he had obtained from Omoregie. Both Roberts and Akra stood convicted on the basis that they knew that at least one of their group was armed with a knife or other bladed weapon and that they foresaw that such a weapon might be used to cause some harm, albeit less that grievous bodily harm. Oderinwale had not been present at the scene of the attack but he had acted as armourer. He had been responsible for the purchase of a block of kitchen knives from Argos in Shepherds Bush in the early afternoon of 25 March. Some of those knives were used to kill the deceased. He was convicted on the basis that he had intentionally purchased, or assisted in the purchase, or distributed or assisted in the distribution of the knives realising that some harm, albeit short of grievous bodily harm, might be caused to another by the use of those knives or any of them. Oderinwale had also taken a principal part in the communications on Facebook and texting to set up the confrontation and thereby helped to initiate the conspiracy. There was no doubt that Roberts, Akra and Oderinwale had travelled to Victoria expecting the sort of violent confrontation, which in fact took place, and they were prepared to play their part in it. Oderinwale pursued members of the opposing group across Terminus Place and Akra and Roberts, joined the group of killers who set upon the deceased. Oderinwale had been an early member of the conspiracy. The judge accepted that Akra and Roberts had probably joined it later but, in relation to the offence of manslaughter, he concluded that there was no nothing to distinguish between them for sentencing purposes. All three of these young men were of good character with positive achievements. Oderinwale came from a supportive family and had 11 GCSEs at grates A to C; he was studying for A levels. Akra, with a supportive family and 9 GCSEs was also studying for A levels; there were four character references from his headmistress, two teachers and a teaching assistant. Roberts had 9 GCSEs and was in the first year of his A level course; he said his involvement had been spontaneous and impulsive, expressing sorrow for what he had done. In sentencing them the judge indicated that he had taken into account all these positive features, along with the way they had conducted themselves whilst in custody. Again a mitigating factor was their youth, at the time of the offences Oderinwale and Akra had been 16 and Roberts had been 17. In the circumstances, for the headline offence of manslaughter, they received determinate sentences of 12 years in a young offender institution. Turning to Amoah and Richards, both had been convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and violent disorder and, significantly, acquitted of any criminal complicity in the death of the deceased. Neither of them appeared to have become involved in the conspiracy until the 25 March 2010. Although Amoah had not been armed, once he arrived at Victoria station he joined the agreement hatched by others to cause grievous bodily harm to any one of the opposing group. He had joined the charge across the bus lanes of Terminus Place thereby placing many innocent members of the public in fear of violence. Amoah attended with his fellow students from St Charles' College whereas Richards (the youngest of the group and still at secondary school) had come to Victoria Station at the behest of Odegbune who, although of similar age, was his uncle (looked upon by him as a brother): his case was that he was concerned for Odegbune's welfare. He was seen to join the eventual charge across Terminus Place with something in his hand; the judge, however, concluded that it could not be safely determined that this had been a knife. Once again, both Amoah and Richards were of previous good character. In neither case was there evidence of any links to gangs. Amoah was from a supportive family and had 11 GCSEs; he was found to have poor assertive skills, impulsivity and limited knowledge of problem solving skills. He expressed remorse. Roberts lived with his mother and two younger brothers and was described as bright but under-achieving due to behavioural problems. The writer of the pre-sentence report concluded that his age and standing with his peers led him to be present at the scene. In each of their cases account was taken by the judge of their pre-sentence reports. With regard to Richards the offence was, he said, too serious to justify the imposition of a detention and training order; for the more serious offence of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm, each was sentenced to 7 years. In the case of Amoah, this was in a young offender institution; for Roberts it consisted of detention under Section 91 of the Act of 2000. The Relevant Principles As is well known, the sentence for murder is prescribed by law and is indeterminate (although expressed differently for offenders aged above 21, those between 18 and 21 and those under 18). In each case, however, Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 prescribes the approach to the determination of the minimum term which, linked to the age of the offender, is 'appropriate' to the seriousness of the offence. For adults above 21, the Act most grave offences of murder, described as having exceptionally high seriousness (e.g. the murder of a child which involved abduction or sexual or sadistic motivation) attract a starting point of 'whole life'; if an offender is over 18, where the seriousness of the offence is particularly high (e.g. murder that is racially aggravated), the starting point is 30 years. In other cases, for those over 18, the starting point was 15 years. In relation to a murder committed after 2 March 2010 (when para. 5A of Schedule 21 came into force: see Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Mandatory Life Sentence: Determination of Minimum Term) Order 2010 SI 2010 No 197), the starting point for those over 18 became 25 years where an offender used a knife or other weapon to commit the murder having it to the scene intending to commit any offence or have it available to use as a weapon. Assuming no other features took the case into the particularly or exceptionally high category, the starting point had previously been 15 years, although the planned use of a knife or other weapon would, in any event, have been an aggravating factor thereby increasing the ultimate sentence: see M [2010] 2 Cr App R (S) 117. The effect of this amendment of the law is twofold. First, it identifies a legislative intention to increase the minimum term imposed as part of the life sentence for murder committed with a knife or other weapon taken to the scene. It follows that, being faithful to the statutory framework, such sentences must now reflect the change of law; with the consequence that citation of reported decisions of sentences for similar offences committed prior to 2 March 2010 is unlikely to be helpful. Secondly, in order to preserve consistency of approach to sentencing across the range of offences, that change in respect of sentences for murder inevitably has an impact on lesser offences of violence committed with a knife or similar weapon: we return to this feature when considering sentences for manslaughter. With regard to the operation of the Schedule, it might appear to suggest that sentences upon those over 18 are stepped with minimum starting points at 15 years, 30 years and whole life. In reality, however, these steps merely provide the architecture or framework within which the judge must exercise discretion moving upwards or downwards depending on his or her assessment of the seriousness of the offence then being considered along with the aggravating or mitigating features. The result could be described not as a series of steps but, rather, as fixed points on a continuum which allows for an approach which is consistent with the legislative intent, but which allows the sentencing judge an appropriate discretion to balance the various features of the case in order to achieve a just result. In respect of those under the age of 18, similar principles apply. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 21 provides: ""If the offender was aged under 18 when he committed the offence, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 12 years."" In Attorney General's Reference No 126 of 206 (H) [2007] EWCA Crim 53 , [2007] 2 Cr App R (S) 59 page 362, Lord Judge CJ recognised that, even for those under 18, the appropriate sentence remained fact specific and had to be assessed having regard to features that, in an adult, would have moved the starting point to a higher level. He said (at para. 33) ""It is trite law but occasionally worth reminding ourselves that irrespective of the 'starting point', the end result may be a minimum sentence of 'any length', when appropriate, well below or well above the defined starting point. The court must take account of every aggravating and mitigating feature, with specific reference to those which are expressly identified in paras. 10 and 11 of the schedule. These lists are not exhaustive. In particular, we should emphasise that when the court is dealing with an offender aged under 18 years the provisions of para. 7 do not preclude the sentencer from reflecting on all the express features of the crime of murder identified in para. 4 and 5 of the schedule, and when they are found to be present from treating them as features which aggravate the offence."" As to the impact of para. 5A, in R v Moore [2010] EWCA Crim 2197, [2011] Cr App R (S) 94, page 561, it was argued that Parliament had left the starting point for those under 18 unchanged when raising it for those over 18 and must, therefore, have intended no change. In upholding a 17 year minimum term for a gang related murder (and additional wounding with intent) imposed on an offender who had pleaded guilty and was 16 at the time of the offences, Gross LJ observed that the court could ""readily understand"" why Parliament had not altered para. 7 of Schedule 21 observing that it had been ""left to the discretion of the judge to deal with as is just on the facts of the particular case"". We go further. It is well recognised, within the authorities, that those features which increase the starting point for offenders over 18 are, indeed, highly relevant as aggravating features when considering those under 18. We would emphatically endorse that principle. It is absurd to suggest, for example, that sexual motivation (which would increase the starting point in an offender over 18 from 15 to 30 years) should not be taken into account when sentencing those under 18. The same is so in relation to the use of weapons, taken to the scene and intended for use as para. 5A prescribes. Once again, however, being more prescriptive would undermine the ultimate aim of the legislation because the sentencing approach to a 12 year old convicted of murder will be very different to the approach to a 17 year old. It is next appropriate to turn to the offence of manslaughter. The starting point must be s. 143(1) of the 2003 Act which focuses on the very real significance of the consequences of an offence. It provides: ""In considering the seriousness of any offence, the court must consider the offender's culpability in committing the offence and any harm which the offence caused, was intended to cause or might foreseeably have caused."" As Lord Judge CJ said in R v Appleby [2010] 2 Cr App R (S) 46 , [2009] EWCA Crim 2693 (at para. 15), in relation to manslaughter, ""the culpability may be relatively low, but the harm caused is always at the highest level"". Lord Judge observed that reference to older authorities was no longer helpful and commented (at para. 22): "" one of the decisions we have seen ... has proceeded on the basis which we have now addressed, that crimes which result in death should be treated more seriously, not so as to equate the sentencing in unlawful act manslaughter with sentences suggested in Schedule 21 to the 2003 Act, but so as to ensure that the increased focus on the fact that a victim has died in consequence of an unlawful act of violence, even where the conviction is for manslaughter, should, in accordance with the legislative intention, be given greater weight."" For the purposes of this appeal, it is necessary only to refer to cases involving the use of a weapon which, on any showing, is a seriously aggravating feature, particularly where (as here) there has been preparation and planning along with willingness to risk (even without intending to cause) serious bodily injury. An example of such a case without the planning (and involving a weapon albeit not a knife) was R v Preddie and Preddie [2007] EWCA Crim 1962, decided before Appleby and thus without the guidance there set out. Sentences of 8 years detention after convictions for manslaughter were upheld on two brothers aged 12 and 13 at the time of the killing (that is to say, markedly younger than the applicants in this case). They had confronted a 10 year old boy who was fatally stabbed in the leg with a broken beer bottle shard. Contrary to the facts of the present case, it is important to underline that the judge accepted the availability of the weapon was fortuitous: the bottle was already broken at the scene before the incident and not by anyone involved. The violence in Preddie was said to be bullying street violence even if there was no further underlying motive. Furthermore, the victim was left to die in circumstances when it must have been apparent that he had suffered serious injury. The main mitigating factor was the very young age of the Preddie brothers at the time of the incident, causing Latham LJ to observe (at para. 10): ""In the present context, we accept that we must approach it in the first instance by looking at the ages of these two appellants at the time of the offence. But it seems to us that we must and should reflect in our considerations the extent to which courts in these cases need to impose sentences which have a significant element of deterrence. There is no other way at the moment that the court can reflect the need to ensure the streets of this country are as safe as possible."" Those words apply equally to this case where the aggravating features are more serious. As to the harm caused, as the Lord Chief Justice observed, it is at the highest level. Culpability in this case is also high. In R v AM, Kika and Saddique [2009] EWCA Crim 2544 , Lord Judge CJ observed (at para. 9) that: "" anyone who goes into a public place armed with a knife or any other weapon and uses it to kill or to cause injury, and who is brought to justice, must anticipate condign punishment."" The deceased was attacked with knives, brought to the scene by a large group of teenagers who, at one stage, entered a conspiracy to cause really serious bodily injury even if, in the event, the jury were not sure (in the case of those convicted of manslaughter) that they intended or foresaw such harm actually being inflicted. Counsel have referred to a number of decisions in support of submissions that the sentences imposed for the homicide offences were manifestly excessive although, in our judgment, a historical analysis  even before the change in the law  does not support such a proposition. In R v Carter [2008] EWCA Crim 707 , a sentence of 10 years was upheld for manslaughter when a knife was used in a fight, the court rejecting (at para. 26) the proposition that there was a necessary distinction between cases where the verdict of manslaughter is based on provocation, unreasonable force going beyond self-defence or lack of intent to cause serious bodily harm. Reference was then made to the observations in R v Latham [1997] 2 Cr App R (S) 10, which concerned provocation manslaughter and three counts of wounding with intent (following a fight in a night club during which the offender produced and used a knife), when Kennedy LJ said: ""Even when a particular type of manslaughter is isolated from the rest it has to be recognised that it covers a wide field and if justice is to be done sentencers must not be put in straitjackets, but ... it seems to us that where an offender deliberately goes out with a knife, carrying it as a weapon, and uses it to cause death, even if there is provocation, he should expect to receive on conviction in a contested case a sentence in the region of 10-12 years."" R v Bishop [2011] EWCA 1225 is another case where this court declined to interfere with a 12 year sentence for manslaughter based on lack of intent imposed on a 26 year old of good character who stabbed the former partner (and father of the child) of his then partner following ongoing domestic difficulties. The circumstances were very different and although the court made reference to the need for appropriate sentences in knife crime, the offence was committed well before the change brought about by para. 5A of Schedule 21. The high water mark of the submissions is to be found in R v Yemoh & ors [2009] EWCA Crim 1775 . Although, again, obviously before the change of law (the offence having been committed in March 2007), it has certain factual similarities to this case. Two boys of 13 and 15 were convicted of the murder of a 16 year old boy; three other boys who were 13, 14 and 16 at the time of the killing, were convicted of manslaughter. The victim had been lured into a residential street for a one-on-one fight when he was set upon, threatened with a Stanley knife and stabbed with a knife or sharp implement. The judge spoke of a ""gang culture which casts its dreadful influence over so much of the youth of our inner cities"". He sentenced those convicted of murder (one of whom was of prior good character) to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure with minimum terms of 15 years. The three convicted of manslaughter (the 14 and 16 year olds with previous convictions including robbery or attempted robbery), received extended sentences 15 years with custodial terms of 10 years and extended licence of 5 years. This court concluded that the finding of premeditation of the type to which Schedule 21 refers was not made out but noted the aggravating features of the prolonged chase and attack, the possession of two knives and other weapons and the fact that ""these events took place in broad daylight in a residential street, to the horror of people going about their business"". A further aggravating feature for the 13 year old convicted of murder and two of those convicted of manslaughter had been involved in an earlier incident a month before involving a different youth. The mitigation included the extreme youth of the offenders and the fact that the intention was to cause serious harm only (rather than to kill). In the event, because of the different finding in relation to premeditation and giving due weight to the ages of the offenders, from the starting point of 12 years, increased to 15 years, the minimum term of those convicted of murder was reduced to 13 years. The sentences on the two convicted of manslaughter (involved in the previous incident) were reduced to extended terms of 13 years (of which 9 years was the custodial term and 4 years the extended licence) and the 13 year old of prior good character not involved in the earlier incident had his sentence reduced to an extended term of 11 years (being a custodial term of 8 years and an extended licence of 3 years). For our part, although we understand the parallels to which reference has been made, we do not consider that this decision governs (or necessarily impacts upon) this case and we were not surprised that Mr David Spens Q.C. (who had been one of those who had referred to this decision in the appeal documentation) disavowed reliance on it. The differences are obvious. This court specifically rejected the aggravating feature of premeditation and the offenders were very much younger: the younger the offender, necessarily, the greater the potential for a reduced assessment of culpability. Further, this decision did not take account of parliamentary intention to increase the sentences on those who participate in taking weapons to a scene and using them to kill. In relation to the offence of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm, the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council deals with non-fatal offences of violence and applies to all offenders aged 18 or over sentenced on or after 13 June 2011 (i.e. to each of these offenders save for Richards). It does not specifically deal with inchoate offences, but it is obviously relevant to examine the approach to sentencing the complete offence when dealing with attempts and conspiracy to commit that offence. The guideline is sufficiently flexible and capable of adjustment to reflect the differing circumstances and ensure consistency of approach. For those who were not convicted of murder or manslaughter, it is of critical importance to approach the issue of sentence without incorporating the fact of death into a conspiracy which carries with it an intention to cause really serious injury. For those who did not inflict the stabbing injury, the jury were directed to convict of manslaughter if sure that they were party to a joint enterprise to cause unlawful violence, knew that at least one of the attackers had a knife or other bladed instrument and knew that the attacker might use it to stab the victim intending to cause some injury or harm, but falling short of killing or causing really serious harm. Thus, the only proper interpretation of the verdicts of the jury in relation to those acquitted of murder and manslaughter but convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm is that the jury was sure of participation in an agreement to inflict grievous bodily harm on the opposing group in Victoria Station, they were not sure either that at least one of the attackers had a knife or other bladed instrument or, alternatively, did not realise that an attacker with a knife would or might use it to stab with intent to cause any injury. It goes without saying that for these offenders, the fatal injuries cannot be taken into account and the case must be considered on the basis of intended injury only; aggravating features could involve use of some sort of weapon (such as a shod foot) but not a knife. The useful parallel, therefore (which could be no more than that) could be with category 2; the starting point would be 6 years custody and the category range of 5 to 9 years. Aggravating and mitigating factors would then fall to be considered in the usual way. The Individual Appeals and Applications Christopher Omeregi and Obi Nwokeh We deal first with those convicted of murder. Mr George Payne for Omoregie and Mr Jerome Lynch Q.C. for Nwokeh argue that the learned judge erred in concluding that there was an intention to kill, as opposed to an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. They argued that this interpretation of events did not accord with the verdicts of the jury. Of the 8 youths in the ticket hall, said to be acting as one group, only 2 were convicted of murder and the others of manslaughter. It must be concluded therefore, that the jury did not conclude that there was a group intention to kill. It was the case for the prosecution that Omoregie and Nwokeh had themselves attacked the deceased with knives and it was contended that, having regard to the acts recorded on CCTV along with the nature and location of the injuries described by the pathologist, the intention could only have been to kill. The judge was of the same view and expressed described the attack as ""ferocious and merciless"", a view we share having seen for ourselves the CCTV images. He conducted the trial and was in the best position to make his assessment, consistent with the verdicts of the jury, of the intentions of each offender and he was entitled to do so. We have dealt with the further argument raised by Mr Jerome Lynch Q.C. on behalf of Nwokeh relating to Yemoh above. Although we recognise that for these young men, the sentences imposed may appear to them to be overwhelming in length, the need to punish and deter others made them inevitable. From a starting point of 12 years, these offences were seriously aggravated not only by the planning and premeditation for mass violence in public at the height of the rush hour but also the participation as one of a large group involved in attacking the deceased with weapons brought for the purpose and so effectively used. Youth was encompassed by the reduced starting point (which would otherwise have been 25 years) and the mitigation and positive aspects of these applicants' characters were recognised. The sentences were neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive: these applications are refused. Samson Odegbune The appeal of Odegbune in relation to his sentence for murder raises slightly different issues. First, Mr Robert Marshall Andrews Q.C. argues that the only feature aggravating the offence above the starting point of 12 years was the degree of pre-planning but that this had to be seen in the light of the serious, acknowledged and accepted threats by the aggressive group described as GFL (including the suggestion of a gun possibly being available) whereas there is no reference to these crucial elements in the sentencing remarks. It is, however, clear that, following the verdicts of the jury, the judge rejected any element of self defence but concluded that this was a planned confrontation. In any event, this was not the only feature aggravating the offence: as we have analysed the principles involved, the use of weapons brought to the scene very seriously aggravates the offence above the starting point prescribed in the legislation. He also submits that in asserting that Odegbune, along with the others convicted of murder, showed no remorse, the judge ignored the statement to that effect in the pre-sentence report: the judge had, of course, been able to observe this appellant throughout the very lengthy trial: he was not bound by the view of the probation officer after conviction. As for his academic success and progress, he said in terms that he had taken account of all that had been advanced on behalf of the appellant ""and the positive aspects of your conduct while in custody"". In our judgment, Mr Marshall Andrews' strongest point concerned the basis upon which Odegbune was sentenced, namely, the intention to kill attributed to the primary participants to the violent stabbing. Whatever steps he had taken to organise and orchestrate the violent confrontation, it is argued that he had taken no actual part in any violence aimed at the deceased but had led a different contingent (albeit brandishing a samurai sword and shouting, as the judge found, ""We're going to fuck you up""), inflicting no injury at all. The jury clearly (and, by dismissing the application for leave to appeal against conviction, we have concluded safely) found that his role as the leader of the conspiracy also encompassed his intention or foresight that one or more of the conspirators would use a knife or knives to kill or cause really serious injury. Although it created no inconsistency of verdict, however, we accept that there was not the same material in his case (compared to the cases of those who engaged directly in the attack) to justify concluding that he had an intention to kill. We agree with Mr Marshall Andrews that it is appropriate to read the sentencing remarks in that way. Having said that, however, had the judge concluded that the extent of Odegnune's responsibility for the entire incident through the leadership which he had shown in its organisation and in leading the charge meant that, even though he had not been part of the murderous attack, his responsibility was the same as those killing with intention to kill, the court might well have taken the view that the conclusion was not one with which it ought to interfere. He did not, however, say that. On the basis that he could not attribute to Odegbune an intention to kill, recognising that the conviction for murder was clearly a consequence of his leadership role, it is important that there is no double counting. In the circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that the judge should have differentiated slightly between those who carried knives to the scene and, with the intention to kill, no doubt formed in the heat of the moment, caused death; and that of Odegbune who might have played a far greater role in the organisation of the confrontation but in respect of whom it cannot be said that he intended death, however great the risk of that outcome. In the circumstances, the minimum term in his case is reduced by 2 years to 16 years. Adonis Junior Akra Turning to those convicted of manslaughter, on behalf of Akra, Mr David Spens Q.C. submits that the starting point for the murderers was too high and thus those convicted of manslaughter should similarly have their sentences reviewed. We have considered the principles in the analysis above and have no doubt that, as the law presently stands, it was not. Similarly, the general approach to the manslaughter sentences (bearing in mind the harm and the impact of the approach to homicide) cannot be faulted. He also submitted that the judge had failed to reflect the different roles played by each of those convicted of manslaughter, suggesting that Akra's role was no more serious than that of Oderinwale or Roberts but clearly less serious than that of Osoteku, an 18 year old girl who had played a key role in arming the murderers and delivered the final kick to the deceased. Responding to the Grounds of Appeal, the single judge put it this way: ""This was a group conspiracy and a group action. Although there were differences in the precise role and involvement of different defendants the Judge was entitled to take view that a consistent approach should be adopted with the same sentences being imposed for similar offending. Further, any differences which could be argued for in relation to the applicant would not render his sentence manifestly excessive either in itself or when compared to that of others. The applicant was one of the group of killers, was armed and struck the victim. ... Further, given the public nature of the offending, a fatal, mass charge and attack with the brandishing and use of knives taking place at Victoria station during rush hour, the Judge would have been justified in including a deterrent element in his sentencing."" We agree with these remarks. The need for a deterrent sentence is undeniable and, even making every allowance for the antecedents, background and references which this applicant has amassed (and paying tribute to the very positive aspects of his character which we have no doubt will serve him well in the future), in the light of all the circumstances, it is impossible to say that the sentence imposed was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive. This application is refused. Femi Oderinwale Mr Corsellis for Oderinwale argues that the sentences imposed for murder were arguably manifestly excessive so that the sentences for manslaughter ought to be adjusted: we have rejected the premise and this argument falls. He also submits that the starting point for manslaughter was too high and failed to reflect the role Oderinwale played. In addition to the authorities set out above, he also cites R v Bishop [2011] EWCA Crim 1225 but that decision is not, as he submits, authority approving Carter . Carter was cited but the decision of the court (per Davis J as he then was) was simply that the sentence imposed in the case under appeal (12 years) could not be challenged. In any event, that killing took place before the change in the law. It is also argued that the judge failed to take account of the genuine fear of attack (dealt with above) or the fact that a plea to manslaughter had been offered. This last is no mitigation unless the plea is openly tendered in court and before the jury, which this was not. To suggest that such would be unrealistic where the defence being run was lack of knowledge of weapons, lack of specific intent to injure and chasing his perceived attackers away is to underline that no admission was, in fact, being made to the crime of manslaughter. The delay following conviction (before the judge could deal with all the offenders in one sentencing hearing) was a regrettable consequence of the nature of the crime: it does not justify a reduction in sentence. Finally, Mr Corsellis recognised that the 8 year sentence for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm was fully merited, but that the fact that his role came to an end before the events at Victoria Station should have led to a lesser sentence for manslaughter. We do not agree. The sentence for conspiracy did not reflect the fact that the knives he acquired were used in the subsequent attack and that fatal injury resulted. In his case, that fact was a necessary ingredient to be recognised in the ultimate sentence for manslaughter. Once again, we agree with the remarks of the single judge when he refused this application, expressed in these terms: ""The applicant played a key role in the conspiracy and helped initiate it. He took a principal part in the communications the previous evening which involved getting ""tooled up"" and contemplated their adversaries getting ""slumped"" (killed). He then acted as armourer for the group. He was responsible for the purchase of kitchen knives from Argos, some of which were used to kill the victim. Although there was a responsive element to the conspiracy the Judge found that the group travelled to Victoria expecting and intending trouble and prepared and armed for it. Even if the jury's manslaughter verdict indicates a subsequent intent to cause lesser injury, death was a foreseeable and actual consequence of the conspiracy of which the applicant was convicted. The applicant was part of the mass charge across Terminus Place although he did not join in the attack on the victim. He was pursuing others. He was convicted on the basis that he intentionally purchased or assisted in the purchase of knives, or distributed or assisted in the distribution of those knives, realising that some harm might result."" Samuel Junior Roberts On behalf of Roberts, Mr Benn Maguire also submits that the judge failed to distinguish between the parts played by those convicted of manslaughter. Roberts had played no part in the planning, joined the conspiracy on the spur of the moment and did not have a weapon. On the other hand, Roberts was convicted on the basis that he knew that at least one of the group was armed with a knife or other bladed weapon and foresaw it might be used to cause some harm. Second, although not using a knife (which would doubtless have led to a conviction for murder), he utilised another weapon, namely his shod foot. In that regard, it is worth repeating the observations of the learned judge. He said: ""No one who has seen the CCTV images of the scene could fail to be horrified by the ferocity of one of the kicks you delivered to the head of the deceased - it was if you were kicking a rugby football. Your action were vicious and victim, defenceless."" The single judge repeated the observations about group conspiracy and group action that he had made in relation to the application by Akra, observing that Roberts was one of a group of killers who viciously and repeatedly kicked the victim. The trial judge specifically said that he had reflected his youth, his antecedents and his behaviour in custody. In our judgment, this deterrent sentence is not arguably wrong in principle or manifestly excessive and this application is refused. Tyrone Richards and Enoch Charles Amoah These cases can be considered together. In both cases, each appellant was acquitted of any involvement in the homicide but convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. The distinguishing feature in their cases was that each had joined the conspiracy hatched by others only at Victoria Station; they then joined in the mass, armed charge across Terminus Place which placed so many members of the public in fear but they were neither armed nor part of the attack on the victim (although Richards had some article in his hand the nature of which the judge expressed himself as unable to determine). The first ground of appeal is that the judge passed the same sentence for conspiracy on these appellants as he had on most of those convicted of homicide offences. This ignores the fact that these were all concurrent terms to longer sentences, but the point is fairly made that the judge failed to distinguish between their parts and that played by the other offenders. For Richards, Mr Garry Green argues that, given the offences of which he had been convicted, more attention could be paid to the fact that he was the youngest of the group, whose involvement was expressed to assist his uncle (Odegbune); he was of good character and positive antecedents. Furthermore, he remained under 18 and sentencing principles required consideration for his welfare and the aim of reducing offending. For Amoah, Mr Charles Sherrard Q.C. submits that this was more of a notional conspiracy than involvement by physically playing a role which assisted others: it was critical to have regard to precisely what he did which was to join in as he got off the bus, run the 200-300 yards and then leave (without going down the steps into the station). Mr Sherrard referred to R v Thomas & others [2010] EWCA Crim 148 in which extended sentences of 8 years (comprising custodial terms of 4 years with extended licences of 4 years) were passed on two offenders in circumstances which he contended were more serious than these. We derive no assistance from the case which is no more than an example of a sentence passed at first instance: those offenders did not appeal this sentence for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm but only the concurrent identical (and unlawful) term for violent disorder. It has no authoritative value whatsoever and, in any event, was prior to the issue of guidance by the Sentencing Council intended to reflect an increase in sentences for the most serious non-fatal offences of violence, namely causing grievous bodily harm with intent and wounding with intent consequent upon the increased seriousness that Parliament had accorded to murder and, thus, homicide generally (as demonstrated by the cases to which we have referred). Using the guideline analogously, however, we see force in the submission that for this offence of conspiracy, by these appellants, with the more limited involvement identified by the judge, a different approach was justified from that adopted for those convicted of homicide, especially in the case of Richards. In our judgment, the sentences imposed did not adequately reflect this very different position which, bearing in mind their youth, good character and positive reports did not need to be as long as 7 years. Although we can see an argument for distinguishing between the two because of their different ages, in the end, we have felt it appropriate to defer to the view of the trial judge (who, we repeat, had the opportunity of assessing each offender over the weeks of the trial) and have decided not to do so. Although the limited role that Amoah and Richards played must be reflected in the sentence imposed, any participation in public violence of this nature, involving an intention to cause really serious harm, must inevitably be treated very seriously. In the circumstances, we quash the sentences of 7 years respectively of detention and in a young offender institution and impose sentences of 5½ years in their place. Conclusion The judge had a very difficult sentencing exercise to perform and nothing we have said should be taken as critical of the attention to which he paid to it; we also pay tribute to the careful analysis provided by the single judge. Standing back and reviewing the approach against the backdrop of the entire case and in the light of the arguments now advanced, we have come to the conclusion that the appeal of Odegbune should be allowed: the sentence of detention at Her Majesty's pleasure remains but the minimum term which he must serve is reduced from 18 years to 16 years simply on the basis that, although his leading role must be underlined (and doubtless led to his conviction for murder), the finding of a specific intention to kill in his case cannot be sustained. It is important to repeat that the passage of this period will not necessarily mean his release: he will only be released when the parole board consider that he does not represent a risk to the public and it is safe to do so. The appeals of Richards and Amoah will similarly be allowed: the periods of 7 years detention under s. 91 of the 2000 Act (in relation to Richards) and in a young offender institution (in relation to Amoah) are quashed and periods of 5½ years detention substituted. No other adjustment to the sentences is appropriate; the remaining renewed applications for leave to appeal against sentence are refused. We cannot leave this case without commenting on the devastation that this terrible incident has caused to so many lives. At the top of the list, by far, is the fact that a 15 year old schoolboy, Sofyen Belamouadden, lost his life and all that it held for him. We have read the impact statements that his parents have provided and we have no doubt that they, their remaining children and their wider family and friends have suffered enormously from the devastation of his death: this loss will scar the family's lives forever. Albeit entirely self inflicted, it is also worth pointing out that a dozen or so young people of prior good character with academic achievement and promise have also blighted their own lives and impacted on the lives of those who have been supportive of them. The account of this case should be told and repeated to young people everywhere: knives kill people and the effect of the madness of a few hours  or of a moment  will ripple out and destroy or devastate many lives. That is why the courts will and must always place punishment and deterrence at the forefront of any sentencing decision is cases such as these."

Neutral Citation Number: [2024] EWCA Crim 59 CASE NO 20230220/A3 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL CRIMINAL DIVISION Royal Courts of Justice Strand London WC2A 2LL 17 January 2024 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE COULSON MRS JUSTICE FOSTER MR JUSTICE HILLIARD ____________________ REX v ERIK FELD ____________________ Computer Aided Transcript of Epiq Europe Ltd, Lower Ground Floor, 46 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1JE Tel No: 020 7404 1400; Email: rcj@epiqglobal.co.uk (Official Shorthand Writers to the Court) ____________________ MR A MORRIS appeared on behalf of the Applicant. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © LORD JUSTICE COULSON: Introduction The applicant is now 38. On 23 March 2023, he was convicted of murder at the Central Criminal Court. On 14 June 2023, he was sentenced by Bryan J (""the sentencing judge"") to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 28 years, less the period of 506 days spent on remand. He renews his application for permission to appeal against that sentence following refusal by the single judge. The Relevant Facts In the early hours of 16 August 2021, the applicant went to Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park. He went there armed with a claw hammer and the clear intention of killing any man he encountered. He knew that it was a large park, which was unlit at night, with extensive areas of trees and dense undergrowth. He also knew that there would be lone men in the park even in the middle of the night. The planning involved the applicant collecting hammers with a view to using them to assault and kill. Although, following his arrest, he refused to provide the PIN number for his mobile phone, that phone was accessed by the police. The phone showed Google searches for amongst other things ""murder footage"" and ""murder videos"". The applicant had visited web pages with the associated thumbnails and videos containing real-life footage of people being murdered. The majority showed them being hammered to death. There were also photographs of the applicant himself brandishing a claw hammer on his phone. The applicant came across Ranjith Kankanamalage in the park. He attacked him with the hammer in a sustained and unprovoked attack. He struck Mr Kankanamalage at least 12 times; at least three of those blows required severe force. The victim's skull was shattered, and the brain penetrated. Sadly, the victim had defensive injuries to his hands and arm, so it was clear that he had not been killed by the first or second blow. His suffering and terror must have been extensive. It was, on any view, a savage and pitiless murder. The applicant was arrested on 20 August 2021, for unrelated offences of affray and possession of a (different) claw hammer which he had brandished at a store security guard. His flat was searched, and two sledgehammers and two mallets were discovered and confiscated. Subsequently his DNA was recovered from Mr Kankanamalage's fingernails. The applicant was re-arrested on 21 January 2022 on suspicion of murder, and a further hammer and a cut-throat razer was found by his bed. The applicant denied murder. He said that he had taken a hammer to the park to strike trees to alleviate his tension. He also maintained that he had acted in lawful self-defence. At no point in the preparation for, or during the trial did the applicant accept that he had killed Mr Kankanamalage but that, due to a pre-existing mental condition, he was only guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. He was duly convicted of murder. The sentencing judge described his purported defence as ""a cock-and-bull story"". The Sentencing Exercise The sentencing judge provided detailed sentencing remarks which, in their written form, ran to 52 paragraphs. They are careful and considered. Since a life sentence was mandatory, the sentencing remarks explain the assessment of the appropriate minimum term which, as we have said, the sentencing judge fixed at 28 years, less time spent on remand. It was agreed that having taken the hammer to the park with an intent to kill or cause serious injury, the starting point for the minimum term, in the applicant's case, was one of 25 years (see paragraph 41 of the sentencing remarks). The judge then found a series of aggravating features beginning at paragraph 42. These included: (a) the very significant degree of planning and premeditation; (b) the extreme violence used in the killing, (including evidence that at least some of the wounds were consistent with being caused by the round head of the hammer whilst others were consistent with being caused by the claw end); (c) the fact that this was an attack on a stranger, in a public park at night and that in consequence Mr Kankanamalage was a vulnerable victim; (d) the applicant's previous convictions for a range of offences, including one incident in June 2011 involving sexual assault, battery, possession of an offensive weapon and criminal damage. On that occasion, amongst other things, the applicant brandished an axe at passengers on the District Line, pushing it in their faces and threatening them. We also note that, in another incident to which the sentencing judge referred (which happened the day after the murder, outside a shop in East London), the applicant produced a claw hammer and lifted it, threateningly, above his head whilst shouting at the security guard inside. Importantly, on that occasion, the applicant exercised sufficient self-control to walk away. That is something to which we will return later in this judgment. The judge found that the only mitigation was the personality disorder from which the applicant suffered, as explained in detail in a psychiatric report, produced by Dr Stephen Attard and dated 24 May 2024. The judge's sentencing remarks dealt with that report at paragraphs 27 to 38. In that context, the judge also had regard to the Sentencing Guideline in respect of Sentencing Offenders with Mental Disorders, which we shall call ""the relevant Guideline"". The crux of the judge's conclusions was as follows: ""34. In this regard the Guideline helpfully identifies a useful starting point to be to ask the questions identified in the Guideline. I have had regard to all such questions, however I consider the following to be of particular relevance:- 'At the time of the offence did the offender's impairment or disorder impair their ability: to exercise appropriate judgement to make rational choices to understand the nature and consequences of their actions?"". 35. I am greatly helped in this regard by the conclusions of Dr Attard at paragraph 243 of his report where he concludes: '243. In considering the above, it is likely that Mr Feld was experiencing a period of instability at the time of the index offence as a result of increased psychosocial stressors. The manifestations of his personality disorder were likely significant in regard his behaviour at the material time including his ability to exercise appropriate judgement, make choices and consider the nature and consequence of his actions, albeit not to a degree that substantially impaired his ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgement or exercise self control.' ( emphasis added) ."" 36. In such circumstances, and having heard all the evidence in the trial, and bearing in mind all that I know about you, whilst there was a reduction in culpability such reduction was only limited and certainly not significant not least given that the matters identified were not to a degree that substantially impaired your ability to understand the nature of your conduct or to form a rationale judgment or to exercise self-control. 37. I reject the submission that your disorder significantly reduced your culpability, and reject the submission that although your condition did not give rise to a defence of diminished responsibility the circumstances fell not far short of that. 38. In this regard I am satisfied that you understood perfectly well the nature of your conduct and that it was wrong to equip yourself with a hammer and to go out with the intention of killing a random stranger, that you retained the ability to form a rationale judgment as to just how wrong such conduct was, and I am satisfied that your ability to exercise self control was not substantially impaired. Rather, in such circumstances, you formed a deliberate intent to go out and carry into effect your long held fantasy to kill a random stranger for your own gratification."" We should also refer to two other paragraphs in the sentencing remarks because they go directly to some of the submissions made this morning by Mr Morris. They are paragraphs 45 and 46: ""45. The only real mitigation, such as it is, is your personality disorder. In this regard Schedule 21 paragraph 10(c) of the Sentencing Act 2020 identifies, as possible mitigation, 'the fact that the offender suffered from any mental disorder or mental disability' which '(although not falling within section 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957) lowered the offender's degree of culpability'. I have already addressed your personality disorder in detail above. As there identified I consider that whilst there was a reduction in culpability such reduction was only limited and certainly not significant not least given that the matters identified were not to a degree that substantially impaired your ability to understand the nature of your conduct or to form a rationale judgment or to exercise self-control."" Paragraph 46 then repeated paragraph 38, noted above. For these reasons the sentencing judge concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the one mitigating factor represented by the applicant's personality disorder. As he put it at paragraph 48 of the sentencing remarks: "" I have made an appropriate downwards adjustment from the substantially raised starting point to take account of your mitigation such as it is."" That resulted in an overall uplift from the original starting point of 25 years to one of 28 years, with an appropriate reduction for time spent on remand. The Grounds of Appeal There are three grounds of appeal. First, it is said that the judge failed properly to apply the statutory mitigating feature set out in paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020 (an offender suffering from a mental disorder). It is said that the judge confused that test with the potential defence of diminished responsibility and therefore underplayed the significance of the applicant's personality disorder in the sentencing exercise. Secondly, it is alleged the judge failed to follow the conclusions of Dr Attard to the effect that the mental disorder was a significant contributing factor to his culpability. Thirdly, it is said that the judge's treatment of the aggravating factors not only failed to reflect the applicant's mental disorder, but gave rise to an inflated starting point before any reduction for that disorder, which meant that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The Single Judge The single judge rejected those points when refusing permission to appeal. As to the first, he considered that the complaint was ""essentially semantic"": whilst the judge did, on occasion, use the language applicable for a defence of diminished responsibility, hence the reference to ""substantially impaired"", that reflected the language of the relevant Guideline that he was applying. He found that the sentencing judge had regard to the right test at paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21 because, amongst other things, he found that there was ""a reduction in culpability"". As to the wider question of Dr Attard's report, the single judge rejected the suggestion that the sentencing judge had somehow ignored Dr Attard's evidence. On the contrary, he said that the sentencing judge, although not bound by it, had in fact relied on the report in a number of important respects. He also said that the sentencing judge, having presided over the trial, had the benefit of considering all the evidence, not just the report of Dr Attard. The evidence as a whole was reflected in the sentencing remarks. As to the final point, concerned with the aggravating factors, the single judge noted that the applicant had other convictions for violence with weapons and that there were other significant aggravating factors. For these reasons, he concluded that the minimum term of 28 years was not excessive. The Renewed Application Hearing In the course of his clear submissions this morning, Mr Morris sought to renew the application for permission to appeal. Although he essentially restated the three points that we have already noted, we are happy to acknowledge both the clarity and thoughtfulness with which those submissions were advanced. We acknowledge that it is not easy for counsel in Mr Morris's position to seek to persuade a court that a minimum term imposed as a result of an horrific murder should somehow be reduced. Mr Morris's submissions properly recognised those difficulties but remained focused on the particular points he wanted to raise. We have given those three points considerable thought, and we shall explain our views on them in a moment. But we have concluded that the single judge was right to refuse permission to appeal. Our reasons are as follows. Ground 1: The Alleged Misapplication of Paragraph 10(C) Paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020 provides that mitigating factors that may be relevant to the offence of murder include the fact that the offender suffered from any mental disorder or mental disability which, although not falling within section 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957, lowered the offender's degree of culpability. The reference to section 2(1) is of course a reference to the defence of diminished responsibility. Whilst the relevant Guideline is too long to summarise properly in this judgment, we note that: (a) Paragraph 4 warns that mental disorders can fluctuate; (b) Paragraph 9 states that culpability may be reduced if an offender was, at the time of the offence, suffering from an impairment or disorder; (c) Paragraph 11 states that culpability will only be reduced if there is sufficient connection between the offender's impairment or disorder and the offending behaviour; (d) Paragraph 12 makes the obvious point that, in some cases, the impairment or disorder may mean that culpability is significantly reduced whilst in other cases the impairment or disorder may have no relevance to culpability at all; (e) Amongst the suggested questions in paragraph 15, the relevant Guideline asks whether, at the time of the offence, the disorder impaired the offender's ability to exercise appropriate judgment; to make rational choices; and to understand the nature and consequences of their actions. That last question was, of course, the question which the sentencing judge expressly asked himself in the passage from his sentencing remarks which we have already set out. Mr Morris's complaint under Ground 1 is that the judge confused the general test set out in paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21, with the test for the sort of reduction in culpability required to make good a defence of diminished responsibility. In short, it was said that the bar was set too high. Putting it another way, as Mr Morris does at paragraph 30 of his grounds, he said that, whilst the evidence was that the applicant's ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control were not substantially impaired, his personality disorder was a significant contributing factor to his conduct and amounted to a significant mitigating factor. We understand why the single judge described this as a ""semantic"" argument. However, we acknowledge that there are passages in the judgment which might have given the impression that the judge was running the two tests together. But the position in principle, which we consider the judge properly followed, is straightforward. If an offender suffers from a mental disorder then, in accordance with paragraph 10(c), that may lower his or her degree of culpability, and in that way, it may amount to a mitigating factor. That is so even in circumstances where the disorder could not justify a submission, let alone a finding, of diminished responsibility. But the reason why it is a mitigating factor is because, as the relevant Guideline explains, it may reduce, even significantly reduce, the offender's culpability: the extent to which the offender is to blame for the crime. In this case, in accordance with paragraph 10(c) and the relevant Guideline, the sentencing judge found that the applicant did suffer from a personality disorder and that that did reduce his degree of culpability. So the only remaining issue was the question of degree or extent of the reduction. That was quintessentially a matter for the sentencing judge who, in this case, had also presided over the trial. So despite the language of some parts of the sentencing remarks, we are bound to reject the suggestion that the judge somehow became confused between the test identified in paragraph 10(c) and the test for diminished responsibility. In our judgment, he was always focused on the right test, namely whether there was a reduction in culpability at the time of the offence because of the personality disorder. That inevitably had an overlap with the test for diminished responsibility; indeed we note that that overlap was prayed in aid on behalf of the applicant, because in the sentencing note prepared by Mr Morris, he argued to the judge that although the ""applicant's condition did not give rise to a defence of diminished responsibility, it is open to the court to conclude that it did not fall too far short of that"". That submission was carefully considered by the judge and, in the passage that we have already identified, was rejected. Accordingly, in our view, the judge had in mind the right test under paragraph 10(c) and so, for the reasons that we have given, we reject Ground 1 of the appeal. Ground 2 - Dr Attard's Report Accordingly, this was a case where there was an accepted personality disorder, and the only question was the degree to which that reduced the applicant's culpability. Although, as we have said, that was quintessentially a matter for the sentencing judge (as the relevant Guideline explains at paragraph 13), Dr Attard's report was of assistance in arriving at an answer to that question. As we have said, Dr Attard was clear at paragraph 243 of his report that, at the time of the murder, the applicant's personality disorder did not substantially impair his ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control. In other words, his personality disorder did not/could not significantly reduce the applicant's culpability and therefore could not be a significant mitigating factor. On a proper analysis therefore, we consider that the judge was correct to approach the matter in the way that he did. We do not accept the suggestion that the judge did not have proper regard to Dr Attard's report. We consider that he had careful regard to what Dr Attard had said. We have already referred to paragraph 243, but there are other passages to which we would refer. We note, for example, that Dr Attard said that there was ""no evidence"" to suggest that the applicant was acutely psychotic at the time of the alleged offence (see paragraph 240 of the report). We note that, on the contrary, Dr Attard noted that the contemporaneous medical records showed that he was ""relatively stable"" in the months prior to the murder (see paragraph 237). We are also bound to note that at paragraphs 129 and 131 of the report, Dr Attard noted that various contemporaneous medical records, compiled following interviews and examinations shortly after the murder, recorded that there was ""no psychotic symptoms"" and that the applicant ""seemed calm... lucid and clear... He seemed to be himself."" We should also refer to the fact that, both in Dr Attard's report and in the evidence, there were a number of examples of incidents where the applicant had become consumed with ideas of rage and potential murder, but in which he had exercised self-control to walk away from those situations. The judge referred to that material in passing. He did not set it out in his sentencing remarks. It seems to us that that was a potentially important element of the background evidence and another reason why the judge was right to conclude, as Dr Attard had concluded, that the ability to exercise self-control was not substantially impaired and therefore was not a significant mitigating factor. It is also important to note, as we have recorded the single judge as saying, that Dr Attard's report was only one part of the material which the judge had to take into account when sentencing the applicant. The sentencing judge had presided over the trial and was therefore perfectly placed to reach a fully considered conclusion as to the degree of culpability of the applicant and the appropriate sentence. That is what paragraph 13 of the relevant Guideline stresses that the judge should do. Dr Attard's report was one, albeit very important, element of the material that was relevant to the sentencing exercise. For all those reasons therefore, we do not consider that Ground 2 is arguable. Ground 3 - The Aggravating Factors Finally, there is Mr Morris's submission about the aggravating factors which the sentencing judge took into account. It is said that the aggravating factors were symptoms of the applicant's mental disorder, so that the judge's treatment of them as aggravating factors was both erroneous and confusing. It is also separately said that the judge placed too much weight on them anyway, particularly the significant planning and premeditation. In our view, those criticisms are misplaced. As to the planning, the judge found that the applicant had carefully planned the murder and that included viewing the videos, before going out at night, to a location where he knew that potential victims would be present, having equipped himself with a hammer and concealed it in a bag. All of that was to give effect to the applicant's intention to murder a random stranger. That was a degree of planning which amounted to a significant aggravating factor. This was not the sort of murder that happened off the cuff, or randomly, or as a result of a spur of the moment incident. On this particular point, moreover, the sentencing judge expressly addressed the issue of whether the applicant's personality disorder negated or reduced the impact of the aggravating factor, and he explained why it did not: see paragraphs 38 and 46 of the sentencing remarks. Therefore, we are bound to agree with the sentencing judge, that the planning and premeditation were not explained by the personality disorder. The applicant, according to Dr Attard, was able to understand the nature of what he was preparing to do and yet failed to exercise any self-control. All of that goes to the first of the aggravating factors, namely the planning and premeditation, but the other aggravating factors, in our view, were not explained by the personality disorder in any event. Those included the extreme violence used in the killing, the vulnerability of the victim and the previous convictions. Accordingly, we conclude that the sentencing judge was entitled to find that the aggravating factors outweighed the single mitigating factor. Therefore, although the learned judge did not set out the detail of the calculation, having concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the single mitigating factor, he uplifted the starting point from 25 years to a minimum term of 28 years. We do not consider that that uplift was wrong in principle or erroneous in law. Accordingly, we reject the submission that the 28-year minimum term was manifestly excessive. We repeat our gratitude to Mr Morris for his careful submissions this morning, but this renewed application for permission to appeal must be refused. MR MORRIS: Could I ask for a representation order in this case? (The Bench Conferred) LORD JUSTICE COULSON: Mr Morris, I think the position is that, although we would, personally, grant you that order, we do not think we can because we have not granted you leave. MR MORRIS: I know in other renewed cases I have tried to get the Registrar to grant it in advance of the hearing, so I think I know the Registrar has powers. LORD JUSTICE COULSON: Let us leave it like this. If you communicate with the Registrar, now, you can say that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the Court would grant you a representation order, if it had the power. The Court freely accepts it does not know if it has the power; the Registrar will know. If we do have the power, you can have a representation order; if we do not, you cannot. Can we be any clearer? MR MORRIS: No, you cannot.

On 23 March 2023, he was convicted of murder at the Central Criminal Court. On 14 June 2023, he was sentenced by Bryan J (""the sentencing judge"") to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 28 years, less the period of 506 days spent on remand. He renews his application for permission to appeal against that sentence following refusal by the single judge. The Relevant Facts In the early hours of 16 August 2021, the applicant went to Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park. He went there armed with a claw hammer and the clear intention of killing any man he encountered. He knew that it was a large park, which was unlit at night, with extensive areas of trees and dense undergrowth. He also knew that there would be lone men in the park even in the middle of the night. The planning involved the applicant collecting hammers with a view to using them to assault and kill. Although, following his arrest, he refused to provide the PIN number for his mobile phone, that phone was accessed by the police. The phone showed Google searches for amongst other things ""murder footage"" and ""murder videos"". The applicant had visited web pages with the associated thumbnails and videos containing real-life footage of people being murdered. The majority showed them being hammered to death. There were also photographs of the applicant himself brandishing a claw hammer on his phone. The applicant came across Ranjith Kankanamalage in the park. He attacked him with the hammer in a sustained and unprovoked attack. He struck Mr Kankanamalage at least 12 times; at least three of those blows required severe force. The victim's skull was shattered, and the brain penetrated. Sadly, the victim had defensive injuries to his hands and arm, so it was clear that he had not been killed by the first or second blow. His suffering and terror must have been extensive. It was, on any view, a savage and pitiless murder. The applicant was arrested on 20 August 2021, for unrelated offences of affray and possession of a (different) claw hammer which he had brandished at a store security guard. His flat was searched, and two sledgehammers and two mallets were discovered and confiscated. Subsequently his DNA was recovered from Mr Kankanamalage's fingernails. The applicant was re-arrested on 21 January 2022 on suspicion of murder, and a further hammer and a cut-throat razer was found by his bed. The applicant denied murder. He said that he had taken a hammer to the park to strike trees to alleviate his tension. He also maintained that he had acted in lawful self-defence. At no point in the preparation for, or during the trial did the applicant accept that he had killed Mr Kankanamalage but that, due to a pre-existing mental condition, he was only guilty of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility. He was duly convicted of murder. The sentencing judge described his purported defence as ""a cock-and-bull story"". The Sentencing Exercise The sentencing judge provided detailed sentencing remarks which, in their written form, ran to 52 paragraphs. They are careful and considered. Since a life sentence was mandatory, the sentencing remarks explain the assessment of the appropriate minimum term which, as we have said, the sentencing judge fixed at 28 years, less time spent on remand. It was agreed that having taken the hammer to the park with an intent to kill or cause serious injury, the starting point for the minimum term, in the applicant's case, was one of 25 years (see paragraph 41 of the sentencing remarks). The judge then found a series of aggravating features beginning at paragraph 42. These included: (a) the very significant degree of planning and premeditation; (b) the extreme violence used in the killing, (including evidence that at least some of the wounds were consistent with being caused by the round head of the hammer whilst others were consistent with being caused by the claw end); (c) the fact that this was an attack on a stranger, in a public park at night and that in consequence Mr Kankanamalage was a vulnerable victim; (d) the applicant's previous convictions for a range of offences, including one incident in June 2011 involving sexual assault, battery, possession of an offensive weapon and criminal damage. On that occasion, amongst other things, the applicant brandished an axe at passengers on the District Line, pushing it in their faces and threatening them. We also note that, in another incident to which the sentencing judge referred (which happened the day after the murder, outside a shop in East London), the applicant produced a claw hammer and lifted it, threateningly, above his head whilst shouting at the security guard inside. Importantly, on that occasion, the applicant exercised sufficient self-control to walk away. That is something to which we will return later in this judgment. The judge found that the only mitigation was the personality disorder from which the applicant suffered, as explained in detail in a psychiatric report, produced by Dr Stephen Attard and dated 24 May 2024. The judge's sentencing remarks dealt with that report at paragraphs 27 to 38. In that context, the judge also had regard to the Sentencing Guideline in respect of Sentencing Offenders with Mental Disorders, which we shall call ""the relevant Guideline"". The crux of the judge's conclusions was as follows: ""34. In this regard the Guideline helpfully identifies a useful starting point to be to ask the questions identified in the Guideline. I have had regard to all such questions, however I consider the following to be of particular relevance:- 'At the time of the offence did the offender's impairment or disorder impair their ability: to exercise appropriate judgement to make rational choices to understand the nature and consequences of their actions?"". 35. I am greatly helped in this regard by the conclusions of Dr Attard at paragraph 243 of his report where he concludes: '243. In considering the above, it is likely that Mr Feld was experiencing a period of instability at the time of the index offence as a result of increased psychosocial stressors. The manifestations of his personality disorder were likely significant in regard his behaviour at the material time including his ability to exercise appropriate judgement, make choices and consider the nature and consequence of his actions, albeit not to a degree that substantially impaired his ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgement or exercise self control.' ( emphasis added) ."" 36. In such circumstances, and having heard all the evidence in the trial, and bearing in mind all that I know about you, whilst there was a reduction in culpability such reduction was only limited and certainly not significant not least given that the matters identified were not to a degree that substantially impaired your ability to understand the nature of your conduct or to form a rationale judgment or to exercise self-control. 37. I reject the submission that your disorder significantly reduced your culpability, and reject the submission that although your condition did not give rise to a defence of diminished responsibility the circumstances fell not far short of that. 38. In this regard I am satisfied that you understood perfectly well the nature of your conduct and that it was wrong to equip yourself with a hammer and to go out with the intention of killing a random stranger, that you retained the ability to form a rationale judgment as to just how wrong such conduct was, and I am satisfied that your ability to exercise self control was not substantially impaired. Rather, in such circumstances, you formed a deliberate intent to go out and carry into effect your long held fantasy to kill a random stranger for your own gratification."" We should also refer to two other paragraphs in the sentencing remarks because they go directly to some of the submissions made this morning by Mr Morris. They are paragraphs 45 and 46: ""45. The only real mitigation, such as it is, is your personality disorder. In this regard Schedule 21 paragraph 10(c) of the Sentencing Act 2020 identifies, as possible mitigation, 'the fact that the offender suffered from any mental disorder or mental disability' which '(although not falling within section 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957) lowered the offender's degree of culpability'. I have already addressed your personality disorder in detail above. As there identified I consider that whilst there was a reduction in culpability such reduction was only limited and certainly not significant not least given that the matters identified were not to a degree that substantially impaired your ability to understand the nature of your conduct or to form a rationale judgment or to exercise self-control."" Paragraph 46 then repeated paragraph 38, noted above. For these reasons the sentencing judge concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the one mitigating factor represented by the applicant's personality disorder. As he put it at paragraph 48 of the sentencing remarks: "" I have made an appropriate downwards adjustment from the substantially raised starting point to take account of your mitigation such as it is."" That resulted in an overall uplift from the original starting point of 25 years to one of 28 years, with an appropriate reduction for time spent on remand. The Grounds of Appeal There are three grounds of appeal. First, it is said that the judge failed properly to apply the statutory mitigating feature set out in paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020 (an offender suffering from a mental disorder). It is said that the judge confused that test with the potential defence of diminished responsibility and therefore underplayed the significance of the applicant's personality disorder in the sentencing exercise. Secondly, it is alleged the judge failed to follow the conclusions of Dr Attard to the effect that the mental disorder was a significant contributing factor to his culpability. Thirdly, it is said that the judge's treatment of the aggravating factors not only failed to reflect the applicant's mental disorder, but gave rise to an inflated starting point before any reduction for that disorder, which meant that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The Single Judge The single judge rejected those points when refusing permission to appeal. As to the first, he considered that the complaint was ""essentially semantic"": whilst the judge did, on occasion, use the language applicable for a defence of diminished responsibility, hence the reference to ""substantially impaired"", that reflected the language of the relevant Guideline that he was applying. He found that the sentencing judge had regard to the right test at paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21 because, amongst other things, he found that there was ""a reduction in culpability"". As to the wider question of Dr Attard's report, the single judge rejected the suggestion that the sentencing judge had somehow ignored Dr Attard's evidence. On the contrary, he said that the sentencing judge, although not bound by it, had in fact relied on the report in a number of important respects. He also said that the sentencing judge, having presided over the trial, had the benefit of considering all the evidence, not just the report of Dr Attard. The evidence as a whole was reflected in the sentencing remarks. As to the final point, concerned with the aggravating factors, the single judge noted that the applicant had other convictions for violence with weapons and that there were other significant aggravating factors. For these reasons, he concluded that the minimum term of 28 years was not excessive. The Renewed Application Hearing In the course of his clear submissions this morning, Mr Morris sought to renew the application for permission to appeal. Although he essentially restated the three points that we have already noted, we are happy to acknowledge both the clarity and thoughtfulness with which those submissions were advanced. We acknowledge that it is not easy for counsel in Mr Morris's position to seek to persuade a court that a minimum term imposed as a result of an horrific murder should somehow be reduced. Mr Morris's submissions properly recognised those difficulties but remained focused on the particular points he wanted to raise. We have given those three points considerable thought, and we shall explain our views on them in a moment. But we have concluded that the single judge was right to refuse permission to appeal. Our reasons are as follows. Ground 1: The Alleged Misapplication of Paragraph 10(C) Paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Act 2020 provides that mitigating factors that may be relevant to the offence of murder include the fact that the offender suffered from any mental disorder or mental disability which, although not falling within section 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957, lowered the offender's degree of culpability. The reference to section 2(1) is of course a reference to the defence of diminished responsibility. Whilst the relevant Guideline is too long to summarise properly in this judgment, we note that: (a) Paragraph 4 warns that mental disorders can fluctuate; (b) Paragraph 9 states that culpability may be reduced if an offender was, at the time of the offence, suffering from an impairment or disorder; (c) Paragraph 11 states that culpability will only be reduced if there is sufficient connection between the offender's impairment or disorder and the offending behaviour; (d) Paragraph 12 makes the obvious point that, in some cases, the impairment or disorder may mean that culpability is significantly reduced whilst in other cases the impairment or disorder may have no relevance to culpability at all; (e) Amongst the suggested questions in paragraph 15, the relevant Guideline asks whether, at the time of the offence, the disorder impaired the offender's ability to exercise appropriate judgment; to make rational choices; and to understand the nature and consequences of their actions. That last question was, of course, the question which the sentencing judge expressly asked himself in the passage from his sentencing remarks which we have already set out. Mr Morris's complaint under Ground 1 is that the judge confused the general test set out in paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 21, with the test for the sort of reduction in culpability required to make good a defence of diminished responsibility. In short, it was said that the bar was set too high. Putting it another way, as Mr Morris does at paragraph 30 of his grounds, he said that, whilst the evidence was that the applicant's ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control were not substantially impaired, his personality disorder was a significant contributing factor to his conduct and amounted to a significant mitigating factor. We understand why the single judge described this as a ""semantic"" argument. However, we acknowledge that there are passages in the judgment which might have given the impression that the judge was running the two tests together. But the position in principle, which we consider the judge properly followed, is straightforward. If an offender suffers from a mental disorder then, in accordance with paragraph 10(c), that may lower his or her degree of culpability, and in that way, it may amount to a mitigating factor. That is so even in circumstances where the disorder could not justify a submission, let alone a finding, of diminished responsibility. But the reason why it is a mitigating factor is because, as the relevant Guideline explains, it may reduce, even significantly reduce, the offender's culpability: the extent to which the offender is to blame for the crime. In this case, in accordance with paragraph 10(c) and the relevant Guideline, the sentencing judge found that the applicant did suffer from a personality disorder and that that did reduce his degree of culpability. So the only remaining issue was the question of degree or extent of the reduction. That was quintessentially a matter for the sentencing judge who, in this case, had also presided over the trial. So despite the language of some parts of the sentencing remarks, we are bound to reject the suggestion that the judge somehow became confused between the test identified in paragraph 10(c) and the test for diminished responsibility. In our judgment, he was always focused on the right test, namely whether there was a reduction in culpability at the time of the offence because of the personality disorder. That inevitably had an overlap with the test for diminished responsibility; indeed we note that that overlap was prayed in aid on behalf of the applicant, because in the sentencing note prepared by Mr Morris, he argued to the judge that although the ""applicant's condition did not give rise to a defence of diminished responsibility, it is open to the court to conclude that it did not fall too far short of that"". That submission was carefully considered by the judge and, in the passage that we have already identified, was rejected. Accordingly, in our view, the judge had in mind the right test under paragraph 10(c) and so, for the reasons that we have given, we reject Ground 1 of the appeal. Ground 2 - Dr Attard's Report Accordingly, this was a case where there was an accepted personality disorder, and the only question was the degree to which that reduced the applicant's culpability. Although, as we have said, that was quintessentially a matter for the sentencing judge (as the relevant Guideline explains at paragraph 13), Dr Attard's report was of assistance in arriving at an answer to that question. As we have said, Dr Attard was clear at paragraph 243 of his report that, at the time of the murder, the applicant's personality disorder did not substantially impair his ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control. In other words, his personality disorder did not/could not significantly reduce the applicant's culpability and therefore could not be a significant mitigating factor. On a proper analysis therefore, we consider that the judge was correct to approach the matter in the way that he did. We do not accept the suggestion that the judge did not have proper regard to Dr Attard's report. We consider that he had careful regard to what Dr Attard had said. We have already referred to paragraph 243, but there are other passages to which we would refer. We note, for example, that Dr Attard said that there was ""no evidence"" to suggest that the applicant was acutely psychotic at the time of the alleged offence (see paragraph 240 of the report). We note that, on the contrary, Dr Attard noted that the contemporaneous medical records showed that he was ""relatively stable"" in the months prior to the murder (see paragraph 237). We are also bound to note that at paragraphs 129 and 131 of the report, Dr Attard noted that various contemporaneous medical records, compiled following interviews and examinations shortly after the murder, recorded that there was ""no psychotic symptoms"" and that the applicant ""seemed calm... lucid and clear... He seemed to be himself."" We should also refer to the fact that, both in Dr Attard's report and in the evidence, there were a number of examples of incidents where the applicant had become consumed with ideas of rage and potential murder, but in which he had exercised self-control to walk away from those situations. The judge referred to that material in passing. He did not set it out in his sentencing remarks. It seems to us that that was a potentially important element of the background evidence and another reason why the judge was right to conclude, as Dr Attard had concluded, that the ability to exercise self-control was not substantially impaired and therefore was not a significant mitigating factor. It is also important to note, as we have recorded the single judge as saying, that Dr Attard's report was only one part of the material which the judge had to take into account when sentencing the applicant. The sentencing judge had presided over the trial and was therefore perfectly placed to reach a fully considered conclusion as to the degree of culpability of the applicant and the appropriate sentence. That is what paragraph 13 of the relevant Guideline stresses that the judge should do. Dr Attard's report was one, albeit very important, element of the material that was relevant to the sentencing exercise. For all those reasons therefore, we do not consider that Ground 2 is arguable. Ground 3 - The Aggravating Factors Finally, there is Mr Morris's submission about the aggravating factors which the sentencing judge took into account. It is said that the aggravating factors were symptoms of the applicant's mental disorder, so that the judge's treatment of them as aggravating factors was both erroneous and confusing. It is also separately said that the judge placed too much weight on them anyway, particularly the significant planning and premeditation. In our view, those criticisms are misplaced. As to the planning, the judge found that the applicant had carefully planned the murder and that included viewing the videos, before going out at night, to a location where he knew that potential victims would be present, having equipped himself with a hammer and concealed it in a bag. All of that was to give effect to the applicant's intention to murder a random stranger. That was a degree of planning which amounted to a significant aggravating factor. This was not the sort of murder that happened off the cuff, or randomly, or as a result of a spur of the moment incident. On this particular point, moreover, the sentencing judge expressly addressed the issue of whether the applicant's personality disorder negated or reduced the impact of the aggravating factor, and he explained why it did not: see paragraphs 38 and 46 of the sentencing remarks. Therefore, we are bound to agree with the sentencing judge, that the planning and premeditation were not explained by the personality disorder. The applicant, according to Dr Attard, was able to understand the nature of what he was preparing to do and yet failed to exercise any self-control. All of that goes to the first of the aggravating factors, namely the planning and premeditation, but the other aggravating factors, in our view, were not explained by the personality disorder in any event. Those included the extreme violence used in the killing, the vulnerability of the victim and the previous convictions. Accordingly, we conclude that the sentencing judge was entitled to find that the aggravating factors outweighed the single mitigating factor. Therefore, although the learned judge did not set out the detail of the calculation, having concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the single mitigating factor, he uplifted the starting point from 25 years to a minimum term of 28 years. We do not consider that that uplift was wrong in principle or erroneous in law. Accordingly, we reject the submission that the 28-year minimum term was manifestly excessive. We repeat our gratitude to Mr Morris for his careful submissions this morning, but this renewed application for permission to appeal must be refused. MR MORRIS: Could I ask for a representation order in this case? (The Bench Conferred) LORD JUSTICE COULSON: Mr Morris, I think the position is that, although we would, personally, grant you that order, we do not think we can because we have not granted you leave. MR MORRIS: I know in other renewed cases I have tried to get the Registrar to grant it in advance of the hearing, so I think I know the Registrar has powers. LORD JUSTICE COULSON: Let us leave it like this. If you communicate with the Registrar, now, you can say that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the Court would grant you a representation order, if it had the power. The Court freely accepts it does not know if it has the power; the Registrar will know. If we do have the power, you can have a representation order; if we do not, you cannot. Can we be any clearer? MR MORRIS: No, you cannot."

He had previously pleaded guilty to having an article with a blade or point. He had a co-accused who also was convicted of murder. The co-accused was a boy born on 19 January 2008. In the Crown Court an order was made pursuant to section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 that no matter relating to that individual may be published that would identify them, including their name, address, any educational establishment or workplace they may attend, or any picture of them. That order will remain in force until 19 January 2026. We shall refer to the co-accused as ""D"". Tyler Hunt was ordered to be detained at His Majesty's Pleasure with a period of 18 years and 63 days being specified as the minimum term. No separate penalty was imposed in relation to the offence of having a bladed article. His application for leave to appeal against the sentence has been referred to the full court by the Registrar. We shall give leave. D, who was 14 when the murder was committed, was also ordered to be detained at His Majesty's Pleasure. In his case the minimum term was 11 years and 81 days. At around lunchtime on 4 December 2022, Tyler Hunt and D rode on borrowed e-bikes from the Walcot area of Swindon to the north of the town near to a large shopping park. That was a trip of about eight miles. Hunt had suggested that the two of them should make this trip. They were dressed in black. They were wearing Balaclavas which left only their eyes visible. Each had an 18-inch machete down their trousers. They had bought the machetes at some point prior to 4 December. When they arrived in the area of the shopping park, Hunt and D spent about 40 minutes riding around. From what was seen by witnesses and from what could be seen on CCTV footage they appeared to be looking for someone or something. Just before 1.30 pm they were on a road called Mazurek Way, close to a children's playground. They had been there for about five minutes when an 18-year-old young male named Owen Dunn came towards them on his bicycle. Hunt and D did not know Owen Dunn. Dunn did not know them. As he rode up to Hunt and D, they got off their e-bikes. D shouted to Dunn asking who he was. Dunn did not reply. Hunt and D took out their machetes. As Dunn rode past them, Hunt swung his machete at Dunn. That blow did not land. D then stabbed towards Dunn with his machete. The blow was delivered with moderate force. The machete entered Dunn's chest to a depth of about six inches. It caused catastrophic injury to Dunn's lung and heart. Hunt swung a further blow but that missed. Dunn rode on for about 60 metres before he fell to the floor. He died within minutes. Hunt and D shouted out: ""Oh fuck, oh shit, he's down"". They remounted their e-bikes and rode away. They went to some nearby woods where they abandoned the e-bikes. At some point thereafter they got rid of the machetes. Hunt was not arrested until 7 March 2023. His involvement had become apparent because his movements could be tracked by the movement of an electronic tag he was wearing at the time. When he was interviewed he denied presence at the scene and involvement in the killing of Dunn. By the time of trial he accepted that he was at the scene. He said that he had done no more than act in reasonable self-defence when Dunn had produced a machete which he (Hunt) believed would be used against him and/or D. The trial judge found as a fact that Dunn had not produced any weapon nor had he made any aggressive move towards Hunt and D. Hunt had four previous court appearances relating to a total of eight offences. These predominantly were offences of relatively minor violence. On 4 December 2022 he was on bail for an offence of threatening behaviour. D had no previous court appearances. The judge referred to the victim personal statements she had received in received to Owen Dunn. She said this: ""I have read your moving victim personal statements and the wonderful vivid details of his life that brought to life his personality so well and I have considered grief at his loss with very great care."" The judge had reports in relation to Hunt and to D. Hunt had had a very difficult childhood. He had lived with his mother as a single parent. She sadly had significant problems with alcohol and her mental health. He had made significant progress whilst on remand at Parc YOI, making real progress academically. The judge had been able to observe Hunt when he was giving evidence. Her conclusion was that he was immature for his age. D had a close and supportive family. The judge considered that D was bright. He also had made a great deal of progress educationally during his time on remand at a secure children's home. The judge applied paragraph 5A of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Code when determining the starting point for the minimum term in each case. Had either defendant been an adult when the offence was committed, the minimum term would have been 25 years because the defendant had taken a weapon to the scene. D was 14 when he committed the offence. By reference to paragraph 5A his starting point was 13 years. Hunt was 17 when he committed the offence. Paragraph 5A provided a starting point of 23 years. The judge determined that there were no aggravating factors requiring an uplift to the starting points supplied by paragraph 5A. She found that neither defendant had an intent to kill, which amounted to mitigation. In relation to D she further mitigated the sentence to reflect the progress he had made at the secure children's home. She reduced the starting point from 13 to 12 years, namely a reduction of one year. The minimum term she imposed was to take account of time spent on remand. Hunt's sentence was mitigated because he had not caused injury to Owen Dunn and by reason of his troubled background. The judge reduced the starting point to 19 years, namely a reduction of four years. She referred to the comparative minimum terms, as between the two defendants, by saying: ""A greater disparity in sentence would also be unjust just for Tyler"". The meaning of that is opaque. We take it to mean that the judge adjusted the sentence in Hunt's case to ensure that the gap between his starting point and that of D was significantly less than that identified in paragraph 5A. The sole ground of appeal is that the gap in the minimum terms imposed on Hunt and D respectively led to injustice, whether this was an issue of disparity or a question of the judge failing to give sufficient weight to the mitigating factors relating to Hunt's disadvantaged childhood and his immaturity. Reliance is placed on what was said in R v Taylor [2007] EWCA Crim 803 and Attorney General References Nos 143 and 144 (R v Brown and Carty) [2007] EWCA Crim 1245 . The difficulty with drawing support from Taylor and Brown and Carty is that those cases dealt with the position prior to the introduction in 2022 of paragraph 5A. The context was explained in R v Kamarra-Jara [2024] EWCA Crim 198 at [32]: ""... where two or more offenders fall to be sentenced in respect of the same murder, some of whom are just over 18 and some of whom are just under 18, it would be neither just nor rational for significantly divergent terms to be imposed on grounds of age alone: see R v Taylor ... The proper approach is to move from each starting point to a position where any disparity is no more than a fair reflection of the age difference: see Attorney General's References Nos 143 and 144 (R v Brown and Carty) ... "" Prior to June 2022 any offender aged under 18 when the offence was committed using a weapon taken to the scene would have been subject to a starting point of 12 years, whereas an offender aged 18 would be subject to a starting point of 25 years. The authorities to which we have already referred sought to remedy the plain injustice that would result if someone a matter of months older than their co-accused had a starting point more than twice as long, simply due to a marginal difference in age. Paragraph 5A seeks to remedy that injustice by very significantly increasing the starting point for young defendants close to their 18th birthday. By that route significantly divergent terms as between those under 18 and those just over 18 on the face of it can be avoided. We do not address the position of whether it will be appropriate mechanistically to apply an adult starting point to an 18-year-old. That was the issue considered in Kamarra-Jarra where it was said at [33]: ""Age governs the normal starting point for a minimum term, but not the assessment of culpability by reference to maturity. The court is always obliged to look beyond mere chronological age."" The issue which arises in this case is the divergence between the minimum terms for a 14 year old, albeit one close to their 15th birthday, and for a 17-year-old who has another six months to go until their 18th birthday. Applying paragraph 5A arithmetically leads to a 10-year difference in the minimum terms for a murder committed using a weapon brought to the scene. This divergence is not the result, as it used to be, of a single starting point for the minimum term applying for every offence of murder committed by an offender under 18. Rather, the divergence is the result of the statutory scheme designed to cure what was seen to be the potential injustice created by a single minimum term for offenders under 18 when the offence was committed. The proposition being argued in this case must be that the statutory scheme itself is unjust. In oral argument Miss Jones on behalf of Tyler Hunt invited us to find that the table in Schedule 21 paragraph 5A does not reflect a case where different age groups appear together. We do not accept that proposition. Very many, if not almost all cases of murder, involving those under 18 are cases where two or more such young people are charged together. The notion that Parliament set out this schedule simply to deal with cases where a single offender was being sentenced is not tenable. Had that been Parliament's intention it would have said so in clear terms. It seems to us that the answer to the conundrum is what was said in Kamarra-Jarra . A judge sentencing two offenders for an offence of murder where both were under 18 when they committed the offence must look beyond mere chronological age. We take the ages of Hunt and D as an example. It might be that the older offender took the leading role in the offence and demonstrated a level of maturity at or beyond his chronological age, whereas the younger offender played a subsidiary part in the offence and lacked maturity. In those circumstances it may be that little adjustment would be needed to the starting points in paragraph 5A, prior to the consideration of other aggravating and mitigating factors. Where the younger offender showed maturity and played an active role in the murder, as opposed to the lesser role being played by an immature older offender, the position will be different. It will always be a matter for the judgment of the sentencing judge to balance the different factors to achieve a just result whilst taking into account the statutory framework provided by paragraph 5A. In this case the sentencing judge had heard the trial. She was best placed to determine the respective culpability of the offenders. She could not ignore the provisions of paragraph 5A. In our judgment she achieved as much as she could within the confines of those provisions to do justice to Taylor Hunt. Taken in isolation there can be no criticism of the minimum term fixed in his case. The judge was generous in not finding that the offence was aggravated by such matters as disposal of the evidence and planning of the offence. The mitigating factors were taken fully into account. Hunt's immaturity and his troubled childhood served to reduce the minimum term. The reduction applied by the judge was four years, which more than adequately reflected the available mitigation. If there remains any injustice due to the difference in the minimum terms we consider that this may be due to an unjustified degree of leniency afforded to D. He was almost 15 at the time of the murder. Paragraph 5A indicates a starting point of 17 years for a 15-year-old where a weapon is brought to the scene. Given his role in the offence and his background, it could be said that the judge ought to have increased rather than reduced the starting point of 13 years in D's case. Had she done so the divergence would have been significantly less. This court will not reduce an otherwise proper sentence because of the apparent disparity with a sentence more lenient than it should have been. In all of those circumstances, although we have given leave, we do not find that the sentence imposed on Tyler Hunt was manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. We dismiss his appeal.

In our judgment she achieved as much as she could within the confines of those provisions to do justice to Taylor Hunt. Taken in isolation there can be no criticism of the minimum term fixed in his case. The judge was generous in not finding that the offence was aggravated by such matters as disposal of the evidence and planning of the offence. The mitigating factors were taken fully into account. Hunt's immaturity and his troubled childhood served to reduce the minimum term. The reduction applied by the judge was four years, which more than adequately reflected the available mitigation. If there remains any injustice due to the difference in the minimum terms we consider that this may be due to an unjustified degree of leniency afforded to D. He was almost 15 at the time of the murder. Paragraph 5A indicates a starting point of 17 years for a 15-year-old where a weapon is brought to the scene. Given his role in the offence and his background, it could be said that the judge ought to have increased rather than reduced the starting point of 13 years in D's case. Had she done so the divergence would have been significantly less. This court will not reduce an otherwise proper sentence because of the apparent disparity with a sentence more lenient than it should have been. In all of those circumstances, although we have given leave, we do not find that the sentence imposed on Tyler Hunt was manifestly excessive or wrong in principle. We dismiss his appeal."

MRS JUSTICE CHEEMA-GRUBB: The applicant renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction after refusal by the single judge. On 16th April 2015, following a trial in the Crown Court at Chelmsford before His Honour Judge Ball QC and a jury, the applicant was convicted of murder. The evidence against him was overwhelming. On 22nd June 2015 he was sentenced to imprisonment for life. The period of 20 years and three months was specified as the minimum term under section 269(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The victim, Colin Evans, was 40 years old. He lived in a room above the Sanctus Café premises in Broomfield Road, Chelmsford with his dog Sweep. The accommodation, for homeless people, comprised three self-contained rooms with a communal kitchen, bathroom and toilet. Colin Evans' room was on the first floor along with the shared facilities. The two other rooms, which were occupied by Joel Calhoun and Nigel Burton, were on the second floor. At the end of September 2014 the applicant started to sleep rough in a local park, but from time to time he would stay in Mr Evans' room. Mr Evans would help him out. They were often seen together. In the days leading up to the murder the applicant was seen to be acting strangely. It was suspected that he was abusing drugs. Miss Ben-Younes, an employee of the Sanctus Café, saw the two men together on 29th September 2014 (the day of the murder). The other occupants (Mr Calhoun and Mr Burton) recalled seeing the deceased with the applicant that evening. Mr Calhoun had watched television with them in the deceased's room before leaving to go to his room to read and sleep. The applicant had been wearing a grey T-shirt with black sleeves and with the word ""Harlem"" on the front. CCTV footage of the area showed a male matching the applicant's description carrying a rucksack and walking a dog in the early hours of 30th September 2014. At about 8.24am, on 30th September, Miss Ben-Younes called the police. A short while before, upon entering the upstairs area of the café, she noticed that Sweep was not asleep on his bed in the kitchen. She called out for the deceased. She entered his room and saw his body in front of the sofa, covered in blood. One of the sofa cushions had been placed over his face. There was blood everywhere, with blood spray across the walls and blinds. He had been attacked with a sharp instrument. He had suffered multiple cuts and injuries, including two grave stab wounds to his neck and his side. The applicant's description was circulated. He was located in a nearby park with Sweep. The arresting officer noticed that he had dried blood around the area of his right ear. This was later found to be the blood of the deceased. He was wearing a watch, ring, clothing and trainers that belonged to the deceased. In interview with the police he provided a prepared statement in addition to answering some of the questions. He said that he had watched television with Mr Calhoun and the deceased. When Mr Calhoun had gone to bed, he and the deceased had continued watching television until they both fell asleep. He woke up at about 5am and took Sweep for a walk. He returned to the room shortly thereafter. The deceased was asleep and snoring. He left the room again at about 6.15am wearing some of Mr Evans' clothes. He insisted that when he left, the deceased was alive. At trial the applicant's defence was that he was not responsible for the murder which must have been committed by someone else. He gave evidence. He said that it was a lie to say that he was becoming mentally unwell. He had not said the strange things of which witnesses had accused. He did not steal the ring from the deceased but had paid him £20 for it. His account continued that on 29th September he had collected his belongings and taken them to Mr Evans' room. During the morning he had gone for a run. He got dog mess on his clothes and later took off his jeans and placed them in a bag. The ""Harlem"" T-shirt was his, but he had not worn it at any time that day. He said that he had stayed at the deceased's flat that evening. The atmosphere was good and they did not argue. At about 1am he decided to go for a walk in the park with Sweep prior to leaving Mr Evans. Mr Evans gave him his own watch so that the applicant would be aware of the time. Colin Evans was alive when he left. He spent around two hours in the park. When he returned, the deceased had been killed. He touched his wrist to try to find a pulse. He then became scared, took his possessions and the dog and left. He had started to go upstairs, but stopped in case the murderer was still present. He did not contact the police because he had previously been found guilty for nothing he had actually done in Portugal. He had lied in interview because he was confused and scared. The issue for the jury, therefore, was whether the applicant was the person who had murdered Mr Evans. The applicant faced the following evidence: (i) His unusual behaviour in the weeks leading up to the murder, which suggested that he had returned to drug abuse; (ii) Evidence that on the morning of 29th September 2014 he had picked up some of his belongings from his old room, including a multi-tool or Swiss army knife, the blade of which had not been recovered and which could have been used to cause the fatal wounds to Mr Evans. It was the prosecution's case that this knife had been disposed of by the applicant in the early hours of 30th September, after the murder. (iii) Views Mr Evans had expressed about the applicant on the morning of 29th September, which indicated that the generous, free accommodation he had been giving him may have been withdrawn. (iv) The ""Harlem"" T-shirt that the applicant had worn the night before was found bloodstained on the deceased's floor, along with a pair of jeans. Scientific examination demonstrated that they also bore the deceased's blood. (v) The applicant's DNA was found on the T-shirt. The blood pattern on the clothing of the T-shirt and jeans indicated that the clothes were worn by Mr Evans' killer at the time he was murdered. (vi) He was arrested in possession of the deceased's personal property. (vii) He had the deceased's blood around his right ear and also on the side of his face. (viii) The applicant's thumbprint in blood was identified from one of the blood marks on the wall in the deceased's property. Three legal rulings made by the trial judge are criticised by the applicant and form the basis for this renewed application. Firstly, the applicant wished to cross-examine Mr Calhoun, who was a prosecution witness. Although it was not part of the applicant's defence to assert that Mr Calhoun was the murderer, he was one of the few people with the opportunity to commit the offence (apart from the applicant himself). The applicant required the trial judge's leave before being able to put to Mr Calhoun questions about his bad character, namely, some previous criminal convictions for public order and similar offences, committed around the end of 2013, and before exploring suggestions that Mr Calhoun had mental health issues, had confessed to killing his own brother, and had made threats to kill staff at a job centre over a year earlier. This information had been provided to the defence in prosecution disclosure documents which stated that, when at a job centre at Waltham Cross in December 2012, Mr Calhoun had caused alarm to staff by making threats and also referred to the fact that Mr Calhoun told police he had been subject to sectioning under the Mental Health Act in the past. Any such application to introduce bad character of a non-defendant, which is contested, as this one was, must satisfy the test in section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. In summary, such evidence is only admissible if it is important explanatory evidence or it has substantial probative value in relation to a matter in issue which is of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole. The trial judge ruled that the evidence of Mr Calhoun's possible mental health issues and his antecedents appeared to relate to bizarre behaviour over a short period. Furthermore, the judge was not persuaded that the alleged relevance of this material was anything more than utterly speculative. He concluded that it did not have sufficient probative value in the proceedings. The applicant submits that the judge erred in refusing to admit this evidence. He argues that the jury were entitled to consider it because it was central to the defence case and the jury would have been free to reject it if they thought it irrelevant. This is to misunderstand the test the judge had to apply. It was for the judge to ascertain the potential relevance of the proposed questioning. We are not persuaded that it is arguable that he fell into error in concluding that it failed the test by some distance and was of insufficient probative value. Secondly, the prosecution sought a ruling on the bad character of the applicant himself, namely, evidence of previous convictions in Lisbon, Portugal for aggravated theft in 2009 and robbery in 2006, which were disputed by the applicant; and convictions recorded in Madeira, Portugal for aggravated theft in 2003 and robbery in 2006, which were not disputed. The application to adduce this evidence was objected to in its entirety, but the particular issue relevant to this application was the fact that the applicant denied that the offences in Lisbon related to him at all. The basis for the prosecution's application was that the convictions were relevant to the issue of whether the applicant had the propensity to engage in violence, in particular in circumstances where he acquired property belonging to others. Of course, the applicant was asserting, as we have said, in the instant case that the property belonging to Mr Evans, which he had possession of after the murder, had been given to him by the deceased. The trial judge ruled that all four recorded convictions met the statutory test, that is, for proving foreign convictions in section 7 of the Evidence Act 1851 and for the admission of a defendant's bad character by satisfying section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and that they could all be admitted. The applicant submits that the judge erred in admitting this evidence. He relies on the following: (a) the fact that no details or factual background was available for any of the four offences made the admission wholly unsatisfactory and prejudicial; (b) the fact that the applicant denied that two of the offences related to him at all made their admission particularly prejudicial and could have raised satellite issues in the minds of the jury; (c) furthermore, he submits that in due course during his summing-up the judge directed the jury in terms which suggested that they should disregard the two convictions the applicant did not accept should be attributed to him. If he was to give such a direction, then the evidence should not have been admitted at all. There is nothing in these complaints. The prosecution was in a position to prove all convictions against the applicant because properly certified documents from Portugal had been obtained. In due course, during his evidence the applicant admitted that he had been convicted of two of the offences (albeit he asserted wrongly so). Secondly, the convictions were relevant to two important matters in issue: the identity of the killer and the applicant's propensity to commit acts of violence, robbery and dishonesty. The Crown's case was, as we have observed, that after the murder the applicant stole some of the deceased's belongings. In the circumstances the prosecution had satisfied the test for admissibility under section 101(d) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 in that the convictions were relevant to an important matter in issue between the applicant and the Crown. Turning to the third argument, during his summing-up the trial judge directed the jury in this way. He explained the rationale for the admission of the previous convictions and directed the jury to be careful not to place a disproportionate significance on such evidence. He carefully reminded the jury that the picture was more complicated in the applicant's case because he denied the Lisbon convictions altogether and had explained that the Madeira convictions were not justly his. The judge reminded the jury of the applicant's case in respect of all four convictions. The judge concluded as follows (at page 40E): ""If they go into the scales in favour of the prosecution, they must go in very much as a matter of light weight, and solely to inform you that this is someone that does have the potential to be aggressive and violent towards somebody else. But, you could only use it in that way if you were sure that in fact he does have that past conduct against him, and you might, therefore, think out of absolute fairness, that it is best to disregard these matters. I cannot tell you as a matter of law you must disregard them, but you certainly must take care not to allow this information to decide the case and to sway it against him."" When considered in the full context of the summing-up, as we have summarised, it is clear that the judge set out the applicant's attitude to both pairs of recorded convictions and properly directed the jury that while the evidence was for them to consider, in all the circumstances they may wish to disregard them; or if they chose not to do so, they must not give them too much weight. This was a properly crafted direction which was more than fair to the applicant and did not undermine the judge's initial decision to admit the evidence. Finally, the applicant objected to the admission of graphical representations of the deceased's injuries, which included the especially serious neck wound in which both the carotid artery and jugular vein had been severed. We have seen the images. They are no more than pictorial illustrations of the injuries sustained by Colin Evans. The admission of such material can be fairly described as properly within the discretion of a trial judge. The applicant argued  and argues  that these images were simply too explicit and lifelike, albeit representations rather than photographs, and that their admission rendered the trial unfair. Having heard argument, the trial judge concluded that the images could properly be placed before the jury because they confirmed that the attack was significant and severe, with obvious deep and traumatic injuries, in particular around the deceased's throat. In the context of the issues in this case, it was necessary for the jury to know the detail of the injuries inflicted. In our judgment he was right to do so. There was pathological evidence that when the deceased's throat was injured the artery was severed, which would have caused blood to spurt violently from the wound. In support of that pathological evidence, there was clear evidence of a bloodstain in the pattern of an arterial spray on the applicant's T-shirt which had been abandoned in the deceased man's flat. There were signs in the shared bathroom of attempts to clean bloodstains. The finding of the deceased man's blood around the ear and side of the applicant's face was consistent with the murderer turning his face away from a stream of blood and, though making an attempt to clean it off himself, having failed to do so completely. It was the case for the applicant that he was not present at all during the attack and had simply later discovered the body. The jury would have to consider the nature of the injuries inflicted when deciding whether or not his account was credible. These images were graphic, but not as much as the photographs of the deceased man would have been. In all the circumstances it is not arguable that the judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in admitting the graphics. The matters raised in this renewed application do not begin to raise arguable grounds against the safety of the applicant's conviction for murder. Accordingly, the application is refused.  BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2016/693.html","Agrela, R. v [2016] EWCA Crim 693 (12 May 2016) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 693 Case No. 2015/02208/B4 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE TREACY MRS JUSTICE COX DBE and MRS JUSTICE CHEEMA-GRUBB DBE ____________________ R E G I N A - v - JOSE MANUEL CORREIA AGRELA ____________________ Computer Aided Transcription by Wordwave International Ltd trading as DTI 165 Fleet Street, London EC4A 2DY Telephone No: 020 7404 1400; Fax No 020 7404 1424 ( to the Court) ____________________ Non-Counsel Application ____________________ (AS APPROVED BY THE COURT) ____________________ LORD JUSTICE TREACY: I shall ask Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb to give the judgment of the court.

The blood pattern on the clothing of the T-shirt and jeans indicated that the clothes were worn by Mr Evans' killer at the time he was murdered. (vi) He was arrested in possession of the deceased's personal property. (vii) He had the deceased's blood around his right ear and also on the side of his face. (viii) The applicant's thumbprint in blood was identified from one of the blood marks on the wall in the deceased's property. Three legal rulings made by the trial judge are criticised by the applicant and form the basis for this renewed application. Firstly, the applicant wished to cross-examine Mr Calhoun, who was a prosecution witness. Although it was not part of the applicant's defence to assert that Mr Calhoun was the murderer, he was one of the few people with the opportunity to commit the offence (apart from the applicant himself). The applicant required the trial judge's leave before being able to put to Mr Calhoun questions about his bad character, namely, some previous criminal convictions for public order and similar offences, committed around the end of 2013, and before exploring suggestions that Mr Calhoun had mental health issues, had confessed to killing his own brother, and had made threats to kill staff at a job centre over a year earlier. This information had been provided to the defence in prosecution disclosure documents which stated that, when at a job centre at Waltham Cross in December 2012, Mr Calhoun had caused alarm to staff by making threats and also referred to the fact that Mr Calhoun told police he had been subject to sectioning under the Mental Health Act in the past. Any such application to introduce bad character of a non-defendant, which is contested, as this one was, must satisfy the test in section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. In summary, such evidence is only admissible if it is important explanatory evidence or it has substantial probative value in relation to a matter in issue which is of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole. The trial judge ruled that the evidence of Mr Calhoun's possible mental health issues and his antecedents appeared to relate to bizarre behaviour over a short period. Furthermore, the judge was not persuaded that the alleged relevance of this material was anything more than utterly speculative. He concluded that it did not have sufficient probative value in the proceedings. The applicant submits that the judge erred in refusing to admit this evidence. He argues that the jury were entitled to consider it because it was central to the defence case and the jury would have been free to reject it if they thought it irrelevant. This is to misunderstand the test the judge had to apply. It was for the judge to ascertain the potential relevance of the proposed questioning. We are not persuaded that it is arguable that he fell into error in concluding that it failed the test by some distance and was of insufficient probative value. Secondly, the prosecution sought a ruling on the bad character of the applicant himself, namely, evidence of previous convictions in Lisbon, Portugal for aggravated theft in 2009 and robbery in 2006, which were disputed by the applicant; and convictions recorded in Madeira, Portugal for aggravated theft in 2003 and robbery in 2006, which were not disputed. The application to adduce this evidence was objected to in its entirety, but the particular issue relevant to this application was the fact that the applicant denied that the offences in Lisbon related to him at all. The basis for the prosecution's application was that the convictions were relevant to the issue of whether the applicant had the propensity to engage in violence, in particular in circumstances where he acquired property belonging to others. Of course, the applicant was asserting, as we have said, in the instant case that the property belonging to Mr Evans, which he had possession of after the murder, had been given to him by the deceased. The trial judge ruled that all four recorded convictions met the statutory test, that is, for proving foreign convictions in section 7 of the Evidence Act 1851 and for the admission of a defendant's bad character by satisfying section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and that they could all be admitted. The applicant submits that the judge erred in admitting this evidence. He relies on the following: (a) the fact that no details or factual background was available for any of the four offences made the admission wholly unsatisfactory and prejudicial; (b) the fact that the applicant denied that two of the offences related to him at all made their admission particularly prejudicial and could have raised satellite issues in the minds of the jury; (c) furthermore, he submits that in due course during his summing-up the judge directed the jury in terms which suggested that they should disregard the two convictions the applicant did not accept should be attributed to him. If he was to give such a direction, then the evidence should not have been admitted at all. There is nothing in these complaints. The prosecution was in a position to prove all convictions against the applicant because properly certified documents from Portugal had been obtained. In due course, during his evidence the applicant admitted that he had been convicted of two of the offences (albeit he asserted wrongly so). Secondly, the convictions were relevant to two important matters in issue: the identity of the killer and the applicant's propensity to commit acts of violence, robbery and dishonesty. The Crown's case was, as we have observed, that after the murder the applicant stole some of the deceased's belongings. In the circumstances the prosecution had satisfied the test for admissibility under section 101(d) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 in that the convictions were relevant to an important matter in issue between the applicant and the Crown. Turning to the third argument, during his summing-up the trial judge directed the jury in this way. He explained the rationale for the admission of the previous convictions and directed the jury to be careful not to place a disproportionate significance on such evidence. He carefully reminded the jury that the picture was more complicated in the applicant's case because he denied the Lisbon convictions altogether and had explained that the Madeira convictions were not justly his. The judge reminded the jury of the applicant's case in respect of all four convictions. The judge concluded as follows (at page 40E): ""If they go into the scales in favour of the prosecution, they must go in very much as a matter of light weight, and solely to inform you that this is someone that does have the potential to be aggressive and violent towards somebody else. But, you could only use it in that way if you were sure that in fact he does have that past conduct against him, and you might, therefore, think out of absolute fairness, that it is best to disregard these matters. I cannot tell you as a matter of law you must disregard them, but you certainly must take care not to allow this information to decide the case and to sway it against him."" When considered in the full context of the summing-up, as we have summarised, it is clear that the judge set out the applicant's attitude to both pairs of recorded convictions and properly directed the jury that while the evidence was for them to consider, in all the circumstances they may wish to disregard them; or if they chose not to do so, they must not give them too much weight. This was a properly crafted direction which was more than fair to the applicant and did not undermine the judge's initial decision to admit the evidence. Finally, the applicant objected to the admission of graphical representations of the deceased's injuries, which included the especially serious neck wound in which both the carotid artery and jugular vein had been severed. We have seen the images. They are no more than pictorial illustrations of the injuries sustained by Colin Evans. The admission of such material can be fairly described as properly within the discretion of a trial judge. The applicant argued  and argues  that these images were simply too explicit and lifelike, albeit representations rather than photographs, and that their admission rendered the trial unfair. Having heard argument, the trial judge concluded that the images could properly be placed before the jury because they confirmed that the attack was significant and severe, with obvious deep and traumatic injuries, in particular around the deceased's throat. In the context of the issues in this case, it was necessary for the jury to know the detail of the injuries inflicted. In our judgment he was right to do so. There was pathological evidence that when the deceased's throat was injured the artery was severed, which would have caused blood to spurt violently from the wound. In support of that pathological evidence, there was clear evidence of a bloodstain in the pattern of an arterial spray on the applicant's T-shirt which had been abandoned in the deceased man's flat. There were signs in the shared bathroom of attempts to clean bloodstains. The finding of the deceased man's blood around the ear and side of the applicant's face was consistent with the murderer turning his face away from a stream of blood and, though making an attempt to clean it off himself, having failed to do so completely. It was the case for the applicant that he was not present at all during the attack and had simply later discovered the body. The jury would have to consider the nature of the injuries inflicted when deciding whether or not his account was credible. These images were graphic, but not as much as the photographs of the deceased man would have been. In all the circumstances it is not arguable that the judge erred in the exercise of his discretion in admitting the graphics. The matters raised in this renewed application do not begin to raise arguable grounds against the safety of the applicant's conviction for murder. Accordingly, the application is refused. "

LADY JUSTICE SIMLER: These are renewed applications for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence after refusal by the single judge. The applicant was convicted of murder (count 2) and violent disorder (count 1) in the Central Criminal Court on 3 April 2019 and was sentenced on the same date to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 27 years, less credit for days spent on remand, and a concurrent 30-month term in relation to the violent disorder. The facts can be summarised as follows. The violent disorder occurred sometime after 11 pm on Sunday 13 November 2017. Shortly before, the applicant's Honda moped arrived to join a white transit van parked up in a residential cul-de-sac in Burnett Close, Chingford. The van had been stolen and was carrying false number plates. The van then travelled to Orwell Court estate in Hackney with at least six occupants. Two male cyclists were targeted by the van and six occupants jumped out of it, chasing those cyclists. One of the men in the chasing group was brandishing a large knife and all had their faces covered. The cyclists managed to escape unhurt and the van continued with its occupants into Monteagle Way in Hackney. Just before midnight that evening, three men were sitting in a parked car on the Nightingale Estate in Monteagle Way. The white transit van drove past them and the occupants of that van appeared to the men in the car to be workmen wearing high visibility vests. One of the men in the car, Kaan Aslan, then aged 20, got out to fetch something from another car at which point he and his two friends, Ishmael William Thomas and Daniel Silver, were set upon by the occupants of the van which had reversed at speed to get to them. There were at least five men, possibly more, all wearing face coverings and armed with swords and knives. They repeatedly said words to the effect ""Where you lot from?"" The two men in the car managed to escape the scene, but Kaan Aslan was unable to do so. He was stabbed repeatedly and suffered a deep 12-centimetre stab wound which entered his heart. He also suffered a deep wound to his back which passed through part of his spine and there was a fragment of bone missing from his forearm. He tried to get away from the group and was screaming out in pain. A blood trail from the scene led to a grass area 30 feet away where he lay down. Eye witness accounts described the horrific attack and members of the public tried to help Kaan Aslan. Despite that, and the efforts of emergency services who attended at the scene, Kaan Aslan died from the catastrophic injury to his heart. After the violence, CCTV footage showed the van returning to Burnett Close and the Honda moped travelling back from there to the applicant's home address. The prosecution case was that the applicant murdered the deceased and took part in both violent disorders as part of a joint enterprise with the unidentified occupants of the white van. The violence was said to have been done to assert gang superiority and retribution for an earlier attack on the applicant's younger brother who had been stabbed seven times in Rectory Road in Hackney, the territory of a different gang, the Stokey/16 gang. The Crown relied on that earlier attack which occurred on 6 November 2017 as evidence of motive, the applicant's younger brother being a member of the E9/Niners gang. In terms of the evidence relied on by the Crown to establish that the applicant was the rider of the Honda moped and was present in the van at the material times, there was CCTV footage at 8.30 pm showing the applicant filling up his moped with petrol; there was a receipt for the petrol found on a search of his bedroom; CCTV footage captured the moped travelling to the cul-de-sac where the van was parked later that evening; cell site evidence linked the applicant and his mobile phones with the journey taken by the moped rider and then the transit van to the scenes of both the first violent disorder and then the second episode of violence and the murder; periods of inactivity on the phones corresponded with the timing of the attacks. There was also evidence of a crash helmet and gloves similar to those seen on the CCTV footage being worn by the moped rider found at the applicant's home and containing his DNA; and evidence linking the applicant to the transit van, including DNA evidence linking him to two high visibility vests recovered from the van in November 2017. The applicant gave no comment interviews and failed to mention to police a number of important facts relied on in his defence at trial, from which the jury were told they could draw adverse inferences. There was also bad character evidence in the form of CCTV footage of the applicant participating in a violent altercation whilst held on remand at HMP Belmarsh when he used a plastic tray as a weapon to support his younger brother or cousin who was involved in a fight during visiting time, admitted as evidence to correct the impression, wrongly given by the applicant during evidence, that he would not go to the assistance of his brother if circumstances such as a violent disorder of the kind here occurred. The defence case was that the applicant was at home throughout the time when the incidents took place. Another man, Mr Israel Ogunsola, who died on 4 April 2018, had come to the applicant's house that evening to borrow one of his mobile phones because it was a line used to sell cannabis, together with his moped, helmet and other items. He later returned with the moped, phone and other items, except the high visibility vests. He appeared to be flustered, said there had been ""a madness"" and then left. Since his death the applicant felt able to explain what had happened. The applicant in due course gave evidence at trial consistently with that defence. He explained that he had given a no comment interview on the advice of his solicitor and he relied on cell site expert evidence to rebut the prosecution evidence concerning his mobile phones. The issue for the jury at trial was whether they could be sure that the applicant was one of the men who attacked the cyclists in the violent disorder earlier in the evening and then went on to murder Kaan Aslan as part of a joint enterprise with the other occupants of the van. At the conclusion of the evidence, but before speeches and summing-up, the applicant's leading counsel, Ms Clare Wade QC, invited the judge to direct the jury that a finding of manslaughter was available as an alternative verdict to the count of murder and should be left to the jury. Although the applicant's defence was that he had not been party to any agreement to commit any of the offences and had been at home at all material times, it was open to the jury to reject that account and Ms Wade submitted on his behalf that there was a clear inference that the occupants of the van had agreed to commit a violent disorder in the second part of the evening, just as they had in the first part. For example, some had engaged in conduct such as banging knives or swords on the bonnet of the cars in Monteagle Way, consistent with conduct intended to cause fear as opposed to conduct intended to kill or do really serious harm. She relied on the absence of any witness to the stabbing of the deceased and also on the fact that the Crown's pathologist, Mr Robert Chapman, said that ""a single knife could have accounted for all the injuries"" but was unable to say if one or more than one knife was used. She submitted that if there had been an agreement only to commit violent disorder, then given that some or all of the occupants of the van were armed with knives it was reasonably foreseeable that some harm would occur and manslaughter should therefore be left to the jury as an alternative possible verdict. The trial judge, Her Honour Judge Poulet QC declined to direct the jury on the possibility of an alternative verdict of manslaughter. The jury had an alternative to murder in the form of a finding of violent disorder which carried a less serious penalty than the offence of manslaughter. There could therefore, be no unfairness to the applicant if manslaughter was not left to the jury. The trial judge concluded that leaving a further alternative of manslaughter would have been confusing. In those circumstances, the jury were directed that if they were sure the applicant was present but did not intend to cause really serious harm to the deceased, they could consider as an alternative to murder a conviction of violent disorder. On this renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction, there is one ground only now pursued by Ms Wade who appears with Mr Christian Wasunna, on the applicant's behalf. They argue that the conviction of murder is unsafe because the jury was not directed that the alternative verdict of manslaughter was open to them on that count. Ms Wade accepts that the directions given on violent disorder as an alternative verdict were proper directions, but disputes that this achieved the broader aim of meeting the interests of justice in this case as set out in R v Coutts [2007] 1 CrAppR 6 . In this case, by contrast with Coutts , a manslaughter direction was specifically requested at the close of the evidence and in circumstances where the Crown could not say whether the applicant was a principal or a secondary party in so far as the fatal injuries were concerned. Furthermore, as she did below, Ms Wade relies on the pathologist's evidence and the inability to say that more than one knife had been used, or that more than one person had caused the injuries. She submits, given the evidence of the banging of weapons, which was consistent with unlawful violence or threats of unlawful violence such as to cause fear, the evidence lent itself to the inference that the applicant had participated in an attack consisting of violence falling short of an intention to cause really serious harm or kill. She relies on the fact that the applicant was not a member of a gang and would not therefore necessarily have foreseen that one of the participants would have stabbed the deceased. The alternative of violent disorder is not the alternative contemplated by section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. Moreover, in circumstances such as these, R v Jogee (at paragraph 96) supports the conclusion that manslaughter is the appropriate alternative envisaged. Critically she submits, an alternative of violent disorder simply did not give the jury a realistic choice in the circumstances of this case. It was too trifling an offence that did not reflect the full consequences of what occurred and the fact that a death had resulted. Forcefully and cogently as this ground was advanced on the applicant's behalf, like the single judge we do not accept that it raises any arguable case that the applicant's conviction of murder is unsafe. We are quite sure that it was neither necessary nor in the interests of justice on the facts of this particular case for an alternative verdict of manslaughter to be left to the jury. Our reasons in summary are as follows. The central issue for the jury was not one of intent on the evidence but whether they were sure that the applicant was present in the van on Monteagle Way that night. There was compelling circumstantial evidence that he was. There was also compelling evidence, not least from Ishmael William Thomas and Daniel Silver, that all of the attackers from the van were armed with knives and/or swords capable of inflicting fatal violence. There was evidence of repeated attempts made to stab Ishmael William Thomas through the window of the car and both men gave evidence that they were in fear for their and each other's lives. The cumulative effect of the evidence of these witnesses and the other evidence was that all of the attackers were armed and that the ferocity of the attack was such that it could properly be inferred that the group was intent on causing at least really serious bodily harm To convict the applicant of manslaughter, the jury would have had to be sure that he intentionally participated in an offence in which Kaan Aslan died and that a reasonable person would have realised in the course of that offence that some physical harm might be caused. Neither factual scenario was consistent with his case which was that he was not in the van and had not been present at the scene of the attack at all. That meant that before any consideration could be given to manslaughter, the jury would have had to dismiss his account as a lie and then, without any realistic evidential basis for doing so, attempt to guess at his state of mind. In this case we are quite sure that the alternative verdict of violent disorder catered for the possibility that the jury were sure that the applicant was present in Monteagle Way but not sure that he intended at least really serious harm should be caused to Kaan Aslan. That was a suitable lesser alternative that specifically addressed the unlikely conclusion that the jury were sure only that he had taken part in the general violence without the necessary intention. As R v Coutts makes clear, before any requirement to leave an alternative verdict arises it must be obviously raised by the evidence. That is, it must be an alternative verdict which a jury could reasonably come to. The obvious alternative here was violent disorder. Manslaughter was not obviously raised by the evidence. Once the jury were satisfied that the applicant was in the van and therefore either participating in or encouraging the violence that evening, there was compelling evidence that entitled the jury to conclude that he intended at least really serious harm should be caused. The judge expressly directed the jury that this was required and by their verdict reached unanimously, it is clear this is what they concluded. Accordingly, in our judgment it was not necessary for the judge to leave the alternative of manslaughter to the jury and this conviction is not arguably unsafe. We turn to the application for leave to appeal against the minimum term of 27 years imposed in respect of the murder conviction. Two particular points are emphasised by Ms Wade in contending that the sentence was manifestly excessive. First, she submits it could not be said that the applicant had an intention to kill since there was no evidence that he was the person who inflicted the injuries on Kaan Aslan. This was a statutory mitigating factor but the sentencing judge made no finding in this regard and her sentencing remarks indicate that the only mitigating features she identified were the applicant's age, she observed he had only just turned 23, and that he was not alleged to be a member of any gang. Secondly, she submits that there should have been greater weight afforded to those mitigating features in any event. There is a third point raised in oral submissions: that there was an element of double-counting by the judge in that she regarded the offence as aggravated by the fact that others were armed but this was catered for in any event by the starting point of 25 years. We do not accept those submissions. The offence, as Ms Wade concedes, fell within paragraph 5A of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 as a murder in which knives or similar weapons are taken to the scene. That meant a starting point, before taking into account any additional aggravating features, of 25 years. As far as aggravating features are concerned, there was significant planning involved. It was group violence - these participants went mob-handed and armed. In our judgment the judge was amply entitled to treat that as a separate aggravating feature beyond simply the paragraph 5A circumstances. The weapons taken were capable of inflicting fatal violence. The offence was a revenge attack involving rival gangs. There was the use of a stolen van to transport the attackers to two separate rival locations in search of victims - a search that was persistent and sustained - and efforts were made to conceal the identity of those involved. The offence took place on the streets at night with two others on Monteagle Way narrowly escaping serious injury and in addition, the murder followed the earlier violent disorder that evening. As for mitigating features, although not dealt with expressly in her sentencing remarks, in our judgment there was ample evidence entitling the judge to find an intention to kill proved on the evidence of motive and given the nature and ferocity of the attack. In these circumstances, an increase of two years from the starting point was not arguably manifestly excessive after mitigating the term to reflect the applicant's age and that he was not alleged to have gang membership. For all these reasons, both applications are refused. Epiq Europe Ltd hereby certify that the above is an accurate and complete record of the proceedings or part thereof.

At the conclusion of the evidence, but before speeches and summing-up, the applicant's leading counsel, Ms Clare Wade QC, invited the judge to direct the jury that a finding of manslaughter was available as an alternative verdict to the count of murder and should be left to the jury. Although the applicant's defence was that he had not been party to any agreement to commit any of the offences and had been at home at all material times, it was open to the jury to reject that account and Ms Wade submitted on his behalf that there was a clear inference that the occupants of the van had agreed to commit a violent disorder in the second part of the evening, just as they had in the first part. For example, some had engaged in conduct such as banging knives or swords on the bonnet of the cars in Monteagle Way, consistent with conduct intended to cause fear as opposed to conduct intended to kill or do really serious harm. She relied on the absence of any witness to the stabbing of the deceased and also on the fact that the Crown's pathologist, Mr Robert Chapman, said that ""a single knife could have accounted for all the injuries"" but was unable to say if one or more than one knife was used. She submitted that if there had been an agreement only to commit violent disorder, then given that some or all of the occupants of the van were armed with knives it was reasonably foreseeable that some harm would occur and manslaughter should therefore be left to the jury as an alternative possible verdict. The trial judge, Her Honour Judge Poulet QC declined to direct the jury on the possibility of an alternative verdict of manslaughter. The jury had an alternative to murder in the form of a finding of violent disorder which carried a less serious penalty than the offence of manslaughter. There could therefore, be no unfairness to the applicant if manslaughter was not left to the jury. The trial judge concluded that leaving a further alternative of manslaughter would have been confusing. In those circumstances, the jury were directed that if they were sure the applicant was present but did not intend to cause really serious harm to the deceased, they could consider as an alternative to murder a conviction of violent disorder. On this renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction, there is one ground only now pursued by Ms Wade who appears with Mr Christian Wasunna, on the applicant's behalf. They argue that the conviction of murder is unsafe because the jury was not directed that the alternative verdict of manslaughter was open to them on that count. Ms Wade accepts that the directions given on violent disorder as an alternative verdict were proper directions, but disputes that this achieved the broader aim of meeting the interests of justice in this case as set out in R v Coutts [2007] 1 CrAppR 6 . In this case, by contrast with Coutts , a manslaughter direction was specifically requested at the close of the evidence and in circumstances where the Crown could not say whether the applicant was a principal or a secondary party in so far as the fatal injuries were concerned. Furthermore, as she did below, Ms Wade relies on the pathologist's evidence and the inability to say that more than one knife had been used, or that more than one person had caused the injuries. She submits, given the evidence of the banging of weapons, which was consistent with unlawful violence or threats of unlawful violence such as to cause fear, the evidence lent itself to the inference that the applicant had participated in an attack consisting of violence falling short of an intention to cause really serious harm or kill. She relies on the fact that the applicant was not a member of a gang and would not therefore necessarily have foreseen that one of the participants would have stabbed the deceased. The alternative of violent disorder is not the alternative contemplated by section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. Moreover, in circumstances such as these, R v Jogee (at paragraph 96) supports the conclusion that manslaughter is the appropriate alternative envisaged. Critically she submits, an alternative of violent disorder simply did not give the jury a realistic choice in the circumstances of this case. It was too trifling an offence that did not reflect the full consequences of what occurred and the fact that a death had resulted. Forcefully and cogently as this ground was advanced on the applicant's behalf, like the single judge we do not accept that it raises any arguable case that the applicant's conviction of murder is unsafe. We are quite sure that it was neither necessary nor in the interests of justice on the facts of this particular case for an alternative verdict of manslaughter to be left to the jury. Our reasons in summary are as follows. The central issue for the jury was not one of intent on the evidence but whether they were sure that the applicant was present in the van on Monteagle Way that night. There was compelling circumstantial evidence that he was. There was also compelling evidence, not least from Ishmael William Thomas and Daniel Silver, that all of the attackers from the van were armed with knives and/or swords capable of inflicting fatal violence. There was evidence of repeated attempts made to stab Ishmael William Thomas through the window of the car and both men gave evidence that they were in fear for their and each other's lives. The cumulative effect of the evidence of these witnesses and the other evidence was that all of the attackers were armed and that the ferocity of the attack was such that it could properly be inferred that the group was intent on causing at least really serious bodily harm To convict the applicant of manslaughter, the jury would have had to be sure that he intentionally participated in an offence in which Kaan Aslan died and that a reasonable person would have realised in the course of that offence that some physical harm might be caused. Neither factual scenario was consistent with his case which was that he was not in the van and had not been present at the scene of the attack at all. That meant that before any consideration could be given to manslaughter, the jury would have had to dismiss his account as a lie and then, without any realistic evidential basis for doing so, attempt to guess at his state of mind. In this case we are quite sure that the alternative verdict of violent disorder catered for the possibility that the jury were sure that the applicant was present in Monteagle Way but not sure that he intended at least really serious harm should be caused to Kaan Aslan. That was a suitable lesser alternative that specifically addressed the unlikely conclusion that the jury were sure only that he had taken part in the general violence without the necessary intention. As R v Coutts makes clear, before any requirement to leave an alternative verdict arises it must be obviously raised by the evidence. That is, it must be an alternative verdict which a jury could reasonably come to. The obvious alternative here was violent disorder. Manslaughter was not obviously raised by the evidence. Once the jury were satisfied that the applicant was in the van and therefore either participating in or encouraging the violence that evening, there was compelling evidence that entitled the jury to conclude that he intended at least really serious harm should be caused. The judge expressly directed the jury that this was required and by their verdict reached unanimously, it is clear this is what they concluded. Accordingly, in our judgment it was not necessary for the judge to leave the alternative of manslaughter to the jury and this conviction is not arguably unsafe. We turn to the application for leave to appeal against the minimum term of 27 years imposed in respect of the murder conviction. Two particular points are emphasised by Ms Wade in contending that the sentence was manifestly excessive. First, she submits it could not be said that the applicant had an intention to kill since there was no evidence that he was the person who inflicted the injuries on Kaan Aslan. This was a statutory mitigating factor but the sentencing judge made no finding in this regard and her sentencing remarks indicate that the only mitigating features she identified were the applicant's age, she observed he had only just turned 23, and that he was not alleged to be a member of any gang. Secondly, she submits that there should have been greater weight afforded to those mitigating features in any event. There is a third point raised in oral submissions: that there was an element of double-counting by the judge in that she regarded the offence as aggravated by the fact that others were armed but this was catered for in any event by the starting point of 25 years. We do not accept those submissions. The offence, as Ms Wade concedes, fell within paragraph 5A of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 as a murder in which knives or similar weapons are taken to the scene. That meant a starting point, before taking into account any additional aggravating features, of 25 years. As far as aggravating features are concerned, there was significant planning involved. It was group violence - these participants went mob-handed and armed. In our judgment the judge was amply entitled to treat that as a separate aggravating feature beyond simply the paragraph 5A circumstances. The weapons taken were capable of inflicting fatal violence. The offence was a revenge attack involving rival gangs. There was the use of a stolen van to transport the attackers to two separate rival locations in search of victims - a search that was persistent and sustained - and efforts were made to conceal the identity of those involved. The offence took place on the streets at night with two others on Monteagle Way narrowly escaping serious injury and in addition, the murder followed the earlier violent disorder that evening. As for mitigating features, although not dealt with expressly in her sentencing remarks, in our judgment there was ample evidence entitling the judge to find an intention to kill proved on the evidence of motive and given the nature and ferocity of the attack. In these circumstances, an increase of two years from the starting point was not arguably manifestly excessive after mitigating the term to reflect the applicant's age and that he was not alleged to have gang membership. For all these reasons, both applications are refused. Epiq Europe Ltd hereby certify that the above is an accurate and complete record of the proceedings or part thereof.

The judgment of the Court on that occasion set out fully the facts and provides the reasons why it was thought right to adjourn the matter on that occasion. It is unnecessary to do more than refer to that judgment and outline the position, very briefly, for the purposes of giving the final ruling on this appeal. The appellant had been convicted of murder. His defence had been that he was not responsible in any way for the deceased's death. No defence of diminished responsibility was run in the alternative or at all. Following the conviction, the psychiatrist who had examined the appellant prior to the trial, that is a Dr Bond, re-examined the appellant. During this interview the appellant accepted responsibility for the killing and Dr Bond came to the conclusion that it was strongly arguable that the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing. It was also clearly arguable that the appellant's mental responsibility for his acts were substantially impaired at the time of the killing but Dr Bond said that that was a matter for the jury. Prior to the previous hearing, the Crown also consulted a psychiatrist, a Dr Kennedy. Dr Kennedy produced a report which, if anything, was rather stronger, so far as the appellant's case was concerned in relation to establishing that he suffered from an abnormality of the mind at the time of the killing. But Dr Kennedy also expressed the view that it was a matter for the jury as to whether that abnormality of mind substantially impaired the appellant's responsibility. On that last occasion, the Court was concerned about two factors and ruled that the evidence of the psychiatrists should be admitted at that stage, but thought that further reports should be obtained from the psychiatrists. The Court was of the view that the psychiatrists could be of more assistance in giving opinions as to the impairment of responsibility. The Court was also of the view that it was of materiality to the question as to whether the appeal should be allowed, whether the appellant's mental faculties had in any way prevented him giving rational instructions as to his defence at his trial. What was said on that last occasion was this: ""But equally, if there was overwhelming or clear evidence to demonstrate that a defence of diminished responsibility would have succeeded and there was clear evidence that the mental illness itself was a cause of a decision taken to run such defences as were run, or putting it another way not to run the defence of diminished responsibility, then the interests of justice would seem to require probably the substitution of a verdict of manslaughter but at least to order a retrial."" So the matter was adjourned on that last occasion to give the psychiatrists a further opportunity to consider the position, and both be available to give evidence, if necessary, on the appeal. The position as at today's date, this resumed hearing, is that two further reports have been produced, again one from Dr Bond and one from Dr Kennedy. Mr Saunders has read out and has opened today the material parts of the opinions expressed by those two doctors. It is clear from the opinions expressed by both of them that the abnormality of mind from which the appellant suffered did substantially impair his mental responsibility as at the time of the killing. It is also clear, from both opinions, that the abnormality of mind also impaired the appellant's ability to give rational instructions. He, in their view, would have been likely to be very suspicious of the psychiatrists who were seeing him and of his legal advisers, and that may well have been the reason why he ran the defence that he did, which was that he had no responsibility at all. The evidence indeed is so powerful on this occasion that the Crown accept that, provided of course this Court approves, that the appropriate course in this case is for there to be a substitution for the verdict of guilty of murder, a verdict of guilty of manslaughter. We have no doubt that, in the light of the two reports of Dr Kennedy and Dr Bond, it is appropriate that there should be a substitution. In those circumstances, the appeal must be allowed, and a verdict of manslaughter substituted for that of murder. As regards sentence, the position of course was that for the offence of murder, a life sentence was mandatory, and there was a recommendation that the appellant should serve at least 18 years. That recommendation was not challenged on appeal, no doubt because of the circumstances of the killing, and the danger that the appellant posed. On this occasion, of course, the matter is very different. It must, first, be said that neither psychiatrist has been able to recommend a hospital order. The reason for that is that at the present stage it is felt that the appellant is not susceptible to treatment. The position though, of course, also is that the appellant does still pose a very real danger. In those circumstances, the only course we feel open to this Court is to impose a life sentence, which will mean that the appellant cannot be released while he poses that threat. We then have to consider what recommendation should be made. The exercise we must go through is as follows. Having passed the life sentence which deals with the very serious danger that the appellant is, we must now go through the exercise of considering what determinant sentence might have been passed on a finding of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The position, of course, is that the culpability for this offence, having regard to the mental impairment, must reduce the responsibility. In our view, the appropriate sentence, if one was passing a determinate sentence would have been one of 8 years. It follows that, in our view, the period that the appellant must serve before he can apply for parole should be calculated by reference to that determinate sentence. In our judgment, the appropriate period is one of 5 years. We accordingly substitute a sentence of life imprisonment, but with a recommendation that 5 years be served prior to any right to apply for parole. We, of course, emphasise, so that there is no misunderstanding, that the appellant will be detained well after that period of 5 years, if he is not safe to be released. We feel it is also right to say that the stage may come when the Home Secretary feels it is sensible to have the appellant transferred to a hospital. Nothing we have said should prevent that course being taken. In those circumstances, this appeal is allowed and the sentence becomes that which we have indicated. © 1998 Crown Copyright BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1998/1632.html","Borthwick, R v [1998] EWCA Crim 1632 (18 May 1998) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions , [1998] Crim LR 274 KEVAN BORTHWICK, R v.

The appellant had been convicted at the Central Criminal Court on 22nd May 1998, following a trial before His Honour Judge Hutchinson and he had been sentenced to life imprisonment following his conviction for murder. The facts can, for present purposes, be very shortly stated. In the early hours of Sunday 7th December 1997, following an earlier encounter between them, an hour or two before, the appellant used violence to a man called Anthony Gray which caused his death. The defence of diminished responsibility was not run at the appellant's trial because he did not wish it to be run. But there was abundant evidence which justified the Court, as we have already indicated, quashing that conviction, when evidence was presented for it in support of the defence of diminished responsibility. The question which arises today is what, following the conviction for manslaughter, should be the appropriate penalty in this case? There are a number of reports of a medical character before this Court, a number of which have been previously before the courts. The two most recent reports come from Dr Hamilton, dated 27th April 1999, and Dr Akinkunmi, dated 26th April 1999. Those reports, in confirmation of the views expressed in the earlier reports, to which it is unnecessary specifically to refer, confirm, with one voice, that the appellant sadly suffers from a mental illness and it is of a nature and degree making it appropriate that he be detained in hospital. Dr Akinkunmi has given evidence in support of his report before this Court today. His conclusion is that the most suitable method of dealing with the appellant is by means of a hospital order under section 37 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Furthermore, it is the view of the doctors, confirmed by Dr Akinkunmi in his oral evidence before the Court, that the nature of this offence and the risk of further offences being committed is such that it is necessary to protect the public from serious harm by a restriction order under section 41 of the same Act without limit of time. That accordingly is the sentence which we pass: a section 37 order together with a section 41 restriction order, without limit of time. © 1999 Crown Copyright BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/1225.html","Weekes, R v [1999] EWCA Crim 1225 (4th May, 1999) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions STEPHEN WEEKES, R v.

The minimum term for the sentence of life imprisonment was 23 years less 546 days spent on remand. The applicant seeks to renew her application for leave to appeal against that sentence, leave having been refused by the single judge. Factual background As of July 2015, the applicant, then aged 16, was in a relationship with Karim Hussain, who was then aged 17. On 20 July 2015 the couple had spent the morning at the applicant's house. They argued and the police were called. Hussain was asked to leave but he returned later that afternoon to collect a mobile phone charger. The applicant, who was under the influence of cannabis, was not pleased to see him but let him in. As Hussain went to unplug his charger the applicant stabbed him three times with a knife. The injuries were to his back, below the left shoulder blade, in the left armpit and to his left forearm. There were further defensive injuries to Hussain's left hand. The applicant denied any involvement in the stabbing, suggesting instead that Hussain had been stabbed in the street by someone unknown. Hussain went along with this version at the time because he was in love with the applicant and did not want to be considered a snitch. She was not charged with that offence at the time. By March 2021 the applicant, who was then aged 22 and who had by then served time in a young offender institution for robbery offences committed in 2017, had been in a relationship with Tai O'Donnell for about a year. The relationship was described as ""volatile"" with neighbours reporting frequent arguments. On 24 February 2021 the applicant broke a window in O'Donnell's flat to gain access and let herself in. On 2 March 2021 she removed the boarding from the broken window and entered the flat again. At 03.27 in the morning on 3 March 2021 the applicant sent a message to her friend saying that she had stabbed someone and that nobody was helping her clean up. O'Donnell had been stabbed four times to his back, to the back of his right thigh and twice to the back of his left thigh. One of the stab wounds penetrated to a depth of 11 centimetres and almost severed his femoral artery. That last wound was fatal. It was found that the applicant had been angered by O'Donnell's wish to end the relationship. The applicant sent O'Donnell text messages in the weeks leading up to the offence. These included a threat to stab him and made reference to her having three knives hidden in her room. O'Donnell told his mother and grandfather of the threats she had previously made towards him. He also told a friend, Sarah Boyle, of an occasion when the applicant produced a knife in his home. The pathologist concluded that O'Donnell did not die immediately. A makeshift tourniquet had been applied but it was too low to have been effective. The applicant knew that O'Donnell did not have a telephone and she did not call for help herself. She cleaned bloodstains from the bed clothing and elsewhere in the flat. The emergency services were called by O'Donnell's neighbour, Miss Gonzalez, at just after 12 o'clock on 3 March. She claimed to have gone to his house and seen him lying on the sofa with blood all over the room and on the doorstep. Paramedics arrived at 12.16 and found O'Donnell's body on the living room sofa. Gonzalez did not tell them that the applicant was at her mother's address a short distance away. Instead, Gonzalez falsely claimed that a girl she did not know had been at the flat when she arrived and that the girl had left. When a police constable accompanied Gonzalez back to her address, she falsely told him that the applicant was her sister. The applicant left Gonzalez' mother's address at just after 1 o'clock. She disposed of the murder weapon, her mobile phone and the clothes she had been wearing. On the following morning the applicant told the probation service and a police officer who went to her mother's house to arrest her that the killing had nothing to do with her. Hussain subsequently decided to tell the police about the applicant stabbing him. At trial the applicant ran a case of self-defence in respect of both counts. In sentencing the applicant, the judge rejected the suggestion that the applicant was a victim in either of the relationship with Hussain and O'Donnell. He concluded that the ""preponderance of the evidence"" put before the jury pointed in the other direction to ""you being the controlling and coercive partner."" The judge said he could not be sure that the applicant took a knife to the scene and therefore applied a starting point for the minimum term of 15 years. Having taken account of the numerous aggravating features, including the failure to call for help, the attempts to conceal her actions, the previous threats of violence and her previous convictions, and the mitigating features including the absence of any intention to kill, her age and her background, the judge considered that the appropriate minimum term if sentencing for the murder alone would be 20 years. As for count 1, the wounding with intent, the judge considered that this was a high culpability offence given the persistent nature of the attack on Hussain, but that the injuries were not as serious as they could so easily have been. As such the judge considered that this was a Category 2A offence with a starting point of five years and a range of four to seven years. Taking account of all the relevant factors in relation to that offence, the judge imposed a sentence of seven years to run concurrently. Finally, taking account of totality, the judge increased the minimum term on count 3 to 23 years to reflect the overall criminality involved in the two offences. Grounds of appeal Miss Jones KC appears for the applicant before us, as she did below, and relies on four grounds of appeal: The minimum term in respect of the murder offence was too long. The learned judge erred in making a factual finding that the applicant had not been the victim of domestic violence. Inadequate allowance was made for the applicant's age at the time of the section 18 offence. Insufficient allowance was made for totality. In refusing leave, the single judge said as follows: ""You fell to be sentenced for wounding with intent of a previous partner and for murder of another following your trial. The jury rejected that you were acting on occasion in self-defence. In relation to the murder sentence the Judge took the appropriate starting point of 15 years. Although he accepted that you did not have an intent to kill, there were significant aggravating factors to the offence. You inflicted four knife wounds to the rear of the deceased's body in his own home to which you had gained access. The Judge found, as he was entitled on the evidence and well-placed having presided over your trial so to do, that you acted out of anger. This was against the background of earlier threats to stab him. There was evidence that the deceased would have survived if you had called assistance. You did not do so. There was evidence that he survived for up to 30 minutes. He did not have a phone to summon help. The Judge was entitled to find that he suffered in that time. You set about cleaning the flat in an attempt to hide what you had done. You disposed of evidence. You put another up to giving a false account for the deceased's injuries and left the scene. You have significant previous convictions. The offence was committed on licence. The Judge was entitled to find that you are a dangerous young woman and that these aggravating factors warranted an increase in the starting point of five years. In so doing he took into account the limited mitigation that you had. The Judge was well-placed to determine on the evidence whether you were the victim of domestic violence at the hands of the deceased and to conclude that you were not. He was entitled to find that you were the perpetrator of domestic violence at the hands of the deceased and to treat that as an aggravating factor. The Judge properly categorised the offence of unlawful wounding within the guideline. You were 16, nearly 17 years of age at the time of that offence. As was said in R v Ghafoor [2001] EWCA Crim 857 the starting point is the sentence a defendant would have been likely to have received if sentenced on at the date of the commission of the offence. Your youth would have been taken into account at that time. Eight years had passed between the commission of this offence and your sentence. As was said in Ghafoor a Judge is entitled to consider that a long interval between the commission of the offence and conviction as well as the fact that a defendant has been revealed to be a dangerous criminal by the time of sentence impacts on the appropriate reduction, if any for youth. In any event the sentence was ordered to run concurrently with the life sentence for murder which was only increased by three years for totality. The Judge plainly considered totality in the overall sentence imposed and expressly only increased the minimum term for the murder by three years for that reason. Your sentence is not arguably manifestly excessive for two extremely serious offences in which you stabbed partners or ex-partners multiple times. Leave to appeal sentence is accordingly refused."" We have reviewed the matter afresh and we have had regard to Ms Jones KC's careful submissions in developing the four grounds of appeal. However, we remain entirely in agreement with the single judge that there is nothing in this appeal. The principal point made by Ms Jones is that the judge was wrong to conclude that the applicant had not been a victim of domestic violence and that that finding was borne out of stereotypical assumptions as to the nature of the relationship between her and her partners. However, as the judge himself noted there was a ""preponderance of evidence"" pointing the other way and no positive case had been put forward by the applicant that she was a victim. The judge was well placed in our view, having presided over the trial, to make the judgment that he did. This is not a case where it can be said that the findings of fact made by the judge were inconsistent with other evidence, wholly uncontradicted by inconvertible facts or irrational in some sense. It is therefore not open to this court to go behind those findings made by the judge. Nothing in our review of the evidence or in Ms Jones' submissions undermines that conclusion. For those reasons, leave to appeal in this matter is refused.

The applicant is Elias Almallah (now aged 23). On 26 March 2024, following a trial in the Crown Court at Reading, he was convicted by a jury of a single count of murder. He was later sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 22 years and nine months. The Facts At around 8.45 pm on 2 October 2022, Kyron Lee (aged 21) was attacked by a group and killed. He was riding his bicycle on Earl's Lane, Slough, when it was struck by a stolen Volkswagen Golf car containing five occupants. Four of the occupants got out. Each was armed with a machete. Mr Lee ran off, but they chased him, caught up with him and attacked him. They attacked him a second time in Waterman Court. In the course of these attacks Mr Lee sustained multiple stab wounds from which he sustained blood loss which turned out to be fatal. The Golf arrived in Waterman Court. The attackers got into it and they were driven away. The car later came to a halt in Stour Close, where all the occupants got out and fled. Four went in one direction and one in another. The Trial By the time of the trial, three individuals, Yakoub Mussa, Khalid Nur and Mohammed Elgamri, had all been convicted of the murder. Mussa had pleaded guilty and the others had been convicted by the jury at a trial in June 2023. The prosecution case was that these were three of the four attackers. Their convictions were before the jury. So was that of another man, Mohammed Abdulle, who had not been present at the attack but had pleaded guilty in August 2023 to helping to plan and implement it. The applicant had left the jurisdiction after the murder and had remained away throughout the first trial. On his return he was arrested and charged. The prosecution case was that the applicant was the fourth attacker  the one who had headed away from the scene alone. That individual was said to be the tallest of the attackers and became known at the trial as ""the yellow man"". That was due to colour marking used by the prosecution to identify the various individuals shown on the CCTV. The applicant was tried with a single co-defendant, Fras Seedahmed, who was said to have been the driver, identified in the same way as ""the blue man"". The prosecution alleged that the applicant and Seedahmed had committed the murder as part of a joint enterprise with the others we have named to attack Mr Lee with the intention that he should be caused at least really serious harm. The main features of what took place were not in dispute. It was accepted that the occupants of the car were responsible for the death of Mr Lee. There were two issues for the jury in respect of the applicant. The first and main issue was identification: were they sure that he was ""the yellow man""? Secondly, if so, were they sure that he had the intention to kill or at least that really serious bodily harm should be caused? To prove its case, the prosecution advanced what was mainly a circumstantial case in reliance on multiple strands of evidence. The principal focus was CCTV evidence and cell site and phone analysis. The CCTV evidence was adduced via Casper De Wagt, a civilian police staff CCTV investigator; and cell site analysis was presented by two expert witnesses. In more detail, the evidence included the following: (1) Evidence of events and associations before the murder There was evidence that the participants, including the applicant, were part of one group of youths in the area, and that Mr Lee (the victim) was a member of another group. An events schedule was before the jury which was said to show tit-for-tat incidents over the period in the build-up to the attack, coupled with communications between the accused in connection with those incidents. Phone call data not only showed a wealth of contact between the applicant and his co-accused over many months, there was also evidence of continued phone contact and physical association between them in the weeks that preceded the murder. In particular, there was evidence of their connection with a small cul-de-sac car park in Ashmount Crescent where the stolen Volkswagen Golf was parked. The prosecution identified this as a ""pre-murder meeting point"". The car was identified as the ""mission car"". CCTV from this location showed a number of visits by the applicant. On 8 September the car, which had been stolen on the 4 th , was seen on CCTV in that car park. The applicant was then seen to leave the car park on foot in the company of Abdulle and Nur. Two days later the car and the same three individuals were observed again in the same location. Phone records from 1 October 2022 (the eve of the murder) and other evidence were said to demonstrate that three of the group, Elgamri, Nur and Abdulle, had arranged to meet up that evening at a chicken shop, from which they made calls to Mussa, Seedahmed and the applicant. Between 6.00 and 6.25 pm, Nur made repeated attempts to call the applicant before getting through. They then had a conversation for over a minute. Shortly after 7 pm, Abdulle, Elgamri and Nur were seen on CCTV to approach the car park on foot and, it was alleged, started to prepare the Golf for use in the attack. At around 7.30 pm, Nur called the applicant who called him back and they spoke for 20 seconds. A further call was made by Nur to the applicant at 7.50 pm, when the two spoke for 34 seconds. These and other calls between the co-accused were said by the prosecution to show ""a compelling pattern of calls to and from those about to engage in the attack"". At around 10 pm that night, the applicant was seen on CCTV at the Ashmount Crescent car park with Abdulle and Nur. They met up and were seen to shake hands before going their separate ways. The applicant accepted that he was correctly identified in this recording. (2) Comparison CCTV of ""the yellow man"", as he walked towards the car on the day of the murder, was said to show a person of the same build, height and manner of walking as the applicant. The jury were invited to compare this footage with clips which were admitted to be of the applicant and with still photographs of him posing with some of his co-accused. Mr De Wagt gave evidence that he had calculated that the applicant was the tallest of the accused. He based his opinion on measurements taken from immoveable objects such as poles or fences. (3) Evidence of events and associations after the murder There was CCTV of the Golf being abandoned in Stour Close. A figure was seen to open the boot and attempt to fix some cloned number plates to the car, before the various participants fled the scene in the way that we have described. The applicant's fingerprints were later found in the boot of the car. During the evening of 2 October, there were calls from Seedahmed, Abdulle and Nur to the other co-accused. These included calls to and conversations with the applicant which lasted over one minute and 30 seconds. On 3 October, the police issued a press release. The phone records showed frequent calls between the accused that morning. These included many calls between the applicant, Abdulle and Nur. At around lunchtime that day, there was a meeting between these three that became known as the ""Salthill Park meeting"". Within an hour of that meeting, the applicant and his brother had booked themselves on a one-way flight from Gatwick to Madrid, departing the following evening. Abdulle and Nur then booked one-way flights to Marrakech. Mussa was arrested at Heathrow, attempting to board a flight to Somalia. The others were said to have gone on the run. The prosecution invited the inference that the calls and the meeting represented discussions about the murder and the formulation and execution of a plan to flee the jurisdiction. The summary we have given is selective. It is illustrative of the evidence relied on by the prosecution, but it is far from being a comprehensive account. At the close of the prosecution case, counsel for the applicant submitted to the judge that there was no evidence of a sufficient quality for the jury, properly directed, to convict. There was insufficient evidence to establish that the applicant was ""the yellow man"". The judge ruled that there was a case to answer. He reminded himself of the test in the well-known case of Galbraith , and that it was not his job to usurp the functions of the jury. The judge concluded that there was a case fit for the jury to consider. He said that they would be directed to reject evidence of which they were unsure. The totality of the evidence needed to be considered, not just one specific item. So far as the quality of the evidence was concerned, the fact that there might be contradictions as to height did not render the totality of the evidence suspect or tenuous. Neither the applicant nor Seedahmed gave evidence. The judge proceeded to sum up the case to the jury. In doing so, he gave them legal directions on, among other things, the way they should approach the Crown's reliance on circumstantial evidence, their approach to the expert evidence, and how the silence of the defendants might or might not be relevant to their deliberations. The Proposed Appeal The applicant challenges the safety of his conviction on two grounds. First, he submits that the judge should have upheld the submission of no case to answer. Secondly, and in the alternative, he argues that the judge's summing up contained a misdirection about the absence of evidence to contradict the Crown's case. The renewed application has been argued before us today by Mr Almeida, who was the applicant's junior counsel at the trial. He has appeared pro bono . He has advanced the applicant's case with vigour and determination, and we are grateful for his assistance. However, he has not persuaded us that there is arguable merit in either of the proposed grounds of appeal. Ground 1: The Ruling that there was a Case to Answer The arguments advanced in support of this proposed ground of appeal are in essence those which the judge rejected. The headline submission focuses on alleged flaws in the quality of the circumstantial evidence relied upon. It is said that the prosecution evidence was so inherently weak or contradictory that there was nothing from which a reasonable jury could infer with certainty that the applicant was ""the yellow man"". In support of that submission, five main points were made in the written grounds: 1. The CCTV could not be a basis for identifying the applicant as ""the yellow man"". Mr De Wagt had conceded that it contained nothing identifying him as such. 2. Although the prosecution had obtained a mass of CCTV footage, there was not a single second that showed the applicant in or around any of the locations of interest on the day in question. 3. The evidence of Mr De Wagt that the applicant was the tallest of the suspects was not supported by scientific evidence, or any measurements, and was indeed contradicted by other evidence served by the prosecution which showed the other accused to be of similar or greater height. 4. The mobile phone evidence proved no more than innocent association. It was incapable of establishing the applicant's identity as ""the yellow man"" or even his presence at the scene at the material times. 5. Mere association with those convicted in the first trial was not capable of supporting any inference as to the applicant's identity as ""the yellow man"". It was submitted to us today that there was a high risk of conviction on the basis of mere association. Today, Mr Almeida has added a further point to do with a fingerprint found on the boot of the car. He has submitted that when viewed in its proper context this was a point of no real value from which no safe inference could be drawn. The single judge's assessment was this: "" the judge had the correct legal test in mind  he set out the relevant law  and, although the prosecution case against you was circumstantial, there was clearly evidence upon which a jury properly directed could convict on the basis that you were the man identified as 'the yellow man' on the CCTV footage. That included evidence of your height, build and manner, the pattern of your telephone calls, other evidence of association with your co-defendants who had been convicted of the murder (including being seen with them at the Ashmount Crescent Car Park on 10 September and 1 October 2022), and evidence of the events following the murder. That evidence was set out succinctly by the judge in his Ruling and, at greater length, in the Crown's Response to the Grounds of Appeal. You raise issues concerning various parts of that evidence; but as the judge said, these were submissions on the available evidence that were matters for the jury."" We find ourselves in agreement with that reasoning and would only add the following: 1. The foundation for the defence submission was, and remains, the quality of the prosecution evidence. It is a relatively rare case in which the court will find itself obliged to withdraw a case from the jury pursuant to that limb of the Galbraith test. It is normally proper to leave it to the jury to assess the quality and reliability of the evidence adduced. 2. In this case, although there was no direct evidence of identification of the applicant as ""the yellow man"", there was abundant evidence that connected him closely to several individuals who were known to have taken part in the murder and to the car that was used. 3. In a case where circumstantial evidence is relied on, the question at the halfway stage must always be whether the evidence as a whole is capable of justifying a verdict of guilty. It is commonplace that a conviction based on multiple strands of evidence may be safe, even if none of the strands is sufficient individually to support a conviction. 4. The critique advanced on behalf of the applicant focuses on alleged weaknesses in some of the strands of evidence relied on by the prosecution. Some of these weaknesses were conceded in the course of cross-examination. The critique, however, ignores, for instance, the evidence of the Salthill Park meeting and the way that the co-accused fled the country. 5. The applicant's critique also fails to confront the striking pattern of the phone calls and other associations which could in all the circumstances be reasonably considered to be highly incriminating. 6. The further submissions advanced today about the fingerprint in the boot of the car seem to us to be classic jury points, and nothing more. 7. Looking at the matter in the round, we see considerable force in the submission of the Crown that the evidence that the applicant was ""the yellow man"" was extremely strong. We are satisfied that the judge was not arguably wrong to dismiss the submission of no case to answer and to leave the case to the jury for their assessment. Ground 2: The Alleged Misdirection The written grounds of appeal submitted as follows: ""The learned judge was wrong to state, as part of his directions, that there was no evidence which contradicted the prosecution case. Throughout the prosecution evidence, there were ample challenges to evidence by the defence including the use of the prosecution's own documentary evidence against the live evidence of prosecution witnesses."" It was further submitted in the written grounds that the judge's directions to the jury ""effectively removed from the jury's mind the defence case that was put robustly to prosecution witnesses."" The grounds did not identify the passage (or passages) relied upon in support of this point. It was left to the court to scan the summing up to identify that material. The single judge evidently thought, as did we on reading the papers, that the passage complained of was one that used the word ""contradict""  or some variant of it. There are two passages in the summing up that mention the absence of contradictory evidence. The first was contained in the judge's direction about the applicant's silence at trial, where the judge said this: ""The silence of the [applicant] is relevant to your consideration for the following reasons: First, the issue for you is whether the [applicant] is guilty based on the evidence adduced by the Crown. Secondly, there is no evidence before you from Fras Seedahmed or Elias Almallah which contradicts, undermines or explains the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of the case that each is guilty."" This direction was in standard form and entirely accurate. Neither defendant had gone into the witness box to give evidence to contradict, or to undermine, or to explain the evidence which the prosecution had called. Nor, for good measure, had either of them adduced any other defence evidence. The applicant's counsel are correct to say that they had challenged the prosecution evidence and that to that end they had drawn on the prosecution's own documentary evidence. The judge's legal direction was not at odds with that. Nor can the jury have thought that it was. The jury heard the evidence and the cross-examination over many days. In a careful summing up of the evidence, the judge reminded them in some detail of the defence case and the way that it had been put to the prosecution witnesses, including, but not limited to, the experts. Multiple illustrations of this point could be given. But in the light of what we have said about ground one, it is appropriate to mention one aspect in particular. The judge summed up the evidence of Mr De Wagt. He reminded the jury that he was not put forward as an expert or as an identifying witness. He identified the defence case, namely that this witness' evidence was ""of little, if any, assistance as regards the identification"". The judge gave details of the defence challenge. He said this: ""The garments and footwear are commercially mass-produced items. They are readily available in the market and items which many young people wear. Indeed, the one item produced before you was purchased by the prosecution and there is evidence that another young man was wearing a similar jacket. There is nothing unique, say the defence, about any one item that you have been referred to."" The judge went on to give a direction about Mr De Wagt's evidence as to height. He identified the defence case that Mr De Wagt's evidence was not supported, but contradicted by the documentary evidence, and he identified the chart on which the defence relied. The second reference in the summing up to the absence of contradiction came at the very end of the judge's summary of the evidence. He concluded by emphasising that the account he had given was only a summary and that the jury were not constrained to considering matters that he had mentioned, by advising them to keep in mind all the evidence and the submissions of counsel and by reminding them of the burden and standard of proof. Having done that, the judge said this: ""The defendants are entitled to make the prosecution prove its case against him and that is what they have done."" He went on, according to the transcript, to use these words: ""But, of course, there is no evidence which has been adduced by the prosecution which in any way contradicts or explains the evidence relied on by the prosecution from the defendant."" On the page, this sentence looks garbled. The sense of it is, however, perfectly clear. It is no more than a repetition of the point that the judge had properly and clearly made in his legal directions. Those legal directions had been reduced to writing and they were taken away by the jury into retirement. There is, therefore, no reasonable basis for supposing that the jury may have been confused or misled by this passage. In the light of these considerations, our conclusion had been that the short answer to this proposed ground of appeal was that the judge never made any statement of the kind complained of, and that it was fanciful to suggest that the judge had effectively removed the defence case from the jury's consideration. This morning, it has emerged that the intended submission was a different one, with reliance being placed on a passage in the summing up relating to the expert evidence. On page 21 of the transcript, the judge said this: ""This is, ladies and gentlemen, a trial by jury and not a trial by experts. While you may accept or reject expert opinion evidence, you must not substitute your own opinions for those of the expert. It is a matter for you but you may reject the evidence of an expert even where, as in this case, it is largely unchallenged, but you may feel you need good reason to do so. Where there is a challenge then you must resolve that in the normal way and you decide whether the evidence is reliable or not."" Complaint has been made by Mr Almeida about the words ""largely unchallenged"". They are said to give the impression to the jury that there had been no substantial challenge to the expert evidence, namely the cell site analysis of Mr Robinson, when in fact there had been a substantial and sustained challenge. With respect to counsel, we have been unable to see any reasonable objection to the language chosen by the judge. We note that no objection was raised at the time. Nor, as we have observed, was this a point identified in the proposed grounds of appeal. We mention these points not by way of criticism, but as further indications that support our conclusion that this proposed ground of appeal lacks any substance. Having considered this point in the context of the summing up as a whole the position, as it seems to us, is that the judge gave correct directions as to the approach to be taken to the expert evidence and then summarised the evidence and the challenges to it in an entirely fair manner. In our judgment, this proposed ground of appeal is entirely without merit. Accordingly, and for these reasons, the renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction is refused. __________________________________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2025/433.html","Almallah, R. v [2025] EWCA Crim 433 (28 March 2025) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 433 Case No 2024/01523/B4 ON APPEAL FROM THE CROWN COURT AT READING (HIS HONOUR JUDGE NAWAZ) [T20237031] B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE WARBY MR JUSTICE GOOSE HIS HONOUR JUDGE PATRICK FIELD KC (Sitting as a Judge of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division) ____________________ REX - v - ELIAS ALMALLAH ____________________ of Abdulle and Nur. Two days later the car and the same three individuals were observed again in the same location. Phone records from 1 October 2022 (the eve of the murder) and other evidence were said to demonstrate that three of the group, Elgamri, Nur and Abdulle, had arranged to meet up that evening at a chicken shop, from which they made calls to Mussa, Seedahmed and the applicant. Between 6.00 and 6.25 pm, Nur made repeated attempts to call the applicant before getting through. They then had a conversation for over a minute. Shortly after 7 pm, Abdulle, Elgamri and Nur were seen on CCTV to approach the car park on foot and, it was alleged, started to prepare the Golf for use in the attack. At around 7.30 pm, Nur called the applicant who called him back and they spoke for 20 seconds. A further call was made by Nur to the applicant at 7.50 pm, when the two spoke for 34 seconds. These and other calls between the co-accused were said by the prosecution to show ""a compelling pattern of calls to and from those about to engage in the attack"". At around 10 pm that night, the applicant was seen on CCTV at the Ashmount Crescent car park with Abdulle and Nur. They met up and were seen to shake hands before going their separate ways. The applicant accepted that he was correctly identified in this recording. (2) Comparison CCTV of ""the yellow man"", as he walked towards the car on the day of the murder, was said to show a person of the same build, height and manner of walking as the applicant. The jury were invited to compare this footage with clips which were admitted to be of the applicant and with still photographs of him posing with some of his co-accused. Mr De Wagt gave evidence that he had calculated that the applicant was the tallest of the accused. He based his opinion on measurements taken from immoveable objects such as poles or fences. (3) Evidence of events and associations after the murder There was CCTV of the Golf being abandoned in Stour Close. A figure was seen to open the boot and attempt to fix some cloned number plates to the car, before the various participants fled the scene in the way that we have described. The applicant's fingerprints were later found in the boot of the car. During the evening of 2 October, there were calls from Seedahmed, Abdulle and Nur to the other co-accused. These included calls to and conversations with the applicant which lasted over one minute and 30 seconds. On 3 October, the police issued a press release. The phone records showed frequent calls between the accused that morning. These included many calls between the applicant, Abdulle and Nur. At around lunchtime that day, there was a meeting between these three that became known as the ""Salthill Park meeting"". Within an hour of that meeting, the applicant and his brother had booked themselves on a one-way flight from Gatwick to Madrid, departing the following evening. Abdulle and Nur then booked one-way flights to Marrakech. Mussa was arrested at Heathrow, attempting to board a flight to Somalia. The others were said to have gone on the run. The prosecution invited the inference that the calls and the meeting represented discussions about the murder and the formulation and execution of a plan to flee the jurisdiction. The summary we have given is selective. It is illustrative of the evidence relied on by the prosecution, but it is far from being a comprehensive account. At the close of the prosecution case, counsel for the applicant submitted to the judge that there was no evidence of a sufficient quality for the jury, properly directed, to convict. There was insufficient evidence to establish that the applicant was ""the yellow man"". The judge ruled that there was a case to answer. He reminded himself of the test in the well-known case of Galbraith , and that it was not his job to usurp the functions of the jury. The judge concluded that there was a case fit for the jury to consider. He said that they would be directed to reject evidence of which they were unsure. The totality of the evidence needed to be considered, not just one specific item. So far as the quality of the evidence was concerned, the fact that there might be contradictions as to height did not render the totality of the evidence suspect or tenuous. Neither the applicant nor Seedahmed gave evidence. The judge proceeded to sum up the case to the jury. In doing so, he gave them legal directions on, among other things, the way they should approach the Crown's reliance on circumstantial evidence, their approach to the expert evidence, and how the silence of the defendants might or might not be relevant to their deliberations. The Proposed Appeal The applicant challenges the safety of his conviction on two grounds. First, he submits that the judge should have upheld the submission of no case to answer. Secondly, and in the alternative, he argues that the judge's summing up contained a misdirection about the absence of evidence to contradict the Crown's case. The renewed application has been argued before us today by Mr Almeida, who was the applicant's junior counsel at the trial. He has appeared pro bono . He has advanced the applicant's case with vigour and determination, and we are grateful for his assistance.

On 15 May 2018 he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years, less the days spent remanded in custody. He appeals against that sentence by leave of the single judge. The appellant and Kirby (as we too shall call her) had known each other since childhood. They lived together for a number of years. The appellant was a user of drugs of all kinds. Kirby was besotted with him. She had a son by another man and a second child by the appellant. Under his influence, she abandoned them both to move to the southwest with him. She later gave birth to another child of whom he was the father. That child too was taken from her. She followed him wherever he went and did whatever he asked her to do. She became largely estranged from her own family. She described the appellant as the love of her life. He on the other hand spoke of her in dismissive and disrespectful terms. Having travelled for some years, homeless and sleeping rough, Kirby managed to secure for the couple a small, damp basement flat. The appellant's evidence at trial was that between them they received about £1,500 per month in benefits with their rent paid. Virtually all of the benefit money was spent on drugs. Kirby was last seen alive on 10 January 2017. By 14 January the appellant was using her bank card in unsuccessful attempts to draw cash, which were thwarted by his not knowing the PIN. In the intervening days he had murdered Kirby in their flat. It was a dreadful murder, the circumstances of which we will summarise without dwelling on distressing details. It was not discovered for some four months. During that period the appellant was able to use Kirby's debit card to make some purchases from the funds which were credited to her bank account by the social services. He arranged for his own benefits to be paid into an account in his name rather than, as previously, an account in her name, telling social services that his girlfriend and he had split up. In mid-May 2017 the appellant began to send Facebook messages to relatives in which he said that there had been a body on the floor in their flat and he had chopped the body up and put it in bins and down the toilet. He said that either he had killed Kirby or Kirby and a man called 'Dan' were setting him up. He said he had last seen Kirby in the wheelie bin. He sent photographs of the blood splattered on the walls and ceiling of their bedroom. In his messages he went on to make bizarre references to imagined events in his past. The police were contacted and an officer went to the flat. The appellant told him that he had killed Kirby and got rid of her in the wheelie bin. He showed the officer the blood in the bedroom. He said that he must have killed her and that he wanted help because he could not get it out of his head. He also said that he had made a necklace from Kirby's teeth. He was arrested. The scene was of course investigated. As no body was found it was necessary for DNA samples to be taken from Kirby's parents and son, which enabled the scientists to establish that it was her blood in the bedroom of the flat. There was blood spatter on the walls caused by impacts into wet blood. On the ceiling there were blood patterns consistent with the swinging of a heavily bloodstained weapon. A section of the carpet had been removed. Blood staining on the concrete surface below had largely been cleaned away. There was also blood spatter on a wall caused by impact into wet blood in a separate incident. The mattress had heavy blood staining on the underside and marks indicating that Kirby had been moved across it. The bed frame was also bloodstained, from which it could be inferred that the mattress had been turned whilst the blood was still wet. A heavily bloodstained rock was on the floor at the end of the bed and pieces of rock were in the bedroom and living room. These pieces could be fitted together and the pattern of blood staining indicated that they had broken in the course of the attack. There was a metal pole found with screws projecting from it. The appellant's evidence was that that had usually been kept by the front door in case someone aggressive came. On it was found Kirby's blood. There were hair swipes on the pole indicating that it had made contact with hair wet with blood. The appellant's palm print was on the pole. Police also found two rucksacks in the flat which had Kirby's blood inside. They appeared to have played some part in the removal of parts of her body from the flat. The general distribution of blood in the flat suggested that the appellant had attacked Kirby with a rock which fractured into pieces with the force of his blows. He had also used the metal pole on her with blows which must have been directed at her head. She may have been lying on the bed when he attacked her. She was bleeding heavily whilst on the bed and the lines of blood on the ceiling above were probably projected from the blood-soaked weapon with which the appellant was striking her. She ended up on the floor beside the bed where further blows were delivered. Having killed her, it seems the appellant removed her body, probably in pieces, and cleaned up the worst of the blood. Between mid-January and mid-May the appellant and his two dogs continued to live in the flat, which was in the state we have described. In a series of interviews the appellant gave an account that he had had an argument with Kirby and after that there was a body on the floor which he had removed in pieces. He surrounded that account with a series of lies in which he said he had been set up by Kirby and a man called Dan Entwhistle. He said that Kirby was still alive; she had not only cheated him but had sent men to rape him. The police conducted extensive enquiries. There was no trace of Kirby being alive after mid-January and there was no trace of any Dan Entwhistle. At trial the appellant maintained this lying account. Following his conviction, there was before the court a moving victim personal statement from Kirby's mother which we have read and which we have well in mind. In her sentencing remarks the learned judge said that she was sure that the appellant had first attacked Kirby by hitting her with the rock. When it broke, he went upstairs to the bathroom to get the metal pole which he kept there. He used that to finish her off on the floor. It was not known, said the judge, whether this was one continuous attack or whether the appellant might have attacked her on one day before finishing her off on another. Whether it was the work of minutes, hours or even days, and for how long she had been conscious with the appellant raining blows upon her, the appellant had not said and there was no body to reveal the extent of the attack upon her. Whatever the time frame, said the judge, this was a pitiless attack on someone who had done nothing but love the appellant devotedly. The appellant's lies, said the judge, demonstrated the opposite of remorse. He had never expressed any regret at all for what he had done. The only possible piece of mitigation was that the attack did not seem to have been premeditated. Although the trial had been adjourned to allow for psychiatric reports to be prepared, no reports were relied upon either at trial or at sentencing. The judge concluded that the appellant was not ill when he killed Kirby and that the drugs which he was taking could not have accounted for any part of his extreme violence. The judge was satisfied that when the appellant fetched the metal pole and bludgeoned Kirby's head with it, he must have intended to kill her. When Kirby was dead the appellant had just left the corpse where she lay. He must have eaten, slept and taken his drugs next to it for several days. Over a weekend before the bin men came on the Monday, the appellant cut up what remained, wrapped some in the carpet and took the rest in rucksacks to the bins. From there the bin men collected them and the waste was taken to the local incinerator. As the judge put it, in this bleak and desolate manner was Kirby's life ended and her remains obliterated. Not only had the appellant deprived her and her family of a life, he had also taken from them the dignity of commemorating her death. The judge recorded that the victim personal statement spoke of Kirby's mother's loss of hope, the grief of being unable to bury her daughter and the torment experienced by herself, Kirby's step father and her son then aged 11. The judge then referred to the provisions of schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which, as is well-known, sets four starting points for the minimum term in cases of murder committed by an adult. By paragraph 4, if the court considers that the seriousness of the offence or the combination of the offence and one or more associated offences is exceptionally high, the appropriate starting point for an offender aged 21 or over is a whole life order. Examples are given of the type of case which would fall into that category. By paragraph 5, if the court considers that the seriousness of the offence is particularly high, the starting point for an offender aged over 18 is 30 years. Again, examples are given of cases falling into that category. By paragraph 5A, a minimum term with a starting point of 25 years is appropriate where the offender has taken a knife or other weapon to the scene, intending to commit any offence or have it available to use as a weapon and use the knife or other weapon in committing the murder. By paragraph 6, in cases which do not fall within any of the preceding paragraphs the starting point is one of 15 years. Reflecting on the application of those provisions, the judge said that the pole used by the appellant had been in the flat albeit up some stairs and she thought it was debatable whether that could be regarded as a case of taking a weapon to the scene. Similarly, although the use of Kirby's bank account by the appellant after her death approached the seriousness of a murder done for gain, the judge said she could not be sure that that was the reason why the appellant had killed her. His actions in breaking a large rock over Kirby's head and then collecting and using a metal pole with protruding screws to beat her further came close to but fell just short of qualifying as sadistic behaviour as referred to in the schedule. The judge concluded that the specific factors set out in paragraph 5(2) of the schedule did not apply, but that the paragraph did not provide a complete list of all the circumstances in which a 30-year starting point would be appropriate. She concluded that the combination of aggravating features in this case rendered the seriousness of the offence particularly high. Those features were that Kirby had loved and trusted the appellant; she had been in her own bedroom when without any apparent provocation he had attacked her; it was a vicious prolonged assault during which the appellant meant to kill her; having broken a large rock over her head he went upstairs to fetch a metal pole with which to finish her off; after killing her in this remorseless way he had cold-bloodedly lived next to her corpse with his dogs in the room for several days, before cutting up her remains and disposing of them in the bins. The judge acknowledged that what happened afterwards could not make the death itself more serious, but it was a very serious aggravating factor. The judge referred to the appellant's previous convictions, none of which were for particularly serious offences, and indicated that she would disregard them in deciding the minimum term. She was sure that notwithstanding his habitual drug use the appellant was entirely sentient when he murdered Kirby. Thus she came to the minimum term of 28 years from which were to be deducted 361 days spent on remand in custody. In written and oral submissions, presented with admirable focus, Miss Martin submits that the judge was in error in taking a starting point of 30 years. She acknowledges the seriousness of the case and the very distressing features to which we have referred, but submits that the seriousness was not ""particularly high"" so as to bring it within paragraph 5 of schedule 21 and so to attract the 30-year starting point. She accordingly submits that the judge should have taken a starting point of 15 years. The judge was entitled to treat as aggravating features the prolonged nature of the attack and the steps subsequently taken to dismember and dispose of the body. Counsel accepts that the latter feature is a particularly serious aggravating feature because of the additional grief which it causes to the bereaved: see Attorney General's References Nos 108 and 109 of 2005 [2006] EWCA Crim. 513. Nonetheless, Miss Martin submits the judge having taken the wrong starting point passed a sentence which went beyond what was commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. For the respondent, Mr Dunkels QC in his written and oral submissions emphasises, as indeed is accepted on behalf of the appellant, that paragraph 5(2) of the schedule provides examples of cases which will attract a 30-year starting point but does not constitute a conclusive list of all such cases. He submits that the facts justified the judge's finding that the seriousness of the offence was ""particularly high."" We note however that in a helpful sentencing note submitted to the judge, the respondent had submitted that the starting point was 15 years, unless the judge found that the metal pole had been taken to the scene in circumstances bringing the case within paragraph 5A of the schedule. This was on any view a serious case. We do however accept the submission on behalf of the appellant that it was not a case in which the seriousness was ""particularly high"" for the purposes of schedule 21. With every respect to the judge, the case is in our view more appropriately viewed as one in which the starting point was 15 years, but that a number of grave aggravating features increased that starting point very substantially. The important issue in our view is not the starting point taken by the judge, but rather the finishing point of her sentence. In that regard, the following features are important. First, the savage manner in which Kirby was murdered is in itself a gravely aggravating feature. The judge was correct to conclude that on the evidence it could not be said that the metal pole which was at the top of a short flight of stairs was ""taken to the scene"" so as to come within paragraph 5A: see Dillon [2015] EWCA Crim 3 . On the evidence, the rock had not been taken to the scene within the meaning of that paragraph either. The circumstances were however that the appellant first attacked Kirby with the rock using such force as to break the rock. It can safely be inferred that that initial attack incapacitated her and rendered her defenceless to what followed. The appellant then fetched his second weapon, a particularly vicious one, with screws protruding from the pole, and with that he beat Kirby to death. The blood distribution which we have summarised told its own story of the violence used. As the judge observed, there was no way of knowing over what period of time that was done. The structure of schedule 21 presupposes an intent to kill. That much is apparent from the indication in paragraph 11 of a specific mitigating factor, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm rather than to kill. The starting point was therefore not to be increased because of the intent to kill which the judge clearly correctly found proved. But it certainly was to be increased, and substantially so, by the manner in which the deceased was murdered in her own home by the man to whom she had devoted herself and to whom she was entitled to look for love and protection. Next, we regard the conduct of the appellant after the murder in taking prompt financial advantage of what he had done was a second serious aggravating feature. The judge correctly concluded that it was not a case of murder for gain, but it was a case of almost immediate use of the deceased's bank card - unsuccessfully in one respect, but successfully in others. We are not able to accept the submission on behalf of the appellant that this was at most a neutral feature. A third and in our view particularly grave aggravating feature was the appellant's treatment of Kirby's body after her death. The circumstances scarcely bear thinking about. For a period of time he and his dogs lived with the body in the flat. He then somehow cut up the body of the woman who had been devoted to him and disposed of the pieces in ways which meant that all trace of her would soon be obliterated. Thus the appellant compounded the indignity with which he had treated her body by dishonouring her memory. Every murder not only ends one life, but also harms and often damages irreparably many others. In the present case, the appellant in the months after murdering the deceased could hardly have done more to increase the anguish of Kirby's family. To set against that, the judge rightly found that the only possible mitigation was the lack of premeditation, but that could carry very little weight given that the murderous assault must inevitably have continued over at least some time. It is beyond argument that the combination of these features justified a very substantial increase from the 15-year starting point which we have found to be appropriate. The person best placed to assess the proper extent of that increase was the trial judge, who had heard all of the evidence. Her conclusion that the appropriate minimum term was 28 years was a severe sentence and high in the range properly open to her. We are not however persuaded that it was manifestly excessive. For those reasons, this appeal is dismissed. Epiq Europe Ltd hereby certify that the above is an accurate and complete record of the proceedings or part thereof.

On 15 May 2018 he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years, less the days spent remanded in custody. He appeals against that sentence by leave of the single judge. The appellant and Kirby (as we too shall call her) had known each other since childhood. They lived together for a number of years. The appellant was a user of drugs of all kinds. Kirby was besotted with him. She had a son by another man and a second child by the appellant. Under his influence, she abandoned them both to move to the southwest with him. She later gave birth to another child of whom he was the father. That child too was taken from her. She followed him wherever he went and did whatever he asked her to do. She became largely estranged from her own family. She described the appellant as the love of her life. He on the other hand spoke of her in dismissive and disrespectful terms. Having travelled for some years, homeless and sleeping rough, Kirby managed to secure for the couple a small, damp basement flat. The appellant's evidence at trial was that between them they received about £1,500 per month in benefits with their rent paid. Virtually all of the benefit money was spent on drugs. Kirby was last seen alive on 10 January 2017. By 14 January the appellant was using her bank card in unsuccessful attempts to draw cash, which were thwarted by his not knowing the PIN. In the intervening days he had murdered Kirby in their flat. It was a dreadful murder, the circumstances of which we will summarise without dwelling on distressing details. It was not discovered for some four months. During that period the appellant was able to use Kirby's debit card to make some purchases from the funds which were credited to her bank account by the social services. He arranged for his own benefits to be paid into an account in his name rather than, as previously, an account in her name, telling social services that his girlfriend and he had split up. In mid-May 2017 the appellant began to send Facebook messages to relatives in which he said that there had been a body on the floor in their flat and he had chopped the body up and put it in bins and down the toilet. He said that either he had killed Kirby or Kirby and a man called 'Dan' were setting him up. He said he had last seen Kirby in the wheelie bin. He sent photographs of the blood splattered on the walls and ceiling of their bedroom. In his messages he went on to make bizarre references to imagined events in his past. The police were contacted and an officer went to the flat. The appellant told him that he had killed Kirby and got rid of her in the wheelie bin. He showed the officer the blood in the bedroom. He said that he must have killed her and that he wanted help because he could not get it out of his head. He also said that he had made a necklace from Kirby's teeth. He was arrested. The scene was of course investigated. As no body was found it was necessary for DNA samples to be taken from Kirby's parents and son, which enabled the scientists to establish that it was her blood in the bedroom of the flat. There was blood spatter on the walls caused by impacts into wet blood. On the ceiling there were blood patterns consistent with the swinging of a heavily bloodstained weapon. A section of the carpet had been removed. Blood staining on the concrete surface below had largely been cleaned away. There was also blood spatter on a wall caused by impact into wet blood in a separate incident. The mattress had heavy blood staining on the underside and marks indicating that Kirby had been moved across it. The bed frame was also bloodstained, from which it could be inferred that the mattress had been turned whilst the blood was still wet. A heavily bloodstained rock was on the floor at the end of the bed and pieces of rock were in the bedroom and living room. These pieces could be fitted together and the pattern of blood staining indicated that they had broken in the course of the attack. There was a metal pole found with screws projecting from it. The appellant's evidence was that that had usually been kept by the front door in case someone aggressive came. On it was found Kirby's blood. There were hair swipes on the pole indicating that it had made contact with hair wet with blood. The appellant's palm print was on the pole. Police also found two rucksacks in the flat which had Kirby's blood inside. They appeared to have played some part in the removal of parts of her body from the flat. The general distribution of blood in the flat suggested that the appellant had attacked Kirby with a rock which fractured into pieces with the force of his blows. He had also used the metal pole on her with blows which must have been directed at her head. She may have been lying on the bed when he attacked her. She was bleeding heavily whilst on the bed and the lines of blood on the ceiling above were probably projected from the blood-soaked weapon with which the appellant was striking her. She ended up on the floor beside the bed where further blows were delivered. Having killed her, it seems the appellant removed her body, probably in pieces, and cleaned up the worst of the blood. Between mid-January and mid-May the appellant and his two dogs continued to live in the flat, which was in the state we have described. In a series of interviews the appellant gave an account that he had had an argument with Kirby and after that there was a body on the floor which he had removed in pieces. He surrounded that account with a series of lies in which he said he had been set up by Kirby and a man called Dan Entwhistle. He said that Kirby was still alive; she had not only cheated him but had sent men to rape him. The police conducted extensive enquiries. There was no trace of Kirby being alive after mid-January and there was no trace of any Dan Entwhistle. At trial the appellant maintained this lying account. Following his conviction, there was before the court a moving victim personal statement from Kirby's mother which we have read and which we have well in mind.

B e f o r e : MR. JUSTICE EDMUND DAVIES MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL and MR. JUSTICE WIDGERY ____________________ R E G I N A -v- CYRIL DAVID CHURCH ____________________ MR. A.E. JAMES,Q.C. and MR. D.C, SMOUT appeared as Counsel forthe Appellant. MR. W.A. SIME,Q.C. and MR. H.J. BERRY appeared as Counsel for the Crown ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © MR. JUSTICE EDMUND DAVIES : In July last at Nottingham Assizesm the appellant, having been indicted for and acquitted of the murder of Sylvia Jeannette Nott, was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced by Mr. Justice Glyn-Jones to 15 years' imprisonment. He now appeals to this Court on a point of law against that conviction, and he also applies for leave to appeal against sentence. The facts may be shortly stated. On Sunday, May 31st, 1964, the dead body of Mrs. Nott was found in the River Ouse within a few yards of the defendant's van which stood near the bank. The corpse bore the marks of grave injuries. The face had been battered, the hyoid bone had been broken and there had been some degree of manual strangulation. These injuries were likely to have caused unconsciousness and eventually death, but they were inflicted a half-hour or an hour before death supervened and did not in fact cause it. According to the medical evidence her injuries were inflicted not long before Mrs. Nott was thrown into the river, but she was alive when that was done, she continued to breathe for an appreciable time afterwards, and the eventual cause of death was drowning. When the accused was first interviewed about the matter he lied, but ultimately signed a statement admitting complicity in the death. He then said that he had taken Mrs. Nott to his van for sexual purposes, that he was unable to satisfy her and she then reproached him and slapped his face; they then had a fight during which he knocked her out and thereafter she only moaned. The statement continued: ""I was shaking her to wake her for about half and hour, but she didn't wake up, so I panicked and dragged her out of the van and put her in the river"". He repeated this account at his trial and then said, and said for the first time, ""I thought she was dead"". The outline of the case for the prosecution, therefore, was this: The gravity of the injuries inflicted during life clearly pointed to an intention by the accused to cause grievous bodily harm to or the death of Mrs. Nott. Her death was in fact brought about by the action of the accused in shortly thereafter throwing her still-living body into the river. Did it make any difference, as far as the murder charge was concerned, whether or not the accused believed she was then already dead? On this question the learned trial Judge gave at page 26 CD this direction : ""His case is that he genuinely and honestly believed that she was dead. I direct you that, if that his genuine and honest belief, then when he threw what he believed to be a dead body into the river, he obviously was not actuated by any intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm; you cannot cause death or serious bodily harm to a corpse. Therefore the question for you is: Have the prosecution satisfied you that his story told before you today ... that he believed she was dead, is untrue: and that the truth is that he threw her into the river not caring whether she was alive or dead but simply to get her out of his van, so that he would not be caught and punished for what he had already done to her?"" The Jury were thus told in plain terms that they could not convict of murder unless it had been proved that the accused knew that Mrs. Nott was still alive when he threw her into the river or (at least) that he did not then believe she was dead. We venture to express the view that such a direction was unduly benevolent to the accused and that the Jury should have been told that it was still open to them to convict of murder, notwithstanding that the accused may have thought his blows and attempt at strangulation had actually produced death when he threw the body in the river, if they regarded the accused's behaviour from the moment he first struck her to the moment when he threw her into the river as a series of acts designed to cause death or grievous bodily harm. See Thabo Meli v. Regina . 1954, 1 All England Reports at page 373. In the present case the Jury, directed as they were, acquitted of murder. They had, however, been told that the trial Judge could see no ground upon which the accused could be acquitted of all crime and they convicted of manslaughter. Against that conviction the accused now appeals on the ground that there was a basic misdirection when the Jury were told (as they were) that, as to the offence of manslaughter, it was irrelevant whether the accused genuinely and honestly believed the body to be dead at the time of immersion. Against the background of the basic direction regarding the nature of the Crown's burden of proof as to murder, it seems to this Court that at least three possible bases of the manslaughter verdict call for consideration:- (a) Criminal Negligence. A grosser case of criminal negligence it would be difficult to imagine. As the trial Judge put it at page 28 at B to C:- ""What steps did he take to find out whether she was alive or dead? He seems to have made no attempt, according to him, to find out whether she was breathing or not. He seems to have made no attempt to feel whether her heart was beating. Surely these are elementary steps. You have then nothing left but his bare unsupported statement: 'I thought she was dead'. All he had done had been to shake her and she had not recovered consciousness. Do you think that persuaded him that she was dead, or do you not?"" That passage was directed to the charge of murder. As to manslaughter, the following direction was given at page 31D to F:- ""..If, not knowing whether the woman was dead or not, and not having taken the trouble to find out whether she was dead or not, he throws her body into the river, you may (if you think fit) come to the conclusion that that was a negligent act done utterly recklessly without regard to the danger to life or limb that would be caused by it - and that would be another ground on which the throwing of the body into the river would be manslaughter"". That direction has been strongly criticised as wholly inadequate in relation to criminal negligence as expounded in Bateman , 1925, 19 Criminal Appeal Reports, page 8, and Andrews v. The Director of Public Prosecutions , 1937, 26 Criminal Appeal Reports, page 34. But the nature of the direction called for must depend on the facts of each case. In the judgment of this Court, the facts in the present case were such as to render an elaborate direction unnecessary. Utter recklessness was the standard which the Jury were told had to be applied, and the evidence amply justified a verdict that it had been established. (b) Provocation. There is no room for doubt that the plea of provocation had but a flimsy basis and wholly justified the adverse summing-up on this issue. The injuries inflicted on the deceased in the van were so grave, those sustained by the accused in the alleged fight so trifling, that the question raised by the trial Judge at page 26 C: ""Do you think that that degree of reaction bears any reasonable proportion to the alleged provocation, or do you not?"" permitted of only one answer from a reasonable Jury. But the matter does not stop there, because, as the Jury were told at page 25 C to D: "".. it seems to me impossible to say (and defence counsel concedes this) that the provocation could have extended beyond the infliction of the injuries in the van; it cannot possibly extend to the final act of throwing the body into the river"". Inexplicable though a Jury's verdict may be and improper though it generally is to embark on enquiry as to its rationale ( Rex v. Larkin , 1942, 29 Criminal Appeal Reports, page 18),this Court is forced to the conclusion that the verdict returned was not based upon provocation reducing what would otherwise have been a murderous act to one of manslaughter. (c) An unlawful act causing death. Two passages in the summing-up are here material. They are these; (1) at page 30H: ""If by an unlawful act of violence done deliberately to the person of another, that other is killed, the killing is manslaughter even though the accused never intended either death or grievous bodily harm. If this woman was alive, as she was, when he threw her in the river, what he did was a deliberate act of throwing a living body into the river. That is an unlawful killing and it does not matter whether he believed she was dead or not, and that is my direction to you"", and (2) at page 33A: ""I would suggest to you, though it is of course for you to approach your task as you think fit, that a convenient way of approaching it would be to say: What do we think about this defence that he honestly believed the woman to be dead? If you think that it is true, why then as I have told you, your proper verdict would be one of manslaughter, not murder"". Such a direction is not lacking in authority; see for example Shoukatallie v. The Queen (1962 Appeal Cases, page 81 in Lord Denning's opinion at pages 86 and 92) and Dr.Glanville Williams' Criminal Law, 2nd Edition at page 173. Nevertheless, in the judgment of this Court it was a misdirection. It amounted to telling the Jury that, whenever any unlawful act is committed in relation to a human being which resulted in death there must be, at least, a conviction for manslaughter. This might at one time have been regarded as good law - see, for example, Fenton 's case (1830 1 Lewin, page 179). But it appears to this Court that the passage of years has achieved a transformation in this branch of the law and, even in relation to manslaughter, a degree of mens rea has become recognised as essential. To define it is a difficult task, and in Andrews v. The Director of Public Prosecutions (1937, 26 Criminal Appeal Reports page 34) Lord Atkin (at page 45) spoke of ""the element of 'unlawfulness' which is the elusive factor"". Stressing that we are here leaving entirely out of account those ingredients of homicide which might justify a verdict of manslaughter on the grounds of (a) criminal negligence, or (b) provocation or (c) diminished responsibility, the conclusion of this Court is that an unlawful act causing the death of another cannot, simply because it is an unlawful act, render a manslaughter verdict inevitable. For such a verdict inexorably to follow, the unlawful act must be such as all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm. See, for example, Regina v. Franklin (1883, 15 Cox Criminal Cases, page 163), Regina v. Senior (1899, 1 Queen's Bench, page 283), Rex v. Larkin (29 Criminal Appeal Reports page 18,in Mr. Justice Humphreys' Judgment at page 22), Regina v. Buck & Buck (1960, 44 Criminal Appeal Reports page 213 at page 218) and Regina v. Hall (1961, 45 Criminal Appeal Reports, page 366 at pages 370 and 373). If such be the test, as we adjudge it to be, then it follows that in our view it was a misdirection to tell the Jury simpliciter that it mattered nothing for manslaughter whether or not the accused believed Mrs. Nott to be dead when he threw her in the river. But, quite apart from our decision that the direction on criminal negligence was an adequate one in the circumstances, such a misdirection does not, in our judgment, involve that the conviction for manslaughter must or should be quashed. In the light of Thabo Meli it is conceded on behalf of the appellant that, on the murder charge, the trial Judge was perfectly entitled to direct the Jury, as he did at page 24 C to D that: ""Unless you find that something happened in the course of this evening between the infliction of the injuries and the decision to throw the body into the water, you may undoubtedly treat the whole course of conduct of the accused as one"". But for some reason not clear to this Court, appellant's Counsel denies that such an approach is possible when one is considering a charge of manslaughter. We fail to see why. We adopt as sound Dr. Glanville Williams' view in the book already quoted from at page 174 that, ""If a killing by the first act would have been manslaughter, a later destruction of the supposed corpse should also be manslaughter"". Had Mrs. Nott died of her initial injuries a manslaughter verdict might quite conceivably have been returned on the basis that the accused inflicted them under the influence of provocation or that the Jury were not convinced that they were inflicted with murderous intent. All that was lacking in the direction given in this case was that, when the Judge turned to consider manslaughter, he did not again tell the Jury that they were entitled (if they thought fit) to regard the conduct of the accused in relation to Mrs. Nott as constituting throughout a series of acts which culminated in her death, and that, if that was how they regarded the accused's behaviour, it mattered not whether he believed her to be alive or dead when he threw her in the river. Having regard to the summing-up as a whole, the difference between what was said to the Jury and that which, in the opinion of this Court, should have been said is so minimal that we consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice resulted. On the whole of the facts and upon such a direction as we have indicated, we are satisfied that the proper and inevitable verdict would have been one of guilty. It cannot conceivably be said, in our judgment, that the misdirection referred to deprived this appellant of a chance of total acquittal on the indictment which was fairly open to him. We accordingly regard this as a proper case to apply the proviso to Section 4(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, and, having done so, dismiss the appeal against conviction. As to sentence, the trial Judge said: ""I think this is the worst case of manslaughter I have ever heard of"". It was unquestionably a terrible case, and young though the accused was (being merely 21 at the time of the crime) and minor though his previous convictions were, this Court cannot say that the sentence of 15 years, while undoubtedly severe, was wrong in principle. We have been urged to hold that, as it appears to have been said in another place that a life sentence involves incarceration of up to 10 years, it was wrong in principle that this accused, convicted of manslaughter, should be called upon to remain in prison at least as long as, and possibly longer, than he would have been had the Jury convicted him of murder. That consideration this Court cannot have regard to. As this Court said in Regina v. Singh on 23rd February 1965, but unreported, ""... the Court has in mind that 'life sentence' means a sentence for life, and that any remission as a result of which a prisoner is released is a matter entirely for the Home Secretary"". The application for leave to appeal against sentence is accordingly also dismissed, MR. JAMES: My Lords, in respect of the appeal against conviction would your Lordships certify that a point of law of general public importance is involved; the point that I have in mind is this, that in respect of death by criminal negligence, what is the duty of care owed by an accused person in dealing with that which is believed to be inanimate? MR. JUSTICE EDMUND DAVIES: I have not consulted my Brethren yet, Mr. James, but I should have thought off-hand that the basic fallacy in the reasoning of that question is: supposed to be inanimate. That presupposes that the belief that one was dealing with an inanimate object was a reasonable belief which was not arrived at by criminal negligence. MR. JAMES: It must be the subjective test, and judged in the light of the reasonable objective basis. MR. JUSTICE EDMUND DAVIES: In relation to the death. MR. JAMES: By criminal negligence. What is the duty of care owed by an accused person in dealing with that which he believes to be inanimate? ( Their Lordships conferred ) MR. JUSTICE EDMUND DAVIES: Thank you, Mr. James, but your application is refused, the Court being unable to certify.

D.C, SMOUT appeared as Counsel forthe Appellant. MR. W.A. SIME,Q.C. and MR. H.J. BERRY appeared as Counsel for the Crown ____________________ ____________________ MR. JUSTICE EDMUND DAVIES : In July last at Nottingham Assizesm the appellant, having been indicted for and acquitted of the murder of Sylvia Jeannette Nott, was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced by Mr. Justice Glyn-Jones to 15 years' imprisonment. He now appeals to this Court on a point of law against that conviction, and he also applies for leave to appeal against sentence. The facts may be shortly stated. On Sunday, May 31st, 1964, the dead body of Mrs. Nott was found in the River Ouse within a few yards of the defendant's van which stood near the bank. The corpse bore the marks of grave injuries. The face had been battered, the hyoid bone had been broken and there had been some degree of manual strangulation. These injuries were likely to have caused unconsciousness and eventually death, but they were inflicted a half-hour or an hour before death supervened and did not in fact cause it. According to the medical evidence her injuries were inflicted not long before Mrs. Nott was thrown into the river, but she was alive when that was done, she continued to breathe for an appreciable time afterwards, and the eventual cause of death was drowning. When the accused was first interviewed about the matter he lied, but ultimately signed a statement admitting complicity in the death. He then said that he had taken Mrs. Nott to his van for sexual purposes, that he was unable to satisfy her and she then reproached him and slapped his face; they then had a fight during which he knocked her out and thereafter she only moaned. The statement continued: ""I was shaking her to wake her for about half and hour, but she didn't wake up, so I panicked and dragged her out of the van and put her in the river"". He repeated this account at his trial and then said, and said for the first time, ""I thought she was dead"". The outline of the case for the prosecution, therefore, was this: The gravity of the injuries inflicted during life clearly pointed to an intention by the accused to cause grievous bodily harm to or the death of Mrs. Nott. Her death was in fact brought about by the action of the accused in shortly thereafter throwing her still-living body into the river. Did it make any difference, as far as the murder charge was concerned, whether or not the accused believed she was then already dead? On this question the learned trial Judge gave at page 26 CD this direction : ""His case is that he genuinely and honestly believed that she was dead. I direct you that, if that his genuine and honest belief, then when he threw what he believed to be a dead body into the river, he obviously was not actuated by any intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm; you cannot cause death or serious bodily harm to a corpse. Therefore the question for you is: Have the prosecution satisfied you that his story told before you today ... that he believed she was dead, is untrue: and that the truth is that he threw her into the river not caring whether she was alive or dead but simply to get her out of his van, so that he would not be caught and punished for what he had already done to her?"" The Jury were thus told in plain terms that they could not convict of murder unless it had been proved that the accused knew that Mrs. Nott was still alive when he threw her into the river or (at least) that he did not then believe she was dead. We venture to express the view that such a direction was unduly benevolent to the accused and that the Jury should have been told that it was still open to them to convict of murder, notwithstanding that the accused may have thought his blows and attempt at strangulation had actually produced death when he threw the body in the river, if they regarded the accused's behaviour from the moment he first struck her to the moment when he threw her into the river as a series of acts designed to cause death or grievous bodily harm.

The Crown were not represented. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © LORD JUSTICE EDIS: This is a renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction following refusal by the single judge. The application has been renewed before us on the papers only, and in that regard we have received a letter from the applicant, Tina Walton, which we have taken into account. The applicant was convicted of murder on 24 February 2023 in the Crown Court at Preston before Mr Justice Linden and a jury. She had been on trial together with others who were accused of murdering the deceased together. The fatal blow was struck by Stephen Pugh but the others, including this applicant, were said to have pursued the deceased, and to have attacked him together. The role of this applicant was that she was accused of having assisted and encouraged the others in a joint attack on the deceased, Mark Gibson. The case was advanced by the prosecution on the basis of some eye-witness evidence, evidence from witnesses who had heard things happening and being said and also, very significantly, on the basis of CCTV footage which showed a good deal of what had taken place although not absolutely everything. It was clear that the group, including Pugh and this applicant, had confronted Mr Gibson in the street in Blackpool over a short period of time and had pursued him in order to do that. Pugh, who had the knife which inflicted the fatal wound, was not the only one who had a weapon. It was not alleged that this applicant herself had a weapon but it was alleged that the CCTV footage showed her enthusiastically accompanying the group which inflicted a variety of different physical attacks on Mr Gibson, culminating, as we have said, in his death. The grounds of appeal state, first, that there was confusion about when the deceased was murdered. It was alleged that the applicant had blocked his exit when he was murdered whereas, in fact, he had been assaulted whilst the applicant was on the floor, herself having been assaulted. She was concussed and had a head injury and was incapable of blocking any exit. It is, indeed, true that the spur which caused the group to behave in the way it had was an altercation between the applicant and Mr Gibson in which she may well have suffered some concussion because it appears clear that she did, indeed, have a head injury. This was shortly before the pursuit of Mr Gibson in the street and was the provoking fact but was separate from the series of violent acts which resulted in his death. We shall return to this ground in a moment. We should refer to two further grounds before we do. Secondly, the applicant disputes that she encouraged anyone to do anything following the assault on her by the deceased. She could not see any weapons, she did not have a weapon and did not assault anyone. Thirdly, she says that the prosecution paused the CCTV footage at a point where there was an expression on her face which she described as a grimace which, she says, was out of context. This originated when the prosecution had said that she was in a rage. Her case was that she was in pain from the multiple injuries which she had suffered. These three grounds, as we have called them, in fact, are pleaded in the grounds of appeal as grounds 1, 2, 3 and 6. What they have in common is that they all express disagreement with the conclusion of the jury about the jury's findings on the evidence which the jury had received. These points which the applicant seeks to make before this court were made on her behalf and in her evidence before the jury. They were dealt with by the judge in summing up the case to the jury and the jury were well aware that they had to decide whether these points had force and, if so, whether they required them to return a not guilty verdict to murder. The place where points of this sort have to be determined is the trial. This court does not engage in substituting its own views of factual matters for that of the jury. For that reason, these points, having been properly dealt with in the trial in Preston, raise no arguable ground of appeal against the conviction. This leaves two matters which we should deal with separately. The first of these relates to the service on the jury of a female juror who, at the start of the process when the jury were being impanelled, sent a note to the judge saying that she worked as a practice nurse at a general practitioner's practice in Blackpool but she did not know the names of anybody involved in the case and did not recognise anyone in the dock. The judge concluded that this did not present an obstacle to her serving on the jury. That conclusion was not only a conclusion that was open to him, it was quite obviously the right conclusion. The juror was behaving responsibly in making the judge aware of the fact that she worked in the relevant area in Blackpool and also of the fact that she had no reason not to be a juror. The applicant points to no particular prejudice or disadvantage which she can say flowed to her from the presence of this woman on the jury, and there is no reason at all to suspect or believe that this juror was in any way affected by anything that she was aware of through her work in this practice as opposed to the evidence and argument which she had heard during the trial. In those circumstances it is not arguable that the presence of this woman on the jury gives rise to any lack of safety in the conviction which the jury returned. Finally, the applicant makes a complaint about her legal team. That has resulted in the waiver of privilege and in her leading counsel supplying information to the court about how the criticised aspects of her representation were dealt with. The principal complaint that she makes is that she was not offered the opportunity to plead guilty to manslaughter. Leading counsel says that there was some discussion about manslaughter but the position is that the prosecution never suggested that if she pleaded guilty to manslaughter that it would not proceed to trial for murder. Her case, as advanced in evidence on oath from the witness box, was that she had done nothing wrong and that she had herself been the victim of an assault by the deceased. She said that she did not recall events clearly but gave evidence that she did not know that anybody was armed with weapons or had chased the deceased with violent intent. Accordingly, there was no basis on which she could admit guilt for manslaughter and offer that plea. As we have said, in any event, even if she had decided to do that, that offer would certainly have been rejected. In those circumstances, how the possible alternative of manslaughter was dealt with in pre-trial discussions between her and her legal team is entirely irrelevant when considering the safety of the conviction for murder. In those circumstances this ground also affords no arguable basis on which the conviction could be said to be unsafe. And for all of those reasons this application is refused on its merits. There has been some delay in its prosecution by the applicant, but if we had found any merit in the grounds of appeal which were advanced we would not have allowed that to stand in the way of the appeal. Since there is no merit, leave is refused. __________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2025/875.html","Walton, R. v [2025] EWCA Crim 875 (06 February 2025) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 875 No. 202304261 B5 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE EDIS MR JUSTICE SOOLE HIS HONOUR JUDGE FORSTER KC ____________________ REX - v - TINA WALTON ____________________ Computer-aided Transcript of Epiq Europe Ltd Lower Ground, 46 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1JE Tel no 020 7404 1400, Email rcj@epiqglobal.co.uk ( to the Court) ____________________ The Applicant was not represented, did not attend.

The application has been renewed before us on the papers only, and in that regard we have received a letter from the applicant, Tina Walton, which we have taken into account. The applicant was convicted of murder on 24 February 2023 in the Crown Court at Preston before Mr Justice Linden and a jury. She had been on trial together with others who were accused of murdering the deceased together. The fatal blow was struck by Stephen Pugh but the others, including this applicant, were said to have pursued the deceased, and to have attacked him together. The role of this applicant was that she was accused of having assisted and encouraged the others in a joint attack on the deceased, Mark Gibson. The case was advanced by the prosecution on the basis of some eye-witness evidence, evidence from witnesses who had heard things happening and being said and also, very significantly, on the basis of CCTV footage which showed a good deal of what had taken place although not absolutely everything. It was clear that the group, including Pugh and this applicant, had confronted Mr Gibson in the street in Blackpool over a short period of time and had pursued him in order to do that. Pugh, who had the knife which inflicted the fatal wound, was not the only one who had a weapon. It was not alleged that this applicant herself had a weapon but it was alleged that the CCTV footage showed her enthusiastically accompanying the group which inflicted a variety of different physical attacks on Mr Gibson, culminating, as we have said, in his death. The grounds of appeal state, first, that there was confusion about when the deceased was murdered. It was alleged that the applicant had blocked his exit when he was murdered whereas, in fact, he had been assaulted whilst the applicant was on the floor, herself having been assaulted. She was concussed and had a head injury and was incapable of blocking any exit. It is, indeed, true that the spur which caused the group to behave in the way it had was an altercation between the applicant and Mr Gibson in which she may well have suffered some concussion because it appears clear that she did, indeed, have a head injury.

On 8 th December 1999 in the Crown Court at Lewes before Potts J and a jury, the Appellant Rattigan and the Applicant Wyatt were each convicted unanimously of murder, and on the same date were sentenced to life imprisonment. On 27 th November 2000 we dismissed Rattigan's appeal against conviction by leave of the single judge, and the (non-counsel) application for leave to appeal against conviction of Wyatt, following refusal by the single judge. We stated that we would give our reasons later and do so now. 2. On the morning of 17 th December 1998, the body of 88-year-old Mrs Hilda Tizzard (""the victim"") was found at her flat in a block of sheltered housing called The Poynings. Her hands and feet were tied, she had suffered numerous injuries during the night. The cause of death was compression of her neck with a ligature formed from a T-shirt tied round her neck. Rattigan and Wyatt both admitted having burgled the victim's flat the previous night, and the cause of death was not in dispute. Each denied murder, blaming the other. The prosecution put the case against both on the basis of joint enterprise. The issue for the jury was whether either or both of the accused had the necessary intent and were responsible for the victim's death. THE EVIDENCE 3. The evidence for the prosecution was as follows: The two accused had been released from Chichester Police Station on the afternoon of 16 th December 1998 having been held overnight on suspicion of theft. They spent the evening of 16 th December 1998 drinking at a public house in Bognor Regis with two female friends called Sonia and Jamey. They left at about 10.30 to 11 p.m. and returned to Sonia's flat in Bognor Regis where there was an argument between Rattigan and Wyatt. Jamey said that Wyatt was winding Rattigan up. Rattigan attacked him and Wyatt ended up lying on the floor. His head was cut. Both men left the flat at about 11.45 p.m. ostensibly to go to Chichester Hospital. Later Jamey and Sonia went to the hospital to pick them up, but they were not there. The women returned to their flat in Bognor at about 1.30 a.m. to find the two men outside the flat. They said that they had not been to the hospital but had gone to Worthing instead. After an expedition to buy some cigarettes, Rattigan and Sonia went to bed together and Wyatt stayed in the same room as Jamey. In cross-examination she described an occasion the month before when Rattigan and Wyatt had brought two stolen mountain bikes to the flat. She also agreed that she had on occasion offered to act as ""look-out"" when Rattigan was burgling. There was also an occasion earlier that month when stolen items were brought back to the flat. 4. At 1.41 a.m. on the night of 16 th /17 th December, the police received a 999 call, reporting a burglary at The Poynings. The caller said he was from Brighton and gave his name as ""Elkins"". He said he had seen two men running from the building in the direction of the railway station and had heard someone shouting behind them. The caller said he was calling from Lewes. Subsequently a police officer heard the tape of the call and identified the voice as being that of Rattigan (as was not disputed). 5. Mr Smith, the manager of Poynings said that the victim was physically fit, although profoundly deaf and sometimes confused. He had the care of her pension book as she sometimes mislaid things, and on Wednesday 16 th December had given her £33.90 which he saw her put into a small plastic wallet with her credit cards. [That wallet was later recovered from nearby where Rattigan had thrown it]. On the morning of 17 th December at about 9.30 a.m. he entered the victim's flat with her care worker and found her body on the floor, and he called the ambulance and the police. Mr White, a paramedic who arrived soon after, checked the victim's pulse with difficulty because of the material tied tightly around her neck. Her hands were tied together so tightly that the ligature was cutting into the skin. The same ligature ran to her feet which were also tied together. The Scenes of Crimes Officer moved the victim's body finding underneath it two pieces of leather strap, four pieces of string and two pieces of cloth. He noticed two paper envelopes on the floor and found shoe marks on the grass at the rear of the building. A forensic expert gave evidence that footprints outside the window and also upon the two envelopes found within the flat corresponded to shoes belonging to Rattigan and Wyatt which were later obtained by the police. 6. Dr Borek, the prosecution pathologist who examined the victim's body said that the T-shirt ligature tied around her neck was flush with the skin but not cutting into it. The complex set of bindings from shoelaces secured her left wrist and right thumb to her ankles. Her hands were tied in front of her body, the ligature around the right thumb being very tight and deeply indented the skin. Scattered petechiae (pin-point haemorrhages) were present in and around the left eye and over the neck, all consistent with pressure from the ligature around the neck, as was congestion found in the scalp lower face and earlobes. There were 18 minor abrasions to the face, head and neck including an area of injury to the upper lip and scratch under the skin, which might have been caused as the victim struggled. There were 21 bruises and abrasions on the right arm and 15 on the left, including marks made by the ligatures. There were further abrasions and bruises to the legs and back of the trunk. Bruising around the nostrils and chin led Dr Borek to conclude that there had been a blow to the mouth splitting the upper lip and bruising the tongue. There was deep bruising to the muscles of the neck and its deeper tissues consistent with significant pressure which, in Dr Borek's view was far greater than would have been caused by the ligature in the condition that she found it after death. It would have had to have been tighter at an earlier stage. There were six areas of injury to the trunk, the most significant of which was a fracture to the sternum of a type which would have been caused by a blow or firm pressure. Further bruising to the chest wall and corresponding bruising to the back indicated a similar cause, such as would come from a person kneeling upon the victim's chest. Dr Boric concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia following compression of the neck with a broad ligature, the facial injuries suggesting an attempt to smother associated with a struggle. The appearance of petechiae in the eyelids suggested that the pressure on the neck must have been sustained for a minimum of 15 to 30 seconds. 7. The evidence of the Defendants was as follows. 8. Rattigan accepted that he had several previous convictions for offences against the person and property, including robbery, and for dishonesty. He said that having served a sentence for causing grievous bodily harm he had attempted to change his lifestyle, meeting and forming a friendship with Wyatt in April 1998. They had embarked together on a health course at Chichester College where they met Sonia and Jamey who were students on the same course. All four became friends. In November 1998 he had started stealing again. He said that following his release from custody with Wyatt on the afternoon of 16 th December they went to a flat in Canada Grove and in the evening went out drinking. They returned to the flat about 10.20 p.m. and where he and Wyatt had an argument and he hit Wyatt who did not retaliate. They left the flat to go to hospital, but Wyatt said he did not need to go, so they walked around for a while and decided to commit a burglary. Rattigan stole a Metro car and they drove around eventually coming to the block of flats at The Poynings. Having discovered an open window at the rear of the building, he looked through the window and saw the light was on in a room which appeared to be empty. He pulled the window open and climbed through it, Wyatt following. He began to search the bureau and Wyatt went towards the front door to begin searching there. He said he would not have entered the flat had he known that someone was there. Having searched the bureau he went to the bedroom area and found a handbag in the wardrobe. He took a wallet which he found in the handbag. At that point he heard a door open. He said he turned to Wyatt who was at the other side of the room and said ""come on"", jumping out of the window immediately without seeing anyone come in. He returned straight to the car and did not look back to see if Wyatt was following. He said he did not find the victim's pension money. He only looked through her wallet after leaving the flat, having stolen it in the hope that it contained money. 9. Rattigan said that, having left the flat, he sat in the car for 20 to 25 minutes waiting for Terry Wyatt in the belief he could not find the car. Wyatt returned to the car and Rattigan said ""what kept you?"", but Wyatt did not reply. Nor did he say anything of what had happened on the journey back to Sonia's flat. Rattigan drove to the back of some flats near Canada Grove, parked the car and left it there. He said that it was only as they were walking towards Canada Grove that Wyatt told him that an old lady had come into the flat, that he had panicked and tied her up. Rattigan said that he told Wyatt that he was going to phone the police and did so, despite Wyatt's attempts to persuade him not to. Rattigan said that he had no idea that the victim was dead or dying; he simply wanted the police to untie her. He said that the name ""Elkins"" was the first that came into his head. He said that they had not told Sonia and Jamey anything. He said that he did not find out that the victim had died until Wyatt told him so on the evening of Friday 18 December, having heard it on the radio. They did not discuss what they would say if they were arrested. On Monday 21 December he was arrested and interviewed, being re-interviewed several times on 22, 23 and 24 December before being charged with murder on 24 December. He made no comment at any of the interviews. He said that that was because he was distressed and afraid and did not want to be seen as a ""grass"". 10. Wyatt, giving evidence, confirmed his meeting and friendship with Rattigan. He said he was aware of Rattigan's criminal past and had seen him inject heroin on one occasion. He knew that Rattigan was carrying out burglaries and that he had become involved in drug dealing by the end of September 1998. He said that at the end of November he had stolen two mountain bikes with Rattigan and they had also carried out a burglary together when he (Wyatt) was drunk. He confirmed his and Rattigan's movements and the incident at the flat at Canada Grove. He said that, Rattigan having offered to take him to hospital, they left the flat together heading towards the railway station in order to go to Chichester Hospital by train. However, Rattigan told him they were not going to hospital but to do a burglary. Wyatt said he refused, but Rattigan held a screwdriver to his stomach and threatened to stab him if he did not go with him. Wyatt said he was petrified and agreed to act as look-out. He said that Rattigan broke into the Metro and told him to get in. They arrived at the building which he now realised was The Poynings. Rattigan announced they would do a burglary there and, following another argument, Wyatt agreed to stay outside the back as look-out. When Rattigan found the window was open, Wyatt gave him a leg-up in order to get in, but remained outside himself. He then heard Rattigan's voice telling him to come inside and he jumped in. He saw that Rattigan had someone on the floor and was holding one hand over the person's mouth and the other around the collar area, with his knee on the person's chest. Rattigan told him to hold on to the person whom he realised at that point was a woman. He put his hand over her mouth while Rattigan ransacked the flat. Rattigan then told Wyatt to take his hand off her mouth and asked the woman repeatedly where her money was. She said at first it was in the teapot and then began to shout for help. At this Rattigan lost his temper and punched her three times in the chest. Wyatt said he tried to intervene. He said that it had not crossed his mind that Rattigan might beat her up or kill her. They then heard a noise and Rattigan said that they had to tie her up to prevent her raising the alarm. He said that Rattigan tried unsuccessfully to tie her hands with a cloth and then told Wyatt to do it. Wyatt said he pulled the laces out of two pairs of shoes and he and Rattigan both tied her up. Rattigan pulled a cloth tightly round her mouth in order to gag her. He said that he (Wyatt) had had to tie her thumbs tightly because she was flapping her hands while he was tying the knot. 11. Wyatt said that he then headed towards the window and heard the woman gurgling. He looked back and saw that Rattigan was pulling the gag tighter; he warned him he was choking her and loosened the gag. The woman appeared to have fainted and Rattigan appeared to begin an attempt at artificial respiration. Wyatt said he knelt beside her and checked that she had a pulse and was breathing. He scooped the contents of her handbag which Rattigan had given him back into the bag and left through the window. He looked back to see Rattigan throwing cushions and bedding over the victim before he left. Rattigan snatched the bag from him and threw it over the hedge (where it was found later by the police). Wyatt said he looked through the window to check that the victim was all right and saw her move. It was his immediate wish to telephone the police, but Rattigan told him there was no need to do so because he had pulled the alarm as they were leaving. 12. In cross-examination Wyatt suggested that the victim must be been strangled between the time he had checked her pulse and gone to the window. He said that Rattigan remained aggressive as they returned to the car and made their way to the bottom of Canada Grove where they dumped the car near the flats. He said that he (Wyatt) went to the phone box in order to call the police, but Rattigan snatched the phone from him and, after an abortive attempt to report the matter to the Samaritans, they telephoned 999. On Friday evening he heard that the victim was dead; his reaction was disbelief. He told Rattigan the news and was told to keep quiet. When Rattigan was arrested on 21 st December, Wyatt attended the police station and made a witness statement in which he gave a lengthy explanation as to his and Rattigan's movements over the period, much of which was untrue. In particular, it did not reveal the participation of either of them in the burglary and killing. He said that he had lied because he was afraid of Rattigan and also being charged with murder himself. Not long after giving his witness statement he was arrested on 21 December and interviewed in the presence of his solicitor on 22 and 23 December. At those interviews he made no comment and was charged with murder on 24 December. Questioned about his physical involvement in the attack on the victim, he said that he had put his hand over her mouth, on Rattigan's instructions to stop her calling out. While he did so she was humming hymns and not struggling. When Rattigan asked her ""where's your fucking money"", she mentioned a teapot. He said he could not explain why he had not called an ambulance afterwards, but repeated that he had been afraid. The Application of Wyatt 13. At trial an application was made on behalf of Wyatt to exclude the evidence of his witness statement, made on 21 December 1998 for his arrest. The defence submitted it was clear that Wyatt was by that time suspected of participating in the killing of the victim and that therefore he should have been cautioned (which he was not) prior to being interviewed and making a statement. The Judge held a voir dire, hearing evidence from the police officers supervising the case, Detective Chief Inspector (by then Detective Superintendent) Ladley and Sergeant Dixon; also from Detective Sergeant Buttle who interviewed Wyatt and took the statement. 14. When rejecting the application, the Judge stated that he considered the evidence of Ladley and Buttle was of crucial importance. It was clear from the contemporaneous notes made by Ladley, and from his evidence, that Wyatt was regarded and noted as a ""significant witness"" rather than a suspect (the description accorded to Rattigan) at the time he made his statement. The Judge said that the officers had no reason to consider Wyatt a suspect from an earlier visit to Canada Grove, when they were simply trying to find the whereabouts of Rattigan and spoke briefly to Wyatt. Rattigan was arrested at 5 p.m. on 21 December and Wyatt, who was with him at the time, accompanied the police to the police station. Wyatt was then taken to Chichester so that his interview could be recorded on video; the Judge said that he accepted Superintendent Ladley's evidence that it was normal practice to record interviews with significant witnesses on video. He also accepted Ladley's assurance that, prior to interview, he was not aware that Wyatt had a criminal record and he had no grounds to believe that Wyatt had been involved with Rattigan in the murder. It was only when Ladley obtained Wyatt's account from the officers who conducted the interview and became aware that he claimed to have been at the flat in Canada Grove at the relevant time, contrary to the account the police had earlier received from Jamey, that Wyatt became a suspect, and he was arrested at 11.30 p.m. that night. The Judge also concluded that Buttle, who had interviewed Wyatt for several hours, had no reason to treat him as anything other than a witness. 15. Having seen extracts from the video of Wyatt's interview, the Judge accepted Buttle's account that the purpose of the interview was to find out the movements of Rattigan over the relevant period and that, had Wyatt made any admissions or appeared to implicate himself in any way, Buttle would have proceeded to caution him. The Judge found that at no stage was any such admission made and that Wyatt did not achieve the status of a suspect prior to comparison of his statement with the information received from Jamey. 16. The principle ground of Wyatt's application for leave to appeal is that the Judge wrongly allowed the admission of the witness statement taken from Wyatt for the purposes of cross-examination by both the co-defendant and the prosecution as to the lies which were told in it. It is said that the admission of the statement, which was referred to in closing speeches and the summing-up, undermined Wyatt's credibility and substantially prejudiced his case. 17. It may well be the fact that lies were told in that statement and that Wyatt sought to distance himself and Rattigan from the scene of the crime did undermine Wyatt's credibility. However, the police were not obliged to caution Wyatt if they reasonably regarded him only as a witness and not as a suspect as the judge found, nor are we persuaded that there are any grounds for interfering with the findings of the judge or the exercise of his discretion. 18. The grounds of appeal against conviction settled by Counsel on behalf of Wyatt which failed to persuade the single judge to grant leave, were supported by an advice in which those grounds were elaborated. That advice asserts that the police had grounds to suspect Wyatt because he was an associate of Rattigan's, living with him at Canada Grove and known to have been released from Chichester Police Station earlier that day. He was also with Rattigan at the time of his arrest. However, it is also acknowledged that the second man suspected of participation in the crime with Rattigan was a man called Lovegrove, also known as an associate of Rattigan and living near Canada Grove. It is said that, on that basis, and the content of the video interview, at which DC Buttle told Wyatt that he was being questioned with regard to his (not Rattigan's) movements at the time of the murder, indicate that the Judge was wrong in the view which he took and the ruling which he made. We do not accept that argument. The Judge gave lengthy and careful consideration to the arguments raised on Wyatt's behalf at the time of the application and was in the best position to make a judgment whether, at what was a very early stage of the police investigations, they had reached the point when the police ought reasonably to have regarded and treated Wyatt as a suspect. We see no good basis on which to interfere with the decision of the Judge in that respect. 19. The second point taken in the grounds of appeal settled by Counsel is that, at one point in the summing-up, the Judge referred to Wyatt accepting in evidence that he had put his hand over the victim's mouth and nose , when in fact he only admitted covering her mouth. We do not have a transcript of the evidence of Wyatt. The Judge was plainly quoting from his notebook in the passage complained of, which reads as follows in the transcript of the summing-up: ""I put my hand over her mouth because I was told to do it. It was like a nightmare. I had my hand over her mouth, on her nose, to stop her shouting; and one under her chin. She was humming hymns; she was trying to calm me down. I didn't think to take my hand off her mouth. She was not struggling. It was then she was asked by Rattigan: `Where's your fucking money?' and mentioned a teapot."" 20. If, as Counsel suggests in his advice, that note was erroneous, we do not think that, on its own, the mistake amounts to a ground of appeal. It is stated in counsel's advice that the point was not sought to be made a subject of correction before the jury, because to have done so would only have highlighted a part of the evidence against Wyatt, which, even on his own story, showed his participation in the violence and restraint applied to the victim. In any event, the remark that Wyatt's hand was on her nose does not in itself indicate that he was obstructing her breathing at the time and his evidence was plain that he took his hand away in order that she could answer Rattigan's questioning. Accordingly we do not think there would be any prospect of establishing that the verdict was unsafe upon the ground asserted. 21. In further grounds of his own composition, Wyatt complains under six heads which are additional to those already settled by counsel and which are supported by an ""Advice"" also in Wyatt's own hand, elaborating on those grounds. We have read both documents carefully and, for the reasons briefly indicated below, find that they afford no arguable grounds of appeal. 22. First it is complained that the judge erred in ruling inadmissible under s.78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act a cell confession allegedly made by Rattigan to a witness/fellow prisoner called Sims. The judge cannot be faulted for his decision in this respect in relation to evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution. If, for the purposes of Wyatt's defence, direct evidence of the confession was required, that was a matter for Wyatt's solicitors. 23. Second, it is complained that the judge allowed the prosecution to adduce evidence from Jamey which supported Rattigan's defence, while directing the jury to disregard it in relation to Wyatt. It is not made clear to which aspect of the evidence this complaint refers, but there is no reason to suppose that the judge was in error in this respect. 24. Third, it is complained that Wyatt's advisors failed to follow up allegations that he had been unlawfully detained in December 1998 prior to the taking of the witness statement to which we have referred and fourth, that the defence negligently delayed in instructing a pathologist on behalf of Wyatt so as to be able to contest the findings of the police pathologist. Neither of these deficiencies can afford a ground of appeal and we note that in relation to the fourth complaint no tangible disadvantage to the defence of Wyatt is identified. 25. Fifth, there is a further complaint of negligence on the part of the defence in failing to investigate Wyatt's claim that it was he who made a telephone call to the Samaritans, before Rattigan took over and phoned the police. In that respect it is said he was disadvantaged in that Rattigan was enabled to appear to be the party actively concerned for the victim's welfare, rather than Wyatt. While it may be that in this respect Wyatt was placed at a disadvantage, it cannot afford any ground for an appeal. 26. Finally, it is complained that counsel gave inaccurate and detrimental advice in first advising that Wyatt should exercise his right to silence in interview with the police and subsequently in advising that Wyatt's statement should deal with the details of the earlier burglary or burglaries. Again, such a complaint cannot now afford a ground of appeal. 27. In those circumstances, we dismiss Wyatt's application. The Appeal of Rattigan 28. The Judge's summing-up to the jury on Tuesday 8 th December 1999 was a long and careful one which lasted all day. On the preceding Friday and Monday, the Judge had discussed and eventually agreed with Counsel before they addressed the jury a list of written questions to be placed before the jury as an aid to their deliberations and which the Judge incorporated and elaborated in his summing-up. This was plainly an advisable course because of the complications arising from the conflicting accounts of the Defendants in relation to the Crown's case of joint enterprise and the ""cut throat"" defences conducted. 29. Despite the agreement upon the list of questions, the broad ground of appeal in this case is that they did not provide an appropriate framework for the consideration of Rattigan's case, if factually accepted by the jury, and that the summing-up was an inadequate supplement so far as the Judge's legal directions in relation to `joint enterprise' and `withdrawal' from joint enterprise were concerned. In that respect the criticisms centre upon passages in the summing-up which extend over some four pages of transcript from which is it necessary to quote in some detail. 30. Having referred to the uncontested conclusion of the pathologist that the victim had died in consequence of the violence done to her, which neither Defendant had suggested was accidental or justified, the Judge gave the following oral directions (as to which, for convenience of reference, I have numbered the paragraphs quoted): ""1. It follows from that, that whoever you find is responsible for inflicting the violence, or was party to that violence, is - if you make those findings - at the least, guilty of manslaughter. And I did not understand, in the addresses of either Counsel for the Defence, any suggestion to the contrary ... 2. The Prosecution's case is that these defendants committed the offence of murder together. Where a criminal offence committed by two or more persons, each of them may play a different part; but if they are in it together, as part of a joint plan or agreement to commit the offence then they are each guilty ... 3. The words ""plan"" and ""agreement"" do not mean there has got to be any formality about it: an agreement to commit an offence may arise in advance, for example to go to a house and burgle and use violence on the householder if necessary. Or it may arise on the spur of the moment to do violence to the householder who disturbs the burglars. Nothing need be said at all; it can be made good with a nod or a wink, a knowing look; an agreement can be inferred from the behaviour of the parties. The essence of joint responsibility for a criminal offence is that each defendant shared the intention to commit the offence and took part in it, however great or small, so as to achieve that aim. 4. So your approach to this case should be as follows: If, looking at the case of either defendant, you are sure that with the requisite intent for murder - and I am going to use that expression from time to time, that means with intent to kill, or attempt to do really serious bodily harm - he committed the offence on his own, or that he took some part in committing it with his co-defendant, he is guilty. But bear in mind that mere presence at the scene of the crime is not enough to prove guilt; there must be participation in the offence. 5. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is common ground here .. that there was a joint plan to commit a burglary. Not disputed. But if, on your findings, one defendant, in using violence on Mrs Tizzard, went beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do, this defendant alone is responsible for the act and is therefore guilty of murder, if he had the requisite intention for murder, or, if otherwise, of manslaughter. 6. But if you are sure that the co-defendant realised that the other might use violence in furtherance of the burglary the law is that, by taking part in the burglary with that knowledge, he accepted the risk that his co-defendant could act in that way, he adopted his co-defendant's acts and is responsible for them. 7. In respect of each defendant remember this: if you are sure that that defendant joined in a joint plan or agreement with his co-defendant to do violence in the furtherance of burglary to Mrs Tizzard if necessary, the Crown must make you sure that he did not withdraw from the plan before the fatal blows were struck; that is, that he had not a change of mind and had made it clear to his co-defendant, by words or actions, his intention of withdrawing from the plan, that is in the sense of disassociating himself from the plan, and not merely escaping, before the defendant had time to act as he did."" 31. The Judge proceeded shortly thereafter to take the jury through the agreed form of questions which were as follows: ""You should ask yourself these questions in respect of each defendant: 1. Are you sure that Mrs Tizzard died as a result of the violence inflicted upon her during the course of the burglary? If no, not guilty. If yes, go to Q2. 2. Are we sure that this defendant used such violence upon Mrs Tizzard? If yes, go to Q3. If no go to Q4. 3. Are we sure that when he used such violence against Mrs Tizzard he intended either to kill her or cause her really serious bodily harm (i.e. the requisite intent for murder)? If yes, guilty of Murder if no, guilty of Manslaughter. 4. Are we sure that the co-defendant used violence upon Mrs Tizzard with the requisite intent for murder? If yes, then go to Q5. If no, go to Q7. 5. Are we sure that this defendant was party to (i.e. took part in) a joint plan to do violence upon Mrs Tizzard and had the requisite intent for murder? If yes, guilty of Murder. If no, go to Q6. 6. Are we sure that this defendant realised at any time that his co-defendant might use violence upon Mrs Tizzard with the requisite intent for murder and nevertheless continued to take part? If yes, guilty of Murder. If no, go to Q7. (But note, that if the co-defendant went or may have gone beyond the scope the joint venture [i.e. did an act not foreseen as a possibility] this defendant not guilty of murder or manslaughter). 7. In the event of the co-defendant being guilty of manslaughter as defined, are we sure that this defendant was party to a joint plan to do unlawful violence to Mrs Tizzard with an intent falling short of an intent to do really serious bodily harm? If yes, guilty of Manslaughter. If no, go to Q8. 8. Are we sure that this defendant realised that his co-defendant might use unlawful violence short of any serious bodily harm upon Mrs Tizzard (and did so) and nevertheless continued to take part? If yes, guilty of Manslaughter. If no, not Guilty."" There then followed a question relating to Wyatt alone. In taking the jury through the questions, the Judge did not give any further direction of substance which varied or was at odds with the general directions earlier given. 32. The first point taken by Mr Gold, is that the paragraph I have numbered 1 in the oral directions, was inconsistent with the authority of R -v- Powell and English [1997] 4 All ER 545 in which the House of Lords quashed the conviction on a charge of murder of a secondary party where, despite being party to a joint attack on a police officer with wooden posts, his case was (which the jury might have accepted) that he was unaware that one of his co-assailants was carrying and might use a knife which was in fact the means by which the fatal injury was inflicted. Mr Gold submitted that the tightening of the ligature which appeared to have caused the death of the victim in this case could and should have been regarded as fundamentally different from the other violence used in the course of the attack. This submission seems to us entirely without merit. First, at that point in his summing-up the Judge was simply considering the position of a defendant whom the jury were satisfied was responsible for inflicting the violence in consequence of which the victim died. He had not yet moved on to consider the position of one whose liability was alleged to be secondary or to arise as a result of joint enterprise with the principal offender. Furthermore, as between the Defendants, it was Wyatt who, in effect, sought to run a Powell and English defence, whereas it was Rattigan's case that he had not inflicted or been party to the infliction of violence at all, having left the scene before the victim appeared upon it. 33. The second point of criticism made is that, when the Judge moved on to deal with the question of joint enterprise at the paragraphs numbered 2 and following, he did so in a defective manner. No objection is taken to the paragraphs we have numbered 2, 3 and 4. But paragraphs 5 and 6 are the subject of criticism. As to paragraph 5, Mr Gold has submitted that, whilst paragraph 5 is correct in respect of a defendant going beyond the common purpose (""what the other had agreed or realised he might do"") it fails to spell out the consequences upon the co-defendant. That does not seem to us to be a good point. The Judge had already made the point in paragraph 4 that mere presence at the scene of a crime was not enough to prove guilt without there being actual participation in the offence and, in the paragraph criticised, he made clear that, if one defendant acted beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do, that defendant alone was responsible for the act concerned. In relation to paragraph 6, Mr Gold, this time in context of the Judge's direction as to joint enterprise, makes the same criticism as in respect of paragraph 1, namely that the Judge does not there consider or explain the principle in Powell and English with reference to the possibility that by squeezing the T-shirt tight around the victim's neck so as to result in asphyxiation, one defendant might move beyond the scope of the joint enterprise. If paragraph 6 is considered in isolation then there is some force in the criticism. However, the paragraph was not uttered in isolation. It was uttered by way of counterpoint to the preceding paragraph where the Judge had made clear that if one defendant went beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do that defendant alone was responsible for the act in question (i.e the Powell and English point). 34. The third criticism relates to paragraph 7 of the summing-up where the Judge dealt with the question of withdrawal from any joint plan or agreement to do violence in the presence of burglary. It is perhaps worth observing that was an issue which only arose on the defence advanced by Rattigan; however the Judge dealt with it in respect of ""each defendant"". Mr Gold accepts that paragraph 7 is an accurate statement of the position in respect of pre-planned violence, but complains that the Judge did not go on to deal with the position if the violence which occurred in the course of the burglary was ""spontaneous"". In that respect he relies upon the authority of R - v - Mitchell and King 163 JP.75. In that case, this court made clear that where two or more persons, without pre-planning spontaneously attacked another who died in consequence of the attack, but one of the attackers desisted and walked away before the fatal blow occurred, it was not necessary for the defecting attacker to escape conviction for murder that he should have communicated his withdrawal to those who were continuing with the attack, such express communication of withdrawal only being necessary in the case of a pre-planned attack. This decision is to be contrasted with the case of R - v - Becerra and Cooper 62 Cr. App. R. 212 in which it was held that where, on a charge of murder committed during the course of the burglary, a co-defendant had provided the killer with the knife used in the killing, it was insufficient to establish withdrawal that he had departed from the scene with the words ""let's go"" shortly before the stabbing. 35. Mr Gold submits that it was likely that the jury came to the conclusion that such violence as occurred was spontaneous upon the appearance of the victim on the scene. He submits that the jury should have been specifically directed that, if that were or might be so, and, if Rattigan's evidence of jumping out of the window was or might be true, he was entitled to be acquitted. 36. The answer to this submission, as advanced by Mr Langdale QC for the Crown, is as follows. Insofar as the Crown suggested, and the jury accepted, a preconceived plan to use violence, the direction of the judge was a correct statement of the law. Insofar as the jury might well have regarded it as a case of `spontaneous' violence, the matter was also adequately covered by the judge's direction upon joint enterprise and in particular his observation in paragraph 5 that `if, on your findings, one defendant in using violence on Mrs Tizzard, went beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do, this defendant alone is responsible'. Mr Langdale submits that, insofar as the jury were not sure that there was any pre-planned violence before the burglary occurred, the case of Rattigan did not in fact call for a direction based on a defence of ""withdrawal"". That was because Rattigan's case was not that, having participated in a degree of violence applied to the victim, he withdrew from it. It was simply that he left the scene before any violence occurred. 37. We consider that, so far as concerns the directions of law which were given by the judge, Mr Langdale is correct that they were not open to criticism. We would add that, in any event, the question of `withdrawal' from a joint enterprise, and what constitutes an effective withdrawal, is in reality an aspect of the problem of assessing whether or not it has been established that a defendant who is alleged to be liable as an accessory has in fact encouraged or assisted the perpetrator of the particular offence with the requisite intent. In this case, with each party blaming the other as the perpetrator of the violence, that is the way the judge treated it. As a result of lengthy discussions between counsel and the judge, it was decided that the same series of questions should be posed in respect of each defendant, the judge first having directed the jury (as he did) as to the necessity for the prosecution to establish a `joint plan or agreement to use violence on the victim whether as a matter of pre-planning or as arising on the spur of the moment' when the victim first appeared on the scene, it also being made clear that one defendant could not be liable for an act of violence by the other which went beyond what the other agreed or contemplated. That is precisely the pattern which the summing-up followed. 38. Subject to one further point of criticism by Mr Gold as to the form of question 6, in answering the questions as directed, the verdict of the jury that Ratigan was guilty of murder must have been either on the basis that it was he who inflicted the fatal violence upon Mrs Tizzard (see questions 2 and 3) or that Wyatt did so, with Rattigan taking part in a joint plan to that end, each with the requisite intent for murder (see question 4 and 5), or that Wyatt did so with Rattigan realising that he might do so and nevertheless continuing to take part in the attack (see question 6). Further, in relation to question 6, there was a specific warning against a verdict of murder if Wyatt's violence went or might have gone beyond the scope of what was foreseen as a possibility. 39. The criticism of Mr Gold in relation to the form of the question 6 is limited to this. He says that by insertion of the words `at any time' , the judge left open the possibility that, even if the jury accepted in toto that Rattigan's version was true or might be true, they might have found him guilty on the basis that, having left the scene before the occurrence of any violence, it occurred to him that Wyatt might be using violence upon Mrs Tizzard with intent to kill her, but nevertheless he stayed in the car ready to transport Wyatt from the scene. 40. We first note that the reason for the insertion of the words `at any time' as discussed between the judge and counsel was for the purposes of consistency with the judge's proposed direction that a shared intention to do violence could exist either as a result of a pre-existing plan or one arising on the spur of the moment . Second, that the wording of question 6 in any event called for consideration of Rattigan's state of mind prior to an attack by Wyatt in which Rattigan nevertheless continued to take part . Plainly, once he had jumped through the window (if he did) he would have ceased to take part in the use of violence. Third, it was never the case for the prosecution that Rattigan should be treated as guilty on the basis that he should have realised that violence was or might be used by Wyatt after he left the scene; nor did the judge so suggest in summing-up. In our view the point taken by Mr Gold is a fanciful one, taken with the benefit of hindsight and unrelated to the basis upon which the case was conducted and the directions discussed. 41. The short point in this appeal, as it seems to us, is first and last a complaint that the judge did not, as he easily could have done, specifically instruct the jury that, if they accepted Rattigan's evidence in toto (i.e.that there was no plan or anticipation of violence before the defendants entered the flat and that Rattigan had departed the scene through the window before the victim arrived on the scene), he was entitled to be acquitted. 42. So far as that is concerned, it certainly seems to us that, in a case of this kind where by reason of `cut throat' defences similar questions arise in the case of each accused, it is desirable to assist the jury by relating those questions specifically to the case advanced by each defendant. While the issues may be identical, their practical application usually needs to be tailored to the particular case of each defendant. However, in a case where the ingredients of the defence and the matters in respect of which the jury must be satisfied have been made clear and where (as the judge proceeded to do in this case) the evidence of each defendant is fully re-canvassed before the jury, a failure to do so will not necessarily render the conviction unsafe. 43. It is ultimately necessary to examine the overall effect of a summing-up to see whether, when the jury retire, the essential issues are clear. It was Rattigan's case, made clear to the jury by the judge in the course of his summing-up that, at no time was he party to violence or a plan to use violence against anyone, believing the flat to be empty, and that he departed the scene before any violence occurred and without any realisation that it might occur, waiting in the car for Wyatt in the belief that he could not find it. That was made manifestly clear to the jury and, if they accepted it might be true, the judge's directions and questions required a verdict of not guilty. The only alternative version of events before the jury was that of Wyatt, whose version had Rattigan upon the scene as an active participant (and indeed the protagonist) in violence `spontaneously' applied to the victim, once she had interrupted the burglary. It is plain that the jury accepted the essentials of Wyatt's account (which was in any event consistent with the injuries to the victim) and rejected Rattigan's account that he was absent from the scene when any violence occurred. Although the judge failed to tell the jury in terms that if Rattigan's account was or might be true he was entitled to be acquitted, that was the import of the summing-up and of the questions put to the jury. Acceptance of Rattigan's version of events would plainly have led to his acquittal in answer to questions 6 and 8. Having carefully considered the whole of the summing-up, we are satisfied that the essential issues were made clear to the jury and we are satisfied that Rattigan's conviction was safe. © 2000 Crown Copyright BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2000/73.html","Rattigan & Anor, R v [2000] EWCA Crim 73 (19th December, 2000) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 73 (19th December, 2000) Case Nos: 2000/00031/X3 2000/00032/X3 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE COURT OF APPEAL (CRIMINAL DIVISION) B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE POTTER MR JUSTICE POOLE and SIR BRIAN SMEDLEY - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - REGINA - V - (1) PATRICK JOSEPH RATTIGAN (2) TERENCE EDWARD WYATT - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (Transcript of the Handed Down Judgment of Smith Bernal Reporting Limited, 190 Fleet Street London EC4A 2AG Tel No: 020 7421 4040, Fax No: 020 7831 8838 to the Court) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Phillip Meredith Esquire ( instructed by the Crown Prosecution Service) Jeremy Gold Esquire ( instructed by the Registrar for the first appellant - the second appellant was not represented) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Judgment As Approved by the Court LORD JUSTICE POTTER: INTRODUCTION 1. On 8 th December 1999 in the Crown Court at Lewes before Potts J and a jury, the Appellant Rattigan and the Applicant Wyatt were each convicted unanimously of murder, and on the same date were sentenced to life imprisonment. On 27 th November 2000 we dismissed Rattigan's appeal against conviction by leave of the single judge, and the (non-counsel) application for leave to appeal against conviction of Wyatt, following refusal by the single judge. We stated that we would give our reasons later and do so now. 2. On the morning of 17 th December 1998, the body of 88-year-old Mrs Hilda Tizzard (""the victim"") was found at her flat in a block of sheltered housing called The Poynings. Her hands and feet were tied, she had suffered numerous injuries during the night. The cause of death was compression of her neck with a ligature formed from a T-shirt tied round her neck. Rattigan and Wyatt both admitted having burgled the victim's flat the previous night, and the cause of death was not in dispute. Each denied murder, blaming the other. The prosecution put the case against both on the basis of joint enterprise. The issue for the jury was whether either or both of the accused had the necessary intent and were responsible for the victim's death. THE EVIDENCE 3. The evidence for the prosecution was as follows: The two accused had been released from Chichester Police Station on the afternoon of 16 th December 1998 having been held overnight on suspicion of theft. They spent the evening of 16 th December 1998 drinking at a public house in Bognor Regis with two female friends called Sonia and Jamey. They left at about 10.30 to 11 p.m. and returned to Sonia's flat in Bognor Regis where there was an argument between Rattigan and Wyatt. Jamey said that Wyatt was winding Rattigan up. Rattigan attacked him and Wyatt ended up lying on the floor. His head was cut. Both men left the flat at about 11.45 p.m. ostensibly to go to Chichester Hospital. Later Jamey and Sonia went to the hospital to pick them up, but they were not there. The women returned to their flat in Bognor at about 1.30 a.m. to find the two men outside the flat. They said that they had not been to the hospital but had gone to Worthing instead. After an expedition to buy some cigarettes, Rattigan and Sonia went to bed together and Wyatt stayed in the same room as Jamey. In cross-examination she described an occasion the month before when Rattigan and Wyatt had brought two stolen mountain bikes to the flat. She also agreed that she had on occasion offered to act as ""look-out"" when Rattigan was burgling. There was also an occasion earlier that month when stolen items were brought back to the flat. 4. At 1.41 a.m. on the night of 16 th /17 th December, the police received a 999 call, reporting a burglary at The Poynings. The caller said he was from Brighton and gave his name as ""Elkins"". He said he had seen two men running from the building in the direction of the railway station and had heard someone shouting behind them. The caller said he was calling from Lewes. Subsequently a police officer heard the tape of the call and identified the voice as being that of Rattigan (as was not disputed). 5. Mr Smith, the manager of Poynings said that the victim was physically fit, although profoundly deaf and sometimes confused. He had the care of her pension book as she sometimes mislaid things, and on Wednesday 16 th December had given her £33.90 which he saw her put into a small plastic wallet with her credit cards. . On the morning of 17 th December at about 9.30 a.m. he entered the victim's flat with her care worker and found her body on the floor, and he called the ambulance and the police. Mr White, a paramedic who arrived soon after, checked the victim's pulse with difficulty because of the material tied tightly around her neck. Her hands were tied together so tightly that the ligature was cutting into the skin. The same ligature ran to her feet which were also tied together. The Scenes of Crimes Officer moved the victim's body finding underneath it two pieces of leather strap, four pieces of string and two pieces of cloth. He noticed two paper envelopes on the floor and found shoe marks on the grass at the rear of the building. A forensic expert gave evidence that footprints outside the window and also upon the two envelopes found within the flat corresponded to shoes belonging to Rattigan and Wyatt which were later obtained by the police. 6. Dr Borek, the prosecution pathologist who examined the victim's body said that the T-shirt ligature tied around her neck was flush with the skin but not cutting into it. The complex set of bindings from shoelaces secured her left wrist and right thumb to her ankles. Her hands were tied in front of her body, the ligature around the right thumb being very tight and deeply indented the skin. Scattered petechiae (pin-point haemorrhages) were present in and around the left eye and over the neck, all consistent with pressure from the ligature around the neck, as was congestion found in the scalp lower face and earlobes. There were 18 minor abrasions to the face, head and neck including an area of injury to the upper lip and scratch under the skin, which might have been caused as the victim struggled. There were 21 bruises and abrasions on the right arm and 15 on the left, including marks made by the ligatures. There were further abrasions and bruises to the legs and back of the trunk. Bruising around the nostrils and chin led Dr Borek to conclude that there had been a blow to the mouth splitting the upper lip and bruising the tongue. There was deep bruising to the muscles of the neck and its deeper tissues consistent with significant pressure which, in Dr Borek's view was far greater than would have been caused by the ligature in the condition that she found it after death. It would have had to have been tighter at an earlier stage. There were six areas of injury to the trunk, the most significant of which was a fracture to the sternum of a type which would have been caused by a blow or firm pressure. Further bruising to the chest wall and corresponding bruising to the back indicated a similar cause, such as would come from a person kneeling upon the victim's chest. Dr Boric concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia following compression of the neck with a broad ligature, the facial injuries suggesting an attempt to smother associated with a struggle. The appearance of petechiae in the eyelids suggested that the pressure on the neck must have been sustained for a minimum of 15 to 30 seconds. 7. The evidence of the Defendants was as follows. 8. Rattigan accepted that he had several previous convictions for offences against the person and property, including robbery, and for dishonesty. He said that having served a sentence for causing grievous bodily harm he had attempted to change his lifestyle, meeting and forming a friendship with Wyatt in April 1998. They had embarked together on a health course at Chichester College where they met Sonia and Jamey who were students on the same course. All four became friends. In November 1998 he had started stealing again. He said that following his release from custody with Wyatt on the afternoon of 16 th December they went to a flat in Canada Grove and in the evening went out drinking. They returned to the flat about 10.20 p.m. and where he and Wyatt had an argument and he hit Wyatt who did not retaliate. They left the flat to go to hospital, but Wyatt said he did not need to go, so they walked around for a while and decided to commit a burglary. Rattigan stole a Metro car and they drove around eventually coming to the block of flats at The Poynings. Having discovered an open window at the rear of the building, he looked through the window and saw the light was on in a room which appeared to be empty. He pulled the window open and climbed through it, Wyatt following. He began to search the bureau and Wyatt went towards the front door to begin searching there. He said he would not have entered the flat had he known that someone was there. Having searched the bureau he went to the bedroom area and found a handbag in the wardrobe. He took a wallet which he found in the handbag. At that point he heard a door open. He said he turned to Wyatt who was at the other side of the room and said ""come on"", jumping out of the window immediately without seeing anyone come in. He returned straight to the car and did not look back to see if Wyatt was following. He said he did not find the victim's pension money. He only looked through her wallet after leaving the flat, having stolen it in the hope that it contained money. 9. Rattigan said that, having left the flat, he sat in the car for 20 to 25 minutes waiting for Terry Wyatt in the belief he could not find the car. Wyatt returned to the car and Rattigan said ""what kept you?"", but Wyatt did not reply. Nor did he say anything of what had happened on the journey back to Sonia's flat. Rattigan drove to the back of some flats near Canada Grove, parked the car and left it there. He said that it was only as they were walking towards Canada Grove that Wyatt told him that an old lady had come into the flat, that he had panicked and tied her up. Rattigan said that he told Wyatt that he was going to phone the police and did so, despite Wyatt's attempts to persuade him not to. Rattigan said that he had no idea that the victim was dead or dying; he simply wanted the police to untie her. He said that the name ""Elkins"" was the first that came into his head. He said that they had not told Sonia and Jamey anything. He said that he did not find out that the victim had died until Wyatt told him so on the evening of Friday 18 December, having heard it on the radio. They did not discuss what they would say if they were arrested. On Monday 21 December he was arrested and interviewed, being re-interviewed several times on 22, 23 and 24 December before being charged with murder on 24 December. He made no comment at any of the interviews. He said that that was because he was distressed and afraid and did not want to be seen as a ""grass"". 10. Wyatt, giving evidence, confirmed his meeting and friendship with Rattigan. He said he was aware of Rattigan's criminal past and had seen him inject heroin on one occasion. He knew that Rattigan was carrying out burglaries and that he had become involved in drug dealing by the end of September 1998. He said that at the end of November he had stolen two mountain bikes with Rattigan and they had also carried out a burglary together when he (Wyatt) was drunk. He confirmed his and Rattigan's movements and the incident at the flat at Canada Grove. He said that, Rattigan having offered to take him to hospital, they left the flat together heading towards the railway station in order to go to Chichester Hospital by train. However, Rattigan told him they were not going to hospital but to do a burglary. Wyatt said he refused, but Rattigan held a screwdriver to his stomach and threatened to stab him if he did not go with him. Wyatt said he was petrified and agreed to act as look-out. He said that Rattigan broke into the Metro and told him to get in. They arrived at the building which he now realised was The Poynings. Rattigan announced they would do a burglary there and, following another argument, Wyatt agreed to stay outside the back as look-out. When Rattigan found the window was open, Wyatt gave him a leg-up in order to get in, but remained outside himself. He then heard Rattigan's voice telling him to come inside and he jumped in. He saw that Rattigan had someone on the floor and was holding one hand over the person's mouth and the other around the collar area, with his knee on the person's chest. Rattigan told him to hold on to the person whom he realised at that point was a woman. He put his hand over her mouth while Rattigan ransacked the flat. Rattigan then told Wyatt to take his hand off her mouth and asked the woman repeatedly where her money was. She said at first it was in the teapot and then began to shout for help. At this Rattigan lost his temper and punched her three times in the chest. Wyatt said he tried to intervene. He said that it had not crossed his mind that Rattigan might beat her up or kill her. They then heard a noise and Rattigan said that they had to tie her up to prevent her raising the alarm. He said that Rattigan tried unsuccessfully to tie her hands with a cloth and then told Wyatt to do it. Wyatt said he pulled the laces out of two pairs of shoes and he and Rattigan both tied her up. Rattigan pulled a cloth tightly round her mouth in order to gag her. He said that he (Wyatt) had had to tie her thumbs tightly because she was flapping her hands while he was tying the knot. 11. Wyatt said that he then headed towards the window and heard the woman gurgling. He looked back and saw that Rattigan was pulling the gag tighter; he warned him he was choking her and loosened the gag. The woman appeared to have fainted and Rattigan appeared to begin an attempt at artificial respiration. Wyatt said he knelt beside her and checked that she had a pulse and was breathing. He scooped the contents of her handbag which Rattigan had given him back into the bag and left through the window. He looked back to see Rattigan throwing cushions and bedding over the victim before he left. Rattigan snatched the bag from him and threw it over the hedge (where it was found later by the police). Wyatt said he looked through the window to check that the victim was all right and saw her move. It was his immediate wish to telephone the police, but Rattigan told him there was no need to do so because he had pulled the alarm as they were leaving. 12. In cross-examination Wyatt suggested that the victim must be been strangled between the time he had checked her pulse and gone to the window. He said that Rattigan remained aggressive as they returned to the car and made their way to the bottom of Canada Grove where they dumped the car near the flats. He said that he (Wyatt) went to the phone box in order to call the police, but Rattigan snatched the phone from him and, after an abortive attempt to report the matter to the Samaritans, they telephoned 999. On Friday evening he heard that the victim was dead; his reaction was disbelief. He told Rattigan the news and was told to keep quiet. When Rattigan was arrested on 21 st December, Wyatt attended the police station and made a witness statement in which he gave a lengthy explanation as to his and Rattigan's movements over the period, much of which was untrue. In particular, it did not reveal the participation of either of them in the burglary and killing. He said that he had lied because he was afraid of Rattigan and also being charged with murder himself. Not long after giving his witness statement he was arrested on 21 December and interviewed in the presence of his solicitor on 22 and 23 December. At those interviews he made no comment and was charged with murder on 24 December. Questioned about his physical involvement in the attack on the victim, he said that he had put his hand over her mouth, on Rattigan's instructions to stop her calling out. While he did so she was humming hymns and not struggling. When Rattigan asked her ""where's your fucking money"", she mentioned a teapot. He said he could not explain why he had not called an ambulance afterwards, but repeated that he had been afraid. The Application of Wyatt 13. At trial an application was made on behalf of Wyatt to exclude the evidence of his witness statement, made on 21 December 1998 for his arrest. The defence submitted it was clear that Wyatt was by that time suspected of participating in the killing of the victim and that therefore he should have been cautioned (which he was not) prior to being interviewed and making a statement. The Judge held a voir dire, hearing evidence from the police officers supervising the case, Detective Chief Inspector (by then Detective Superintendent) Ladley and Sergeant Dixon; also from Detective Sergeant Buttle who interviewed Wyatt and took the statement. 14. When rejecting the application, the Judge stated that he considered the evidence of Ladley and Buttle was of crucial importance. It was clear from the contemporaneous notes made by Ladley, and from his evidence, that Wyatt was regarded and noted as a ""significant witness"" rather than a suspect (the description accorded to Rattigan) at the time he made his statement. The Judge said that the officers had no reason to consider Wyatt a suspect from an earlier visit to Canada Grove, when they were simply trying to find the whereabouts of Rattigan and spoke briefly to Wyatt. Rattigan was arrested at 5 p.m. on 21 December and Wyatt, who was with him at the time, accompanied the police to the police station. Wyatt was then taken to Chichester so that his interview could be recorded on video; the Judge said that he accepted Superintendent Ladley's evidence that it was normal practice to record interviews with significant witnesses on video. He also accepted Ladley's assurance that, prior to interview, he was not aware that Wyatt had a criminal record and he had no grounds to believe that Wyatt had been involved with Rattigan in the murder. It was only when Ladley obtained Wyatt's account from the officers who conducted the interview and became aware that he claimed to have been at the flat in Canada Grove at the relevant time, contrary to the account the police had earlier received from Jamey, that Wyatt became a suspect, and he was arrested at 11.30 p.m. that night. The Judge also concluded that Buttle, who had interviewed Wyatt for several hours, had no reason to treat him as anything other than a witness. 15. Having seen extracts from the video of Wyatt's interview, the Judge accepted Buttle's account that the purpose of the interview was to find out the movements of Rattigan over the relevant period and that, had Wyatt made any admissions or appeared to implicate himself in any way, Buttle would have proceeded to caution him. The Judge found that at no stage was any such admission made and that Wyatt did not achieve the status of a suspect prior to comparison of his statement with the information received from Jamey. 16. The principle ground of Wyatt's application for leave to appeal is that the Judge wrongly allowed the admission of the witness statement taken from Wyatt for the purposes of cross-examination by both the co-defendant and the prosecution as to the lies which were told in it. It is said that the admission of the statement, which was referred to in closing speeches and the summing-up, undermined Wyatt's credibility and substantially prejudiced his case. 17. It may well be the fact that lies were told in that statement and that Wyatt sought to distance himself and Rattigan from the scene of the crime did undermine Wyatt's credibility. However, the police were not obliged to caution Wyatt if they reasonably regarded him only as a witness and not as a suspect as the judge found, nor are we persuaded that there are any grounds for interfering with the findings of the judge or the exercise of his discretion. 18. The grounds of appeal against conviction settled by Counsel on behalf of Wyatt which failed to persuade the single judge to grant leave, were supported by an advice in which those grounds were elaborated. That advice asserts that the police had grounds to suspect Wyatt because he was an associate of Rattigan's, living with him at Canada Grove and known to have been released from Chichester Police Station earlier that day. He was also with Rattigan at the time of his arrest. However, it is also acknowledged that the second man suspected of participation in the crime with Rattigan was a man called Lovegrove, also known as an associate of Rattigan and living near Canada Grove. It is said that, on that basis, and the content of the video interview, at which DC Buttle told Wyatt that he was being questioned with regard to his (not Rattigan's) movements at the time of the murder, indicate that the Judge was wrong in the view which he took and the ruling which he made. We do not accept that argument. The Judge gave lengthy and careful consideration to the arguments raised on Wyatt's behalf at the time of the application and was in the best position to make a judgment whether, at what was a very early stage of the police investigations, they had reached the point when the police ought reasonably to have regarded and treated Wyatt as a suspect. We see no good basis on which to interfere with the decision of the Judge in that respect. 19. The second point taken in the grounds of appeal settled by Counsel is that, at one point in the summing-up, the Judge referred to Wyatt accepting in evidence that he had put his hand over the victim's mouth and nose , when in fact he only admitted covering her mouth. We do not have a transcript of the evidence of Wyatt. The Judge was plainly quoting from his notebook in the passage complained of, which reads as follows in the transcript of the summing-up: ""I put my hand over her mouth because I was told to do it. It was like a nightmare. I had my hand over her mouth, on her nose, to stop her shouting; and one under her chin. She was humming hymns; she was trying to calm me down. I didn't think to take my hand off her mouth. She was not struggling. It was then she was asked by Rattigan: `Where's your fucking money?' and mentioned a teapot."" 20. If, as Counsel suggests in his advice, that note was erroneous, we do not think that, on its own, the mistake amounts to a ground of appeal. It is stated in counsel's advice that the point was not sought to be made a subject of correction before the jury, because to have done so would only have highlighted a part of the evidence against Wyatt, which, even on his own story, showed his participation in the violence and restraint applied to the victim. In any event, the remark that Wyatt's hand was on her nose does not in itself indicate that he was obstructing her breathing at the time and his evidence was plain that he took his hand away in order that she could answer Rattigan's questioning. Accordingly we do not think there would be any prospect of establishing that the verdict was unsafe upon the ground asserted. 21. In further grounds of his own composition, Wyatt complains under six heads which are additional to those already settled by counsel and which are supported by an ""Advice"" also in Wyatt's own hand, elaborating on those grounds. We have read both documents carefully and, for the reasons briefly indicated below, find that they afford no arguable grounds of appeal. 22. First it is complained that the judge erred in ruling inadmissible under s.78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act a cell confession allegedly made by Rattigan to a witness/fellow prisoner called Sims. The judge cannot be faulted for his decision in this respect in relation to evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution. If, for the purposes of Wyatt's defence, direct evidence of the confession was required, that was a matter for Wyatt's solicitors. 23. Second, it is complained that the judge allowed the prosecution to adduce evidence from Jamey which supported Rattigan's defence, while directing the jury to disregard it in relation to Wyatt. It is not made clear to which aspect of the evidence this complaint refers, but there is no reason to suppose that the judge was in error in this respect. 24. Third, it is complained that Wyatt's advisors failed to follow up allegations that he had been unlawfully detained in December 1998 prior to the taking of the witness statement to which we have referred and fourth, that the defence negligently delayed in instructing a pathologist on behalf of Wyatt so as to be able to contest the findings of the police pathologist. Neither of these deficiencies can afford a ground of appeal and we note that in relation to the fourth complaint no tangible disadvantage to the defence of Wyatt is identified. 25. Fifth, there is a further complaint of negligence on the part of the defence in failing to investigate Wyatt's claim that it was he who made a telephone call to the Samaritans, before Rattigan took over and phoned the police. In that respect it is said he was disadvantaged in that Rattigan was enabled to appear to be the party actively concerned for the victim's welfare, rather than Wyatt. While it may be that in this respect Wyatt was placed at a disadvantage, it cannot afford any ground for an appeal. 26. Finally, it is complained that counsel gave inaccurate and detrimental advice in first advising that Wyatt should exercise his right to silence in interview with the police and subsequently in advising that Wyatt's statement should deal with the details of the earlier burglary or burglaries. Again, such a complaint cannot now afford a ground of appeal. 27. In those circumstances, we dismiss Wyatt's application. The Appeal of Rattigan 28. The Judge's summing-up to the jury on Tuesday 8 th December 1999 was a long and careful one which lasted all day. On the preceding Friday and Monday, the Judge had discussed and eventually agreed with Counsel before they addressed the jury a list of written questions to be placed before the jury as an aid to their deliberations and which the Judge incorporated and elaborated in his summing-up. This was plainly an advisable course because of the complications arising from the conflicting accounts of the Defendants in relation to the Crown's case of joint enterprise and the ""cut throat"" defences conducted. 29. Despite the agreement upon the list of questions, the broad ground of appeal in this case is that they did not provide an appropriate framework for the consideration of Rattigan's case, if factually accepted by the jury, and that the summing-up was an inadequate supplement so far as the Judge's legal directions in relation to `joint enterprise' and `withdrawal' from joint enterprise were concerned. In that respect the criticisms centre upon passages in the summing-up which extend over some four pages of transcript from which is it necessary to quote in some detail. 30. Having referred to the uncontested conclusion of the pathologist that the victim had died in consequence of the violence done to her, which neither Defendant had suggested was accidental or justified, the Judge gave the following oral directions (as to which, for convenience of reference, I have numbered the paragraphs quoted): ""1. It follows from that, that whoever you find is responsible for inflicting the violence, or was party to that violence, is - if you make those findings - at the least, guilty of manslaughter. And I did not understand, in the addresses of either Counsel for the Defence, any suggestion to the contrary ... 2. The Prosecution's case is that these defendants committed the offence of murder together. Where a criminal offence committed by two or more persons, each of them may play a different part; but if they are in it together, as part of a joint plan or agreement to commit the offence then they are each guilty ... 3. The words ""plan"" and ""agreement"" do not mean there has got to be any formality about it: an agreement to commit an offence may arise in advance, for example to go to a house and burgle and use violence on the householder if necessary. Or it may arise on the spur of the moment to do violence to the householder who disturbs the burglars. Nothing need be said at all; it can be made good with a nod or a wink, a knowing look; an agreement can be inferred from the behaviour of the parties. The essence of joint responsibility for a criminal offence is that each defendant shared the intention to commit the offence and took part in it, however great or small, so as to achieve that aim. 4. So your approach to this case should be as follows: If, looking at the case of either defendant, you are sure that with the requisite intent for murder - and I am going to use that expression from time to time, that means with intent to kill, or attempt to do really serious bodily harm - he committed the offence on his own, or that he took some part in committing it with his co-defendant, he is guilty. But bear in mind that mere presence at the scene of the crime is not enough to prove guilt; there must be participation in the offence. 5. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is common ground here .. that there was a joint plan to commit a burglary. Not disputed. But if, on your findings, one defendant, in using violence on Mrs Tizzard, went beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do, this defendant alone is responsible for the act and is therefore guilty of murder, if he had the requisite intention for murder, or, if otherwise, of manslaughter. 6. But if you are sure that the co-defendant realised that the other might use violence in furtherance of the burglary the law is that, by taking part in the burglary with that knowledge, he accepted the risk that his co-defendant could act in that way, he adopted his co-defendant's acts and is responsible for them. 7. In respect of each defendant remember this: if you are sure that that defendant joined in a joint plan or agreement with his co-defendant to do violence in the furtherance of burglary to Mrs Tizzard if necessary, the Crown must make you sure that he did not withdraw from the plan before the fatal blows were struck; that is, that he had not a change of mind and had made it clear to his co-defendant, by words or actions, his intention of withdrawing from the plan, that is in the sense of disassociating himself from the plan, and not merely escaping, before the defendant had time to act as he did."" 31. The Judge proceeded shortly thereafter to take the jury through the agreed form of questions which were as follows: ""You should ask yourself these questions in respect of each defendant: 1. Are you sure that Mrs Tizzard died as a result of the violence inflicted upon her during the course of the burglary? If no, not guilty. If yes, go to Q2. 2. Are we sure that this defendant used such violence upon Mrs Tizzard? If yes, go to Q3. If no go to Q4. 3. Are we sure that when he used such violence against Mrs Tizzard he intended either to kill her or cause her really serious bodily harm (i.e. the requisite intent for murder)? If yes, guilty of Murder if no, guilty of Manslaughter. 4. Are we sure that the co-defendant used violence upon Mrs Tizzard with the requisite intent for murder? If yes, then go to Q5. If no, go to Q7. 5. Are we sure that this defendant was party to (i.e. took part in) a joint plan to do violence upon Mrs Tizzard and had the requisite intent for murder? If yes, guilty of Murder. If no, go to Q6. 6. Are we sure that this defendant realised at any time that his co-defendant might use violence upon Mrs Tizzard with the requisite intent for murder and nevertheless continued to take part? If yes, guilty of Murder. If no, go to Q7. (But note, that if the co-defendant went or may have gone beyond the scope the joint venture [i.e. did an act not foreseen as a possibility] this defendant not guilty of murder or manslaughter). 7. In the event of the co-defendant being guilty of manslaughter as defined, are we sure that this defendant was party to a joint plan to do unlawful violence to Mrs Tizzard with an intent falling short of an intent to do really serious bodily harm? If yes, guilty of Manslaughter. If no, go to Q8. 8. Are we sure that this defendant realised that his co-defendant might use unlawful violence short of any serious bodily harm upon Mrs Tizzard (and did so) and nevertheless continued to take part? If yes, guilty of Manslaughter. If no, not Guilty."" There then followed a question relating to Wyatt alone. In taking the jury through the questions, the Judge did not give any further direction of substance which varied or was at odds with the general directions earlier given. 32. The first point taken by Mr Gold, is that the paragraph I have numbered 1 in the oral directions, was inconsistent with the authority of R -v- Powell and English [1997] 4 All ER 545 in which the House of Lords quashed the conviction on a charge of murder of a secondary party where, despite being party to a joint attack on a police officer with wooden posts, his case was (which the jury might have accepted) that he was unaware that one of his co-assailants was carrying and might use a knife which was in fact the means by which the fatal injury was inflicted. Mr Gold submitted that the tightening of the ligature which appeared to have caused the death of the victim in this case could and should have been regarded as fundamentally different from the other violence used in the course of the attack. This submission seems to us entirely without merit. First, at that point in his summing-up the Judge was simply considering the position of a defendant whom the jury were satisfied was responsible for inflicting the violence in consequence of which the victim died. He had not yet moved on to consider the position of one whose liability was alleged to be secondary or to arise as a result of joint enterprise with the principal offender. Furthermore, as between the Defendants, it was Wyatt who, in effect, sought to run a Powell and English defence, whereas it was Rattigan's case that he had not inflicted or been party to the infliction of violence at all, having left the scene before the victim appeared upon it. 33. The second point of criticism made is that, when the Judge moved on to deal with the question of joint enterprise at the paragraphs numbered 2 and following, he did so in a defective manner. No objection is taken to the paragraphs we have numbered 2, 3 and 4. But paragraphs 5 and 6 are the subject of criticism. As to paragraph 5, Mr Gold has submitted that, whilst paragraph 5 is correct in respect of a defendant going beyond the common purpose (""what the other had agreed or realised he might do"") it fails to spell out the consequences upon the co-defendant. That does not seem to us to be a good point. The Judge had already made the point in paragraph 4 that mere presence at the scene of a crime was not enough to prove guilt without there being actual participation in the offence and, in the paragraph criticised, he made clear that, if one defendant acted beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do, that defendant alone was responsible for the act concerned. In relation to paragraph 6, Mr Gold, this time in context of the Judge's direction as to joint enterprise, makes the same criticism as in respect of paragraph 1, namely that the Judge does not there consider or explain the principle in Powell and English with reference to the possibility that by squeezing the T-shirt tight around the victim's neck so as to result in asphyxiation, one defendant might move beyond the scope of the joint enterprise. If paragraph 6 is considered in isolation then there is some force in the criticism. However, the paragraph was not uttered in isolation. It was uttered by way of counterpoint to the preceding paragraph where the Judge had made clear that if one defendant went beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do that defendant alone was responsible for the act in question (i.e the Powell and English point). 34. The third criticism relates to paragraph 7 of the summing-up where the Judge dealt with the question of withdrawal from any joint plan or agreement to do violence in the presence of burglary. It is perhaps worth observing that was an issue which only arose on the defence advanced by Rattigan; however the Judge dealt with it in respect of ""each defendant"". Mr Gold accepts that paragraph 7 is an accurate statement of the position in respect of pre-planned violence, but complains that the Judge did not go on to deal with the position if the violence which occurred in the course of the burglary was ""spontaneous"". In that respect he relies upon the authority of R - v - Mitchell and King 163 JP.75. In that case, this court made clear that where two or more persons, without pre-planning spontaneously attacked another who died in consequence of the attack, but one of the attackers desisted and walked away before the fatal blow occurred, it was not necessary for the defecting attacker to escape conviction for murder that he should have communicated his withdrawal to those who were continuing with the attack, such express communication of withdrawal only being necessary in the case of a pre-planned attack. This decision is to be contrasted with the case of R - v - Becerra and Cooper 62 Cr. App. R. 212 in which it was held that where, on a charge of murder committed during the course of the burglary, a co-defendant had provided the killer with the knife used in the killing, it was insufficient to establish withdrawal that he had departed from the scene with the words ""let's go"" shortly before the stabbing. 35. Mr Gold submits that it was likely that the jury came to the conclusion that such violence as occurred was spontaneous upon the appearance of the victim on the scene. He submits that the jury should have been specifically directed that, if that were or might be so, and, if Rattigan's evidence of jumping out of the window was or might be true, he was entitled to be acquitted. 36. The answer to this submission, as advanced by Mr Langdale QC for the Crown, is as follows. Insofar as the Crown suggested, and the jury accepted, a preconceived plan to use violence, the direction of the judge was a correct statement of the law. Insofar as the jury might well have regarded it as a case of `spontaneous' violence, the matter was also adequately covered by the judge's direction upon joint enterprise and in particular his observation in paragraph 5 that `if, on your findings, one defendant in using violence on Mrs Tizzard, went beyond what the other had agreed or realised he might do, this defendant alone is responsible'. Mr Langdale submits that, insofar as the jury were not sure that there was any pre-planned violence before the burglary occurred, the case of Rattigan did not in fact call for a direction based on a defence of ""withdrawal"". That was because Rattigan's case was not that, having participated in a degree of violence applied to the victim, he withdrew from it. It was simply that he left the scene before any violence occurred. 37. We consider that, so far as concerns the directions of law which were given by the judge, Mr Langdale is correct that they were not open to criticism. We would add that, in any event, the question of `withdrawal' from a joint enterprise, and what constitutes an effective withdrawal, is in reality an aspect of the problem of assessing whether or not it has been established that a defendant who is alleged to be liable as an accessory has in fact encouraged or assisted the perpetrator of the particular offence with the requisite intent. In this case, with each party blaming the other as the perpetrator of the violence, that is the way the judge treated it. As a result of lengthy discussions between counsel and the judge, it was decided that the same series of questions should be posed in respect of each defendant, the judge first having directed the jury (as he did) as to the necessity for the prosecution to establish a `joint plan or agreement to use violence on the victim whether as a matter of pre-planning or as arising on the spur of the moment' when the victim first appeared on the scene, it also being made clear that one defendant could not be liable for an act of violence by the other which went beyond what the other agreed or contemplated. That is precisely the pattern which the summing-up followed. 38. Subject to one further point of criticism by Mr Gold as to the form of question 6, in answering the questions as directed, the verdict of the jury that Ratigan was guilty of murder must have been either on the basis that it was he who inflicted the fatal violence upon Mrs Tizzard (see questions 2 and 3) or that Wyatt did so, with Rattigan taking part in a joint plan to that end, each with the requisite intent for murder (see question 4 and 5), or that Wyatt did so with Rattigan realising that he might do so and nevertheless continuing to take part in the attack (see question 6). Further, in relation to question 6, there was a specific warning against a verdict of murder if Wyatt's violence went or might have gone beyond the scope of what was foreseen as a possibility. 39. The criticism of Mr Gold in relation to the form of the question 6 is limited to this. He says that by insertion of the words `at any time' , the judge left open the possibility that, even if the jury accepted in toto that Rattigan's version was true or might be true, they might have found him guilty on the basis that, having left the scene before the occurrence of any violence, it occurred to him that Wyatt might be using violence upon Mrs Tizzard with intent to kill her, but nevertheless he stayed in the car ready to transport Wyatt from the scene. 40. We first note that the reason for the insertion of the words `at any time' as discussed between the judge and counsel was for the purposes of consistency with the judge's proposed direction that a shared intention to do violence could exist either as a result of a pre-existing plan or one arising on the spur of the moment . Second, that the wording of question 6 in any event called for consideration of Rattigan's state of mind prior to an attack by Wyatt in which Rattigan nevertheless continued to take part . Plainly, once he had jumped through the window (if he did) he would have ceased to take part in the use of violence. Third, it was never the case for the prosecution that Rattigan should be treated as guilty on the basis that he should have realised that violence was or might be used by Wyatt after he left the scene; nor did the judge so suggest in summing-up. In our view the point taken by Mr Gold is a fanciful one, taken with the benefit of hindsight and unrelated to the basis upon which the case was conducted and the directions discussed. 41. The short point in this appeal, as it seems to us, is first and last a complaint that the judge did not, as he easily could have done, specifically instruct the jury that, if they accepted Rattigan's evidence in toto (i.e.that there was no plan or anticipation of violence before the defendants entered the flat and that Rattigan had departed the scene through the window before the victim arrived on the scene), he was entitled to be acquitted. 42. So far as that is concerned, it certainly seems to us that, in a case of this kind where by reason of `cut throat' defences similar questions arise in the case of each accused, it is desirable to assist the jury by relating those questions specifically to the case advanced by each defendant. While the issues may be identical, their practical application usually needs to be tailored to the particular case of each defendant. However, in a case where the ingredients of the defence and the matters in respect of which the jury must be satisfied have been made clear and where (as the judge proceeded to do in this case) the evidence of each defendant is fully re-canvassed before the jury, a failure to do so will not necessarily render the conviction unsafe. 43. It is ultimately necessary to examine the overall effect of a summing-up to see whether, when the jury retire, the essential issues are clear. It was Rattigan's case, made clear to the jury by the judge in the course of his summing-up that, at no time was he party to violence or a plan to use violence against anyone, believing the flat to be empty, and that he departed the scene before any violence occurred and without any realisation that it might occur, waiting in the car for Wyatt in the belief that he could not find it. That was made manifestly clear to the jury and, if they accepted it might be true, the judge's directions and questions required a verdict of not guilty. The only alternative version of events before the jury was that of Wyatt, whose version had Rattigan upon the scene as an active participant (and indeed the protagonist) in violence `spontaneously' applied to the victim, once she had interrupted the burglary. It is plain that the jury accepted the essentials of Wyatt's account (which was in any event consistent with the injuries to the victim) and rejected Rattigan's account that he was absent from the scene when any violence occurred. Although the judge failed to tell the jury in terms that if Rattigan's account was or might be true he was entitled to be acquitted, that was the import of the summing-up and of the questions put to the jury. Acceptance of Rattigan's version of events would plainly have led to his acquittal in answer to questions 6 and 8. Having carefully considered the whole of the summing-up, we are satisfied that the essential issues were made clear to the jury and we are satisfied that Rattigan's conviction was safe. © 2000 Crown Copyright"

On 28 May 2024, he was sentenced for the attempted murder, to an extended determinate sentence of 20 years 4 months, pursuant to section 279 of the Sentencing Act 2020, comprising a custodial term of 17 years 4 months and an extended licence period of 3 years. No separate penalty was imposed in regard to the stalking offence. He appeals against sentence by leave of the Single Judge. He is represented by Mr Aubrey KC who appeared also in the court below. We are grateful to Mr Aubrey for his concise and focused submissions both in writing and amplified orally before us today. The Facts The appellant and Andreea Pintili commenced a relationship in September 2020 and separated in August 2023. Andreea was pregnant with the appellant's child. However, the appellant became fixated with Andreea and began stalking her. He would constantly telephone repeatedly from a withheld number. On 27 October 2023 he saw Andreea at her local train station where he pleaded with her to reconcile. The following day he followed her onto the train. He took a picture of her son and placed it on TikTok. On 31 October he put two bags of his clothing outside her address and left a voicemail message saying: ""Don't touch my clothes, I'm not going from the street until you get back together with me"", he then continually knocked on her window. He was arrested and released on bail with a condition not to contact Andreea. Andreea moved to an address in Aberfan in an attempt to escape him. He obviously discovered her whereabouts and on 30 November waited for her as she took a train to work and again pleaded with her to reconcile. Andreea saw the appellant later that afternoon visiting her new address. The appellant told the friend he was staying with at the time that he was going to stab Andreea's new partner. That friend gave evidence that he was aware of the appellant leaving the house every day between 4.00 am and 5.00 am to travel to Aberfan to look for Andreea's new partner. On 1 December the appellant sent messages to his sister in Romania saying: ""What can I say? Andreea got back with her ex. I haven't been in work for a week. I've been following them every day, and today I found out where it is."" Another message read: ""Yes, whores must die. Why should they put my son under his name? Not once in a lifetime will that ever happen."" He also said that he would either ""Go to jail or kill myself if I can."" In the morning of 5 December the appellant, armed with a knife travelled to the road in Aberfan where Andreea was living. He hid behind a parked car. Andreea, returning home after escorting her children to school, was approached from behind and grabbed by her arm. She was 37 weeks' pregnant at the time and instinctively held her arms over her stomach. The appellant told Andreea he had a knife and would kill her if she did not follow his instructions which were to go into her house. Andreea fell to the floor as she tried to break free, at which point the appellant started to stab her and did so several times. A Ms Kira Terrett was out walking her dog nearby and saw what was happening. She screamed and ran towards them to try to help, at which point the appellant fled. Andreea was taken to hospital. She had three superficial defensive wounds to her thumb, a penetrating wound to the right side of her back, measuring 3 to 5 centimetres in length and 1 centimetre in depth and another penetrating wound to the left side of her back with the same measurements. There was a further wound to superficial tissues of her back. At hospital she received morphine, and the wounds were closed with deep sutures. Fortunately, a scan confirmed that her unborn child was unharmed and she was discharged from hospital the following day. In her victim impact statement Andreea said she felt ""lucky to be alive after this harrowing experience"". When she felt him stabbing her in the back she thought ""that was it"" and she was going to die. She is convinced that if Ms Terrett had not witnessed the attack and screamed at the appellant he would have continued until her death. She remained very anxious about what the appellant had done and had sleepless nights and nightmares just thinking about it. She continued to feel anxious whenever she left the house and relived the day repeatedly. She had been physically unwell due to the injuries sustained to her back, but the scars that remained were a constant reminder of what the appellant had done. The attack had affected her social life and undermined her confidence completely. She felt she would never be safe from the appellant and felt scared and anxious at the thought that she is the mother of his child and, once released, his sole intention will be to locate and kill her and the child. The appellant was of previous good character. The judge had regard to a pre-sentence report and the psychiatric report which was prepared on the appellant's fitness to plead. Sentencing the appellant the judge realistically identified the lead offence of the attempt murder and said that she proposed to sentence in respect of that offence to reflect the overall offending as indicated by the stalking that had taken place, and the charge under section 2A of the Act. She had regard to the Overarching Sentencing Guideline on Domestic Abuse. She determined that the attempt murder fell within category B2. Category B (high culpability) because the appellant took a knife to the scene intending to use it and having used it to commit the offence and furthermore the fact the offence was planned or premeditated. In relation to harm, although she found Andreea's physical injuries were not of the most serious type, that was entirely fortuitous. The harm intended was already reflected in the nature of the offence itself, that is attempted murder indicating an intention to kill. It was foreseeable that the repeated stab injuries might have caused serious physical or psychological harm. The contents of Andreea's victim personal statement demonstrated that she had suffered serious physical or psychological harm , albeit not amounting to category 1 harm. The judge found the offence was aggravated by the fact that the offence was committed while the appellant was on bail with a condition not to contact Andreea and it had been committed in a domestic context. Andreea was more vulnerable because she was 37 weeks' pregnant and because of the risk to her unborn child. Although the appellant had desisted in his attack, the judge was satisfied to the appropriate standard that it was only because of the intervention of the passerby. Further, she found there was no true remorse. In mitigation the judge took into account the psychiatric report and the appellant's lack of previous convictions. The judge was satisfied that there was a significant risk that the appellant would commit further specified offences likely to cause serious physical or psychological harm to another and in particular a very high risk of serious harm towards Andreea and to any of her future partners. If imposing a determinate sentence after trial, she concluded that the least period of imprisonment she would have imposed to reflect the overall offending, would have been one of 26 years. Allowing full one-third credit for his guilty plea the sentence would therefore be one of 17 years and 4 months. However, since that sentence did not fully address the risk that the appellant currently represented, it was necessary to impose an extended sentence in order to protect the public in the future with an extended licence period of 3 years which was imposed. The appeal Realistically, Mr Aubrey concedes that there can be no appeal against the finding of dangerousness or the imposition of an extended sentence. He acknowledges that this was an appalling and terrifying attack and does not seek to undermine that fact. His single and focused point on appeal is that the judge was wrong to categorise the lead offence as falling within B2 rather than within category B3 of the guidelines. Therefore, even taking into account the aggravating features of the case, the sentence was manifestly excessive. The judge had determined that Andreea's physical injuries were not of the most serious type. Mr Aubrey submits that Andreea's victim personal statement did not establish that she had suffered serious psychological harm, beyond that incorporated in the expectation that anyone who had been the victim of an attempted murder would necessarily suffer some psychological harm to know that they had been the victim of such an attack. He argues out section 63(3) of the Sentencing Act 2020, to which the judge referred, and which requires the court to consider not only the harm caused but also that intended or foreseeably to be caused, distracted the judge. This was, after all, an offence of attempted murder where the intent to kill had been proved. The starting point for a category B3 case was one of 20 years with a range of 15 to 25. Discussion We are satisfied that the correct categorisation of the physical harm occasioned to Andreea should be 3 rather than 2, as the judge found in her sentencing remarks. However, we disagree with Mr Aubrey's submission regarding the judge's categorisation of the psychological impact of the offence, which is not so easily traduced. In any event, the aggravating features of the offending as identified by the judge would, if this offence had been categorised as a B3 offence, undoubtedly uplift the starting point of 20 years towards the top of the range of 25 years. In any event, we notice specifically that the sentencing guideline provides that: ""For offences involving an extreme nature of one or more very high or high culpability factors a sentence higher than the offence range or an extended or life sentence may be appropriate."" We have seen CCTV footage recording the appellant lying in wait behind a parked car and the commencement and continuation of his attack upon Andreea during which he repeatedly and determinately stabbed her. The judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant only desisted in his attack because of the passerby's screams and obvious intent in running towards the scene to intervene. We agree, both with the judge and Mr Aubrey, that it was fortuitous that the injuries caused were not more severe. This case featured, as Mr Aubrey recognised, both of the category B high culpability factors, namely that the offender took a knife to the scene explicitly intending to kill Andreea's partner, but also implicitly Andreea and therefore necessarily the unborn child according to the appellant's text message to his sister. There was premeditation and considerable planning involved. We regard the CCTV footage to amply demonstrate and justify this as an offence involving ""the extreme nature"" of the culpability factors to call for a higher sentence than the offence range and an extended sentence. Consequently, whether the starting point of 26 years was arrived at by the judge by categorising the offence as falling within category B2 or B3, with appropriate uplift for the aggravating circumstances, this sentence is not manifestly excessive. The appeal is therefore dismissed.

He was sentenced to three years and two months' imprisonment for possession of a controlled drug of Class A drug (cocaine) with intent to supply to others. That sentence was ordered to run consecutively to a sentence that the appellant was already serving for conspiracy to murder. He was also sentenced to two years' imprisonment for possession of a Class B drug (ketamine), again with intent to supply, and to four months' imprisonment for possession of a Class B drug (cannabis) with intent to supply. He was also sentenced to one year's imprisonment for possession of counterfeit currency; to one year's imprisonment for possession of criminal property; and to four months' imprisonment for another offence of possession of criminal property. All of those sentences were ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence for the possession of cocaine with intent to supply. The appellant now appeals against sentence by leave of the single judge. The facts may be stated shortly. Police officers were searching for the appellant in connection with the offence of conspiracy to murder. That was a drugs-related shooting offence which had been committed in 2019. The appellant had avoided arrest since that time. On 3 August 2022, he was seen to leave a property in West London. That property was searched. Police officers recovered 341 grams of cocaine (with a purity of 88 per cent), just over one kilogram of ketamine, and 18.8 grams of cannabis. They also found counterfeit currency with an attributed value of £32,640, genuine sterling to the value of £20,590, and euros to the value of £1,080. Multiple phones and SIM cards were found, along with drugs paraphernalia such as packing material, glass vials with labels, plastic boxes and bags. The appellant had been sentenced in December 2022 to 20 years' imprisonment for the offence of conspiracy to murder. He was not sentenced for the drugs and other offences at that time. There was a delay in the proceedings for those offences. He was ultimately sentenced for those offences in November 2024. At that time he was aged 33, and his only previous conviction was for the conspiracy to murder. The judge did not consider that a pre-sentence report was necessary. Nor do we consider that a report is necessary. The judge took the offence of possession of cocaine with intent to supply as the lead offence. The appellant had argued that his role was a significant role. The prosecution placed it at the top end of significant, largely it seems because they did not have telephone evidence available to show precisely what the appellant was doing. In his sentencing remarks, the judge noted that there had been ""much discussion and submissions"" on whether the appellant occupied a leading or a significant role for the purposes of the Sentencing Council guidelines. The judge said that it was right to say that there were features which indicated a significant role but that, taking a step back and comparing the features of a ""significant"" and a ""leading"" role, he took the view that the appellant had performed a ""leading"" role. He took that view because the appellant had bought drugs on a commercial scale. He considered that that was the case because of the quantity of drugs  one kilo of ketamine and one third of a kilo of cocaine  and because of the purity of the cocaine (88 per cent). He found that the appellant must have had close links to the original source of the drugs, because in the normal course of events drugs start off at their purest, but become diluted before they are sold on the street. He considered that the appellant had also expected substantial financial advantage from the sale. The appellant had bought at one price and had sold at another. He noted that the appellant had been in possession of £20,590 which had not been explained. He took the money as reflective of the scale of the operation. For all those reasons the judge concluded that the appellant had performed a ""leading"" role. A category 3 offence involved 150 grams of cocaine, for which the starting point would be eight years and six months' imprisonment. For category 2, the indicative amount was one kilogram, for which the starting point would be 11 years' imprisonment. The judge took the term of nine and a half years  that is a point between the starting points for categories 2 and 3  to reflect the amount of the drug. He reduced that by one third to reflect the delay in sentencing and also the other mitigation. The resulting sentence was one of six years and two months' imprisonment. He then reduced that further by one third to reflect the appellant's guilty plea, which resulted in a sentence for that offence of three years and two months' imprisonment. The judge did not treat the previous conviction for conspiracy to murder as an aggravating feature, although he said that he could have done so. He ordered that the sentence for the cocaine offence be served consecutively to the earlier sentence for the conspiracy to murder. The judge took a similar approach for the other offences. The ketamine offence was a category 2 offence, given the quantity, and for an offender performing a ""leading"" role the starting point was six years' imprisonment. The judge again reduced that to reflect the delay and the mitigation, and then by one third to reflect the guilty plea. That resulted in the sentence of two years' imprisonment. He took a similar approach in relation to the cannabis offence. He took a starting point of one year's imprisonment, but reduced it in a similar way, resulting in a sentence of four months' imprisonment. For the offences of possession of criminal property, the judge took a starting point of three years' imprisonment, which he reduced ultimately to a sentence of one year's imprisonment for the possession of the £20,590 sterling. He took one year's imprisonment as the starting point for the offence involving the euros, which he reduced ultimately to four months' imprisonment. He took a starting point of three years' imprisonment for the possession of the counterfeit currency, which he reduced in a similar way to reflect the mitigation and the guilty plea, resulting in a sentence of one year's imprisonment. All of those sentences were ordered to run concurrently with the sentence for the cocaine offence. Miss Chinner, who appears on behalf of the appellant, submitted that the starting points of nine years and six months' imprisonment for the cocaine offence and six years' imprisonment for the ketamine offence were too high. She submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant had performed a ""leading"" role, as opposed to a ""significant"" role. There was no direct evidence of directing or organising buying or selling on a commercial scale. There were no text messages or ledgers. There was no evidence of links to the original source, other than the purity of the drug. Nor was it known at what purity drugs would be sold on the street. She submitted that although the appellant was in possession of significant sums of money, that did not demonstrate that the gain would be substantial, rather than significant. She drew attention to the circumstances in which the appellant, who was then of course on the run, was living as indicating that the amount of money was significant, but not substantial. In relation to the money laundering offences, Miss Chinner submitted that the level of harm from the drug dealing had already been factored into the category for the drug offences and should not have been used to increase the starting point for the money laundering offences. She submitted that there were no other factors indicating high culpability. We deal first with the offence of possession of cocaine with intent to supply. There are a number of factors identified in the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines which indicate what amounts to a ""leading"" role. These include the following three, among others: directing or organising buying and selling on a commercial scale; close links to the original source; and expectations of substantial financial advantage. In our judgment, the judge was entitled to conclude on the facts of this case that the appellant had performed a leading role. The judge was entitled to have regard to the quantity of cocaine and to its purity, together with the other evidence of packaging, as indicating selling on a commercial scale. That was reinforced by the amount of money in the appellant's possession and, indeed, the amount of other drugs (the one kilo of ketamine in particular) in his possession, all of which was indicative of supply on a commercial scale. The judge was also entitled to infer a close link to the original source, given the purity of the cocaine. He was entitled to find that the amount of drugs involved, and their purity, gave rise to an expectation of substantial financial gain. In those circumstances, given the quantity of cocaine, the judge was entitled to adjust the starting point for a category 3 offence upwards, and to increase it from eight and a half years to nine and a half years' imprisonment. Thereafter, he gave a substantial reduction for the delay and for the other personal mitigation, and the maximum reduction for the guilty pleas. In our judgment, the sentence of three years and two months' imprisonment was not manifestly excessive. In any event, even if the categorisation had been as a significant rather than a leading role, we do not consider that the sentence imposed would, on the facts of this case, be manifestly excessive. If the supply of cocaine were to be considered alone, the starting point for a significant role for a category 3 offence would be four years and six months' imprisonment, with an indicative amount of 150 grams. As the appellant was in possession of 340 grams, there would have needed to be an upward adjustment to somewhere in the region of six years' imprisonment. That would have been reduced by one third to reflect the mitigation, resulting in a sentence of four years' imprisonment. There would then be a reduction of one third to reflect the guilty plea, resulting in a sentence for the cocaine offence of two years and eight months. However, as the sentences for the cocaine offence and the other offences were to be made concurrent, the sentence for the cocaine offence would have had to have been adjusted at some stage to reflect the overall offending. That would have involved an upward adjustment, before reducing the sentence for the guilty plea. That would still have resulted, inevitably, in a sentence in the region of three years and two months' imprisonment. A sentence at that level, given the fact of the overall offending in this case, would have been amply justified. In all the circumstances, therefore, however analysed, a sentence of three years and two months' imprisonment is not manifestly excessive. Nor do we consider that the sentence for possession with intent to supply ketamine was manifestly excessive. Further, in relation to the possession of criminal property (the £20,590), we consider that the judge was entitled to regard the appellant as demonstrating high culpability. Given the amount of money involved, it was a category 5 offence within the relevant Sentencing Council guidelines, with a starting point of three years' imprisonment. The judge then reduced that to reflect the personal mitigation and made a further reduction to reflect the guilty plea. For that reason the resulting sentence is not manifestly excessive. Finally, we do not consider that there was any breach of the principle of totality by reason of the fact that the appellant was sentenced at different times for the conspiracy to murder and for the drugs and other offences. The drugs and other offences were different in kind and committed at different times from the conspiracy offence. As a matter of principle, a consecutive sentence was appropriate. The judge did not treat the earlier conviction as an aggravating factor, as he could have done. He made a substantial reduction for the delay in bringing these offences to trial. In all the circumstances, the total period of imprisonment for all the offending that the appellant had committed is not disproportionate. It is just, proportionate and merited. Accordingly, this appeal against sentence is dismissed. _________________________________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2025/1358.html","Mechita, R. v [2025] EWCA Crim 1358 (07 October 2025) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions WARNING: reporting restrictions may apply to the contents transcribed in this document, particularly if the case concerned a sexual offence or involved a child.

The two appellants were convicted at the Central Criminal Court of manslaughter and of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. Those two offences arose from a robbery which the first appellant Marshall eventually admitted but the second defendant Crump denied on the basis that although he had taken part he had been acting under duress. It was common ground that on the afternoon of 15th July 2004, and then at around midnight that same night, Marshall and a co-accused, Patterson, committed two robberies. In the afternoon they waylaid an acquaintance called Porter and attempted to rob him of money and drugs. They were armed at the time with a shotgun which on the evidence Patterson initially had in his hands but which Marshall took up subsequently to threaten the victim's father when he tried to intervene. That robbery was largely unsuccessful. The victim escaped and the defendants got away with only his keys. Marshall and Patterson then planned to rob another acquaintance called Spencer who was an old friend of Marshall. They then met the two further co-accused, the second appellant Crump and a fourth man Wilson. Late that night Spencer was invited to Marshall's flat and, whilst he was there with Marshall, Patterson, Wilson and Crump entered the flat. Patterson had the shotgun. There was inevitably no independent witness to exactly what happened after that, but by about 1 o'clock in the morning Spencer, whose hands had been tied with cable ties, had been robbed of some jewellery and had been killed by a shot from the gun. It was agreed at the trial that both Spencer and the appellant Marshall had been tied up, the object being to pass Marshall off as a victim of the robbery to which he had in fact been party. Eventually both Patterson and Marshall pleaded guilty to the first robbery and to having the shotgun on that occasion with the intent to commit an indictable offence. They also both pleaded guilty to the robbery of the dead man, Spencer. Those two, however, contested the count of murder (count 5) and that for possession of the gun with intent to endanger life on the occasion of the second robbery (count 4). Patterson's pleas to those various offences had been tendered before the trial but were necessarily in evidence before the jury. Marshall's pleas came only several days into the trial and were tendered in front of the jury. As to the robbery in which Spencer had been killed, Patterson admitted that he had been holding the gun but said that it had gone off accidentally when the dead man had struggled and put his tied hands on the weapon. Marshall contended in addition that it had never crossed his mind that Patterson would bring a loaded gun to the robbery so that he had nothing to do in any event with the death. Crump and the fourth man, Wilson, as we have indicated, both accepted that they took part in the robbery of Spencer but contended that they acted under duress, being frightened by serious threats which they said had been issued by Patterson. In the event, the jury convicted Patterson and Marshall of manslaughter rather than of murder and those two defendants also of the offence of possession of the gun with intent to endanger life. The jury acquitted Wilson and Crump altogether on count 5 (the count of murder, that is to say both of murder and of manslaughter) and also on count 4 (the firearms count). Those two defendants were convicted solely of the robbery offence in relation to Spencer. Some time after the jury had returned its verdicts and had dispersed, some printed material was found in the room which it had used. It was material which had plainly been downloaded from three internet sites. Some came from the site of the Crown Prosecution Service, some from the site of some solicitors with a criminal defence practice and some from a third Home Office site. The material covered practice relating to the charging and sentencing in firearms cases, sentencing for robbery and sentencing for homicide, including manslaughter, together with mandatory automatic life sentences and extracts from the Practice Direction of 2004 relating to tariffs for specified periods. Printed dates on the pages suggested that the material must have been downloaded on 11th October. That is the day on which the jury had first retired, so the material had been acquired by one of them, it would appear, either that morning in anticipation of retirement or overnight, after the first half day of retirement. In the event, the jury's deliberations lasted all but two full further days. Their verdicts were returned on the afternoon of Thursday 15th October. During that time, the jury on two occasions asked questions of some detail arising from the judge's summing-up. They were about the elements of the offences of murder and of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. The learned judge dealt with them impeccably. He discussed them with counsel first and he gave the jury a careful further direction setting out the relevant law for them entirely consistently with the way in which he had explained it initially. There was before this court at one stage an application by Marshall for leave to appeal in relation to the answer to one of those questions, but on mature reflection Mr Goh abandoned that some days ago. The position now is that there is no complaint whatever about the terms in which the jury had the law explained to them, both in the original summing-up and in answer to the specific questions which they raised. As to the material which was found in the jury's room, we have, like this court in R v Karakaya [2005] 2 CrAppR 5 at 77 felt able to examine the material. That is because it is wholly extraneous to the deliberations of the jury, having, it would appear, been brought into existence by one of the jurors when not at court. Like this court in Karakaya we cannot know how many of the jurors were shown it. It is necessary to proceed upon the basis that although it may only have been one, it could have been any number of them, but plainly it was at least one. Like this court in Karakaya , we are clear that reference to this material contravened an important principle of jury trial, namely that no further material ought to be considered by the jury once it had retired. This was material that the defendants and their legal advisers did not know about and about which they could not address any arguments to the jury. Nor had the material been made public and a criminal trial takes place in public. When this kind of thing happens it is a matter of considerable concern. On the face of it, it is an irregularity which is very likely to lead to a conviction being held to be unsafe. That was the conclusion of this court in Karakaya . It is no doubt true, as Mr Altman for the Crown has submitted to us, that the material in this case was largely material which was in the public domain and to which an intelligent member of the public serving on the jury could perfectly legitimately have access. That, however, does not necessarily solve the problem. If a jury is known to have access to material in the public domain the judge is in a position to give a warning that they must concentrate entirely upon the evidence which has been given in the case. The jury's use of material which is not known to the judge or to any of the participants in the trial is something which cannot be addressed. That said, the question for this court must always be whether the verdicts which have been returned are in the particular case before it unsafe. That was the question which this court addressed in Karakaya and it is to be observed that at paragraph 18 of the judgment in that case Judge LJ expressly left open the question whether every breach of the principle to which we have referred will inevitably lead a conviction to be unsafe. Karakaya was a very different case from this. There was in that case a very plain reason why the conviction was unsafe, however few jurors might have looked at the downloaded material. The charges there were rape and indecent assault. The material which had been referred to was of a campaigning nature. Its import was to assert the strong position that people were too frequently acquitted wrongly of such offences. It was material of a kind which, if attention were paid to it, might well influence one or more jurors in their verdicts. Moreover, it was accepted that some of it was factually inaccurate and further that it would not have been admissible in the trial. Judge LJ giving the judgment of this court said of it that: ""In effect the material might have served to undermine the confidence of the jury in the fairness of the summing-up, and the accuracy of the judge's directions of law... We cannot accept that the documents should be approached as if they were no more, or not much more, than an exhortation for an unbiased assessment of the credibility of rape victims."" We have given some rather anxious consideration to the question of the safety of these convictions. If there is any real possibility that the jurors or any of them may have been influenced improperly by this material to convict either defendant of the two offences of which Marshall was convicted or the one of which Crump was convicted, then their convictions would be unsafe. In this case we observe the following factors: 1. The material is about the range of offences which exist and about sentencing. It does seem to us possible that the former element, the range of firearms offences, might have inspired one of the questions which was asked of the judge by the jury - that is to say whether there existed other firearms offences which were alternatives to count 4. That is not necessarily the only explanation for that question. The jury had been told there was an alternative to count 5 (that is to say manslaughter as an alternative to murder) and they could see from the indictment before them that there was another firearms offence of possessing a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence; indeed Marshall and Patterson had both pleaded guilty to it in relation to the first robbery. But it is at least possible that the material inspired that question. What is significant, however, about this case is that the jury asked the specific question of the judge whom the jury plainly treated, as it should have done, as the only authority on the law. It received the emphatic answer, correctly, that the only question was whether the offence charged in count 4 was proved or not and that there was no alternative verdict. 2. Otherwise the material is about sentencing. It might be possible to envisage a situation in which a jury by referring to material about sentencing for lesser offences could be led towards convicting of a more serious offence because it feared that otherwise sentences might be imposed which were lower than it would prefer to contemplate. This, however, was a jury which acquitted everybody of murder. It convicted Marshall of manslaughter. The material might have led a reader to appreciate that murder carried a mandatory life sentence and manslaughter did not, but that manslaughter might attract either a long term of years or a discretionary life sentence, but we are unable to see how Marshall could have been damaged in the verdict by the fact that the jury might have been aware of that. Nor can we see how the enquiry about alternative firearms offences could have led improperly to the verdict of guilty of manslaughter or, for that matter, of the firearms offence. Crump was convicted of robbery but again it is not possible to see how that could improperly have been brought about by the material available which demonstrated that sentences for robbery might range from upwards of 20 years, down to a few months. We do not regard as realistic the hypothesis that the jury might have thought that it could convict of robbery whether sure of guilt or not, safe in the knowledge that the sentence would be very short indeed. 3. Apart from the question to which we have already referred, this jury made several other enquiries of the judge about the law. That they made them demonstrates that they were turning to judge, as they should have done, for authoritative rulings about the law. 4. This jury returned discriminating verdicts for which there was a very clear basis. Wilson and Crump admitted that they had taken part in the robbery but there was relatively little evidence of knowledge that a gun would be used, still less that it would be either loaded or accompanied by ammunition ready for use. By contrast, Patterson and Marshall had both admitted possessing just such guns, both generally and this particular gun in a robbery a few hours earlier. Patterson admitted carrying it in the second robbery and indeed gave evidence to the effect that both he and Marshall were well aware that it was loaded. The jury resolved the issue of whether the gun had been deliberately fired at Spencer in favour of the defendants by saying that it could not be sure that it had. In the case of the Crump the jury rejected his defence of duress but there was a plain basis for doing so and no part of the content of the material can have had any bearing upon that decision. The appellants perfectly properly take their stand on the fact of the irregularity and the assertion that a verdict in such circumstances is necessarily unsafe. They are entitled so to arguse, and we are grateful for the precision and the brevity of their submissions. But no scenario has been suggested to us, nor as far as we can see can it be, by which these defendants can have been adversely affected by the material which we have seen. It follows that the taking of this material into the jury room was a clear contravention of the important principle to which we have referred. It raises immediately the question of whether the convictions are safe or not, but upon close examination we are satisfied that these are convictions which are safe. We observe, without attempting to prescribe any kind of formula, that the case underlines the importance of the direction which is conventionally given to jurors at the outset of the trial (and was given to this jury) to the general effect that the golden rule which they must apply is to try the case on the evidence alone which is what they hear in court and nothing else. That can, without drawing attention to any particular risks, conveniently be given in a form which reminds them first of the general rule, secondly of its application in a prohibition on discussion of the case with family, friends or anybody else, and quite often conveniently also with a reminder that private research, whether in the library or on the internet, should be abjured. It follows that for those reasons these appeals must be dismissed. (There then followed an appeal against sentence) LORD JUSTICE HUGHES: On behalf of Marshall, Mr Goh renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence, which application the single judge refused. The sentences which the judge passed were concurrent upon the several offences. The longest of the sentences was 18 years for manslaughter. The robbery of Spencer and the possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life attracted concurrent sentences of 12 years and the first robbery attracted 11 years (also concurrent). There were shorter concurrent terms for the other offences. Mr Goh's short proposed point is that the 18 years for manslaughter was manifestly excessive. He says that the acquittal on the count of murder means that the jury was not satisfied of either intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm. That of course, so far as it goes, is correct. Therefore he says, so far as violence goes, the intention of Marshall was limited to an intention to threaten or at most to beat with the weapon. Indeed in his grounds he expresses it as an intention to commit an unlawful act, that is to say a common assault. Of course if the defendant had been convicted of murder the sentence would have been life imprisonment and under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the specified period would have had as its starting point 30 years, which is equivalent of a determinate sentence of 60 years. However that may be, it is simply not realistic to speak of the intent being limited to common assault. The intention on the jury's verdict was to rob and to endanger life armed with a shotgun which was either loaded or had ammunition readily available for use if required and in consequence the death of the person robbed had occurred. In the event of manslaughter arising from the carrying of the knife without any additional motive for robbery and without any intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the starting point is nowadays in the region of 12 years - see Attorney General's Reference No 33 of 1996 (Latham) [1997] 2 Cr.App.R 9. Given the formidable weapon which was here carried and the intention to use it to effect a robbery within hours of doing the same to someone else, we are quite unable to say that it can properly be argued that the sentence of 18 years is manifestly excessive. In those circumstances we refuse leave.

Nor can we see how the enquiry about alternative firearms offences could have led improperly to the verdict of guilty of manslaughter or, for that matter, of the firearms offence. Crump was convicted of robbery but again it is not possible to see how that could improperly have been brought about by the material available which demonstrated that sentences for robbery might range from upwards of 20 years, down to a few months. We do not regard as realistic the hypothesis that the jury might have thought that it could convict of robbery whether sure of guilt or not, safe in the knowledge that the sentence would be very short indeed. 3. Apart from the question to which we have already referred, this jury made several other enquiries of the judge about the law. That they made them demonstrates that they were turning to judge, as they should have done, for authoritative rulings about the law. 4. This jury returned discriminating verdicts for which there was a very clear basis. Wilson and Crump admitted that they had taken part in the robbery but there was relatively little evidence of knowledge that a gun would be used, still less that it would be either loaded or accompanied by ammunition ready for use. By contrast, Patterson and Marshall had both admitted possessing just such guns, both generally and this particular gun in a robbery a few hours earlier. Patterson admitted carrying it in the second robbery and indeed gave evidence to the effect that both he and Marshall were well aware that it was loaded. The jury resolved the issue of whether the gun had been deliberately fired at Spencer in favour of the defendants by saying that it could not be sure that it had. In the case of the Crump the jury rejected his defence of duress but there was a plain basis for doing so and no part of the content of the material can have had any bearing upon that decision. The appellants perfectly properly take their stand on the fact of the irregularity and the assertion that a verdict in such circumstances is necessarily unsafe. They are entitled so to arguse, and we are grateful for the precision and the brevity of their submissions. But no scenario has been suggested to us, nor as far as we can see can it be, by which these defendants can have been adversely affected by the material which we have seen. It follows that the taking of this material into the jury room was a clear contravention of the important principle to which we have referred. It raises immediately the question of whether the convictions are safe or not, but upon close examination we are satisfied that these are convictions which are safe. We observe, without attempting to prescribe any kind of formula, that the case underlines the importance of the direction which is conventionally given to jurors at the outset of the trial (and was given to this jury) to the general effect that the golden rule which they must apply is to try the case on the evidence alone which is what they hear in court and nothing else. That can, without drawing attention to any particular risks, conveniently be given in a form which reminds them first of the general rule, secondly of its application in a prohibition on discussion of the case with family, friends or anybody else, and quite often conveniently also with a reminder that private research, whether in the library or on the internet, should be abjured. It follows that for those reasons these appeals must be dismissed. (There then followed an appeal against sentence) LORD JUSTICE HUGHES: On behalf of Marshall, Mr Goh renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence, which application the single judge refused. The sentences which the judge passed were concurrent upon the several offences. The longest of the sentences was 18 years for manslaughter. The robbery of Spencer and the possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life attracted concurrent sentences of 12 years and the first robbery attracted 11 years (also concurrent). There were shorter concurrent terms for the other offences. Mr Goh's short proposed point is that the 18 years for manslaughter was manifestly excessive. He says that the acquittal on the count of murder means that the jury was not satisfied of either intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm. That of course, so far as it goes, is correct. Therefore he says, so far as violence goes, the intention of Marshall was limited to an intention to threaten or at most to beat with the weapon. Indeed in his grounds he expresses it as an intention to commit an unlawful act, that is to say a common assault. Of course if the defendant had been convicted of murder the sentence would have been life imprisonment and under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the specified period would have had as its starting point 30 years, which is equivalent of a determinate sentence of 60 years. However that may be, it is simply not realistic to speak of the intent being limited to common assault. The intention on the jury's verdict was to rob and to endanger life armed with a shotgun which was either loaded or had ammunition readily available for use if required and in consequence the death of the person robbed had occurred. In the event of manslaughter arising from the carrying of the knife without any additional motive for robbery and without any intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the starting point is nowadays in the region of 12 years - see Attorney General's Reference No 33 of 1996 (Latham) [1997] 2 Cr.App.R 9. Given the formidable weapon which was here carried and the intention to use it to effect a robbery within hours of doing the same to someone else, we are quite unable to say that it can properly be argued that the sentence of 18 years is manifestly excessive. In those circumstances we refuse leave."

Godfrey KC appeared on behalf of the Appellant. The Crown were not represented. . ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © MR JUSTICE MARTIN SPENCER: The applicant, George Henry Knights, renews his applications for leave to appeal against his conviction for murder on 9 June 2021, following trial before His Honour Judge Statman and a jury in the Crown Court at Maidstone, and for an extension of time to do so. He also renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence. Conviction The single ground of appeal is that the conviction is unsafe because the partial defence to murder of loss of control was not placed before the jury for their consideration. Reliance is placed on the decision of this court in R v Goodwin [2018] 4 WLR 165 , where the court stated that if there is sufficient evidence to raise an issue with respect to the defence of loss of control, then it is to be left to the jury whether or not the issue had been expressly advanced as part of the defence case at trial. Whether there was sufficient evidence to raise an issue with respect to the defence of loss of control involves some brief consideration of the issues and evidence in this case, and in particular the applicant's own account. Although this account was not accepted by the prosecution, it represented the high point of the applicant's case. It was the applicant's evidence that he had been buying cocaine from the deceased for several months in increasingly large quantities, which he would sell at a profit, thereby hoping to make enough money to stop being involved in drugs and become a day trader. However, it was the applicant's case that he was looking to disassociate himself from the deceased and find an alternative source of drugs, which angered the deceased. On Friday, 23 October 2020 the deceased had come to the applicant's home to sell him drugs. The applicant weighed the cocaine using his scales. The atmosphere was such that he felt it was a good opportunity to raise again his desire to stop selling drugs and become a trader. At this point, the deceased switched moods, started shouting and became angry and intimidating. The deceased indicated that he was armed with a knife, which scared the applicant such that he felt in danger, so he calmed the deceased down. The applicant then went upstairs and armed himself with his father's commando knife, which he put down the inside of his jogging bottoms which he said he did in case he needed to defend himself. When he came downstairs, an argument broke out again with the deceased making threats against the applicant's family. A fight then broke out, starting with punches. They ended up in a struggle, grabbing each other, and the applicant was pushed, falling to the ground on his back. In doing so, the commando knife fell out of his jogging pants onto the floor. The deceased sat astride him punching him. The applicant pulled the deceased towards him, holding him against his body to stop him punching out. At that point, the deceased saw the knife and shouted, ""You've got a knife. I'm going to kill you."" The deceased suddenly had the knife in his hand and tried to stab the applicant. The applicant grabbed the deceased's arm, wrestled the knife from the deceased and lashed out with the knife once, thereby fatally stabbing the deceased in the head. As the applicant's trial counsel had pointed out, it was never his case that he lost control. Nor was there any evidence that he did, say his counsel. On the contrary, it was his case that he did only that which was necessary in the circumstances that he faced. It was the applicant's case that he was in fact at all times in control of his actions, responding appropriately to the developing situation. It was an important part of the defence case at trial that there was a single blow by the applicant, having wrestled the knife from the deceased's grip. Tactically, to have suggested to the jury that the applicant had lost control (which was not in any event his case), would have entirely undermined his case of self-defence, would have been contrary to his instructions, and indeed, the evidence. It was therefore for both evidential and tactical reasons that trial counsel did not seek a loss of control direction. The trial judge correctly and properly raised with counsel the issue of loss of control at the outset of the trial and trial defence counsel confirmed that it was not the defence case that the applicant had lost control. That position did not change. The issues at the start of the trial and throughout were self-defence and intent, as set out in the defence statement. The applicant's clear instructions from as early as the time of his arrest were that this was not a case of loss of control. Rather, he had acted out of self-defence and had not intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased. For the need to arise for the defence of loss of control to be put to the jury there must be sufficient evidence. That is not, self-evidently, the same as some evidence falling short of sufficient evidence. Furthermore, the court in Goodwin emphasised that an appellate court will give due weight to the evaluation of the trial judge, who will have had the considerable advantage of conducting the trial, hearing all the evidence and having the feel of the case. As has been said, the appellate court ""will not readily interfere with that judgment."" In our judgment, far from there being sufficient evidence, there was in fact no evidence such as to give rise to the need for a ""loss of control"" direction to the jury, and we wholly endorse the learned judge's decision not to give the jury a direction on loss of control in view of the evidence in this case. We do not agree with Mr Godfrey KC's submission that the sections of evidence set out in his advice on appeal amount to ""sufficient evidence"" to have given rise to the need for a loss of control direction. The fact that it was not a controlled situation does not mean that there was a loss of self-control. Refusing leave to appeal, the single judge said: ""It is not arguable that the partial defence of loss of control should have been left to the jury. The most fundamental reason for this is that your evidence (contained in the transcripts) does not contain any assertions of fact indicative of a loss of control. Instead, you described reacting in a logical way to the various hostile and aggressive acts alleged against the deceased. You said that you tried to calm him down, that you armed yourself with the knife as a precaution, you did not attempt to use the knife until it was used against you and you lashed out with a single blow of the knife while in fear of your life, not intending to cause serious injury. Your evidence supported your case as set out in your Defence Case Statement, which was that you used only such force as was reasonable in the circumstances. The jury could not have been pointed to any evidence which realistically indicated a loss of control. Therefore, the question of whether there was a ""qualifying trigger"" did not arise. Also, whilst the judge is required to consider the defence of loss of control even if it is not raised on a defendant's behalf, it remains relevant that this defence was not advanced on your behalf at trial. Whilst there can be circumstances which amount to both self-defence and loss of control, the two defences are quite difficult. Your case was firmly put as a case of self-defence from day one. That appears to have been entirely consistent with your instructions to your representatives. There was also no failure by the judge to consider whether loss of control did arise. It is agreed that he raised it with counsel, who confirmed (on instructions from you), that it did not."" We fully agree with the single judge and for the same reasons refuse both leave to appeal against conviction and the application for an extension of time. Sentence In sentencing the applicant, his Honour Judge Statman considered that this was a murder done for financial gain, giving a starting point of 30 years for the minimum term to be served. However, he quoted from and applied the guidance provided by this court in R v Cole [2008] EWCA Crim 1060 where, giving the judgment of the court, Leveson LJ said: ""The factors set out in paragraph 5(2) are factors which will normally lead the court to conclude that the offence was one of particularly high seriousness. If it does, then the section lays down a starting point for arriving at the minimum term of 30 years. But whether the court starts at 15 or 30 years, the sentencing exercise requires an assessment of the seriousness, having regard to the facts of the particular case; and that can result, quite properly, in a sentence that is some distance from the starting point that has been taken. I must not approach this particular sentencing exercise with rigidity. I must look to the particular facts."" From his starting point, the learned judge considered a number of aggravating and mitigating factors, applying in favour of the applicant in relation to the aggravating factors the criminal standard of proof: the fact that he was sure that this was not a case of excessive self-defence; the applicant's actions after the killing in disposing of the deceased's body, including the use of sulphuric acid; his misleading phone calls with members of the deceased's family, and lack of remorse. The mitigating factors he took into account were primarily the applicant's age; the support of his family, and in particular, his father, and the applicant's mental health problems. He then said: ""Pursuant to section 275 of the Sentencing Act 2020, the sentence of the court, as it must be, is one of life imprisonment. I have to announce the starting point. In my judgment the starting point here is one of 30 years. I am required to determine the minimum term to be served in your case. Having regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors that I have already set out at length, I am satisfied in my only mind that the minimum term in this particular case should be one of 23 years."" For the applicant, it is submitted that this minimum term was manifestly excessive. This was the immediate view of defence counsel at trial, and their advice dated 2 February 2022 has been adopted by Mr Godfrey KC. The principal submission is that the learned judge was wrong to consider that this was a murder done for gain and was therefore wrong to take a starting point of 30 years. The starting point should, it is submitted, have been 15 years. There are a number of matters to which it is submitted the learned judge had no or insufficient regard, as set out at paragraph 32 of that advice. It is submitted that there was, in fact, insufficient evidence on which the learned judge could be sure that this was a murder done for gain, and on that basis he should have taken a lower starting point, and indeed, he should have sentenced on the basis of excessive self-defence. This submission is, it is said, supported by evidence from the applicant's father of a complaint he has made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in respect of DCI Greenidge, the officer leading the investigation, about a sum of £25,000 which the applicant was said to have had in his possession on 23 October 2020, but which went missing on 25 October 2020. In an email to the court dated 3 July 2023 from Mr Godfrey, it is said that this complaint made it clear that there was never any police investigation into the ""theft"" of that sum, and: ""It would have been plainer to the sentencing judge that there was a substantial amount of cash at the applicant's house at the time it was entered by the deceased (for the purpose of selling drugs to the applicant), and so, far less likely that the fatal stabbing of the victim by the applicant was 'a murder committed for financial gain'. It is inherently unlikely that the applicant would in his own home commit a robbery of the visiting drug dealer when he was in no way short of funds."" In his submissions to us, Mr Godfrey has developed that argument, submitting that it defies logical analysis that an 18 year old, as this applicant was, should invite a man into his own home in order to rob him of a mere two ounces of drugs, and that this was clearly on the evidence a drug deal that went wrong, and he expands on the fact that the defendant was not short of evidence, referring to the evidence of the defendant's father Edward Knights, which was unchallenged, that not only did he have £25,000 in his, room but in addition, £10,000 in a joint account with his father and £6,950 in two fast access trading accounts. On that basis, Mr Godfrey submits that there was no motive for robbery, that the applicant did not need to rob Mr Chapman. In a sentencing note provided by counsel for the Crown on 9 December 2021 for the purposes of the sentencing hearing which took place on 7 January 2022, the Crown set out its case as to why the court should find that this was a murder done for gain, and we refer to paragraph 16 onwards of that sentencing note. Those submissions are further reflected in the Respondent's Notice in response to the original grounds of appeal against sentence. The Crown have also responded to the recent email from Mr Godfrey. It is clear that the Crown always disputed the father's claim that the £25,000 ever existed and the applicant himself never alleged that that sum had been stolen. He said that he removed the money from the house after the murder. As the defence Advice on Appeal Against Conviction stated: ""It was adduced before the jury, both through GK's father and GK himself, that they had been surprised when the police did not find the cash and had assumed that they had seized it. GK's instructions were that he had taken the cash out with him to the party which he attended following the killing, and could not recall whether the cash was in the bag when he returned. He was unable to say by whom or when it was taken, and they said that that remained a difficult part of GK's case."" I understand that that part of the evidence is disputed by Mr Edward Knights. Refusing leave to appeal against sentence, the single judge stated this: ""Your challenge to the judge's adoption of a starting point of 30 years depends on undermining the judge's analysis of the facts, and in particular, his finding that this offence was committed for financial gain. Having presided over the lengthy trial, the judge was well placed to reach conclusions about those facts. He correctly directed himself to apply the criminal standard of proof. It is not arguable that the evidence did not support the conclusions which he reached. The jury, having rejected your defence of self-defence, it was open to the judge to find that this was not a case of excessive self-defence but was essentially a robbery which went wrong. The judge reached measured conclusions, for example, that there was not much premeditation, and gave sufficient reasons for his reasons, for example, as to your wish to make money. The judge found that you had an 'interest in knives', not a 'fascination with knives'. There was ample evidence to support that conclusion, and the contrary is not arguable. Your grounds rightly accept that the judge's approach to starting point was not rigid and that he accepted the need to calibrate this case on its particular facts. It is not arguable that the judge failed to do this. In your grounds it is rightly accepted that the use of a knife was an aggravating factor and that your actions after the murder considerably aggravated the case. It was for the judge to assess the weight to be given to aggravating and mitigating factors, and he was entitled to find that the aggravating factors other than age and immaturity (for which he made a substantial adjustment), carried greater weight. The evidence did not persuade the judge that much weight should be given to lack of previous convictions (in view of other bad character indications); remorse (of which the judge detected little); the extent to which you acted in self-defence (the jury having rejected that defence, and the judge not being persuaded that any such element was significant); lack of intent to kill (given the nature of the knife wound inflicted on the victim's head with great force; or your personal background and psychiatric history, on which the judge commented in significant detail, noting the limits on the conclusions that could be drawn from the psychiatric report. The other key factor was age and immaturity. The judge correctly directed himself to the approach to be taken, quoting the relevant case law. Although he did not specify the number of years deducted to reflect this factor, given that the starting point was 30 years and there were significant aggravating factors, it is clear that he made a substantial adjustment to arrive at a minimum term of 23 years. It is not arguable that that sentence was manifestly excessive."" Again, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the single judge. Once it is accepted, as we do, that the learned sentencing judge was entitled to conclude that this was a murder done for gain ? whether for money or for the cocaine which the deceased had brought with him to the house ? and that the starting point for the minimum term to be served was 30 years, the minimum term in fact imposed as 23 years can be regarded as merciful, and it is not reasonably arguable that it was manifestly excessive. Leave to appeal against sentence is, accordingly, also refused. __________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2023/895.html","Knights, R. v [2023] EWCA Crim 895 (19 July 2023) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 895 No. 202201545 B4 202200381 B4 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE WILLIAM DAVIS MR JUSTICE MARTIN SPENCER HIS HONOUR JUDGE LICKLEY KC ____________________ REX - v - GEORGE HENRY KNIGHTS ____________________ Computer-aided Transcript prepared from the Stenographic Notes of Opus 2 International Ltd.

The principal submission is that the learned judge was wrong to consider that this was a murder done for gain and was therefore wrong to take a starting point of 30 years. The starting point should, it is submitted, have been 15 years. There are a number of matters to which it is submitted the learned judge had no or insufficient regard, as set out at paragraph 32 of that advice. It is submitted that there was, in fact, insufficient evidence on which the learned judge could be sure that this was a murder done for gain, and on that basis he should have taken a lower starting point, and indeed, he should have sentenced on the basis of excessive self-defence. This submission is, it is said, supported by evidence from the applicant's father of a complaint he has made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in respect of DCI Greenidge, the officer leading the investigation, about a sum of £25,000 which the applicant was said to have had in his possession on 23 October 2020, but which went missing on 25 October 2020. In an email to the court dated 3 July 2023 from Mr Godfrey, it is said that this complaint made it clear that there was never any police investigation into the ""theft"" of that sum, and: ""It would have been plainer to the sentencing judge that there was a substantial amount of cash at the applicant's house at the time it was entered by the deceased (for the purpose of selling drugs to the applicant), and so, far less likely that the fatal stabbing of the victim by the applicant was 'a murder committed for financial gain'. It is inherently unlikely that the applicant would in his own home commit a robbery of the visiting drug dealer when he was in no way short of funds."" In his submissions to us, Mr Godfrey has developed that argument, submitting that it defies logical analysis that an 18 year old, as this applicant was, should invite a man into his own home in order to rob him of a mere two ounces of drugs, and that this was clearly on the evidence a drug deal that went wrong, and he expands on the fact that the defendant was not short of evidence, referring to the evidence of the defendant's father Edward Knights, which was unchallenged, that not only did he have £25,000 in his, room but in addition, £10,000 in a joint account with his father and £6,950 in two fast access trading accounts. On that basis, Mr Godfrey submits that there was no motive for robbery, that the applicant did not need to rob Mr Chapman. In a sentencing note provided by counsel for the Crown on 9 December 2021 for the purposes of the sentencing hearing which took place on 7 January 2022, the Crown set out its case as to why the court should find that this was a murder done for gain, and we refer to paragraph 16 onwards of that sentencing note. Those submissions are further reflected in the Respondent's Notice in response to the original grounds of appeal against sentence. The Crown have also responded to the recent email from Mr Godfrey. It is clear that the Crown always disputed the father's claim that the £25,000 ever existed and the applicant himself never alleged that that sum had been stolen. He said that he removed the money from the house after the murder. As the defence Advice on Appeal Against Conviction stated: ""It was adduced before the jury, both through GK's father and GK himself, that they had been surprised when the police did not find the cash and had assumed that they had seized it. GK's instructions were that he had taken the cash out with him to the party which he attended following the killing, and could not recall whether the cash was in the bag when he returned. He was unable to say by whom or when it was taken, and they said that that remained a difficult part of GK's case."" I understand that that part of the evidence is disputed by Mr Edward Knights. Refusing leave to appeal against sentence, the single judge stated this: ""Your challenge to the judge's adoption of a starting point of 30 years depends on undermining the judge's analysis of the facts, and in particular, his finding that this offence was committed for financial gain. Having presided over the lengthy trial, the judge was well placed to reach conclusions about those facts. He correctly directed himself to apply the criminal standard of proof. It is not arguable that the evidence did not support the conclusions which he reached. The jury, having rejected your defence of self-defence, it was open to the judge to find that this was not a case of excessive self-defence but was essentially a robbery which went wrong. The judge reached measured conclusions, for example, that there was not much premeditation, and gave sufficient reasons for his reasons, for example, as to your wish to make money. The judge found that you had an 'interest in knives', not a 'fascination with knives'. There was ample evidence to support that conclusion, and the contrary is not arguable. Your grounds rightly accept that the judge's approach to starting point was not rigid and that he accepted the need to calibrate this case on its particular facts. It is not arguable that the judge failed to do this. In your grounds it is rightly accepted that the use of a knife was an aggravating factor and that your actions after the murder considerably aggravated the case. It was for the judge to assess the weight to be given to aggravating and mitigating factors, and he was entitled to find that the aggravating factors other than age and immaturity (for which he made a substantial adjustment), carried greater weight. The evidence did not persuade the judge that much weight should be given to lack of previous convictions (in view of other bad character indications); remorse (of which the judge detected little); the extent to which you acted in self-defence (the jury having rejected that defence, and the judge not being persuaded that any such element was significant); lack of intent to kill (given the nature of the knife wound inflicted on the victim's head with great force; or your personal background and psychiatric history, on which the judge commented in significant detail, noting the limits on the conclusions that could be drawn from the psychiatric report. The other key factor was age and immaturity. The judge correctly directed himself to the approach to be taken, quoting the relevant case law. Although he did not specify the number of years deducted to reflect this factor, given that the starting point was 30 years and there were significant aggravating factors, it is clear that he made a substantial adjustment to arrive at a minimum term of 23 years. It is not arguable that that sentence was manifestly excessive."" Again, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the single judge. Once it is accepted, as we do, that the learned sentencing judge was entitled to conclude that this was a murder done for gain ? whether for money or for the cocaine which the deceased had brought with him to the house ? and that the starting point for the minimum term to be served was 30 years, the minimum term in fact imposed as 23 years can be regarded as merciful, and it is not reasonably arguable that it was manifestly excessive. Leave to appeal against sentence is, accordingly, also refused. __________"

On 22 February 2021 at Preston Crown Court before Openshaw J, the applicant (who was then 26) was found not guilty of murder but guilty of an alternative offence not charged, namely manslaughter. He was acquitted of count 2, a charge of attempted murder, and count 3, a charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. On 24 February 2021 (before the same court) the applicant was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. He now renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence and for a representation order after refusal by the single judge. He is represented before us by trial junior counsel, Mr Richard English, who appears pro bono. We are very grateful to Mr English for his helpful submissions orally this morning, noting that the written submissions were drafted by his leader at trial. . The facts in brief are these. The applicant and his co-accused Dean Qayum were local Class A drug dealers in Blackburn trading as the ""Bully Line"" from the applicant's house in Walsh Street. They had around 30 customers to whom they sold heroin and cocaine. Amongst their customers were Alison McBlain and Christian Rivers. The applicant recruited Kaylib Connolly (who was then aged 18) to deliver drugs for the Bully Line, and for that purpose the applicant bought an old Fiat Punto. . On 18 November 2019, Ms McBlain and Mr Rivers had stolen drugs from the Bully Line. They had arranged for Connolly to deliver the drugs to them under a deserted and derelict railway bridge. As Connolly handed over the drugs, Mr Rivers produced a knife and ran off with Ms McBlain and the drugs without paying. Connolly reported this to the applicant and Qayum. . There was evidence from several sources that a search for Ms McBlain and Mr Rivers began on the evening of 18 November 2019. On the next evening (19 November 2019) the Fiat Punto, which had been purchased by the applicant and was being driven by Connolly with three passengers, deliberately mounted the pavement of King Street, Blackburn. It drove along the pavement and mowed down Ms McBlain and Mr Rivers. Mr Rivers was able to jump out of the way and sustained only a slight injury to his foot. Ms McBlain was struck from behind and thrown into the air. Her head hit the windscreen and her body was flung 13 metres from the point of impact. She sustained extensive fracturing to her skull with resultant brain damage which was not amenable to treatment nor was it survivable. She died two days later. Following the collision an unsuccessful attempt was made to destroy the Punto by fire. . It was the Crown's case at trial that this driving incident was in retribution for the drug theft and that what had occurred was the result of a planned revenge attack, that Mr Rivers and Ms McBlain were to be targeted and either killed or caused to suffer serious harm. . The jury were provided with written directions on the law, and a Route to Verdict to guide their discussions. Question 9 set out the various questions the jury needed to answer in relation to the charge of murder against the applicant including Question 9(iii) which asked whether the jury were sure that: ""[the applicant] intended that they would cause them [namely Mr Rivers and/or Ms McBlain] some really serious bodily harm "". . If they found the applicant not guilty of murder, the jury were directed to go on and consider the alternative of manslaughter, by a series of questions including Question 10(ii) which asked whether the jury were sure that: ""[The applicant] realised that, if found, they [namely Mr Rivers and Ms McBlain] would be attacked and would be caused some harm, albeit not really serious harm."" . The jury returned a verdict of guilty of manslaughter and it was apparent from that verdict that they were sure that the applicant had sent the team out in the Punto to search for Mr Rivers and Ms McBlain and, when found, to attack them and cause harm, albeit harm falling short of really serious harm. . In passing sentence, the judge found that the applicant could not have known or contemplated that the Punto would have been used as a weapon but he drew an inference that the applicant could not have contemplated that this group would tackle Mr Rivers, who had previous offences for violence, unarmed, so the use of arms or of some weapon was in the applicant's contemplation. . The judge referred to the Guidelines relating to Unlawful Act Manslaughter. He said that this was a case where death was caused in the course of an unlawful attack which carried a high risk, if not of death then at least of causing some grievous bodily harm which was or ought to have been obvious to the offender. This was a category B offence with high culpability. That led to a starting point of 12 years with a category range of 8 to 16 years. He said that the offending was further aggravated by the following features: the attack upon the two individuals was planned and premeditated; the attack was executed to punish them for having robbed the Bully Line of drugs and to deter others from doing likewise; the killing took place in a public place in front of shocked eyewitnesses; and there was an attempt to destroy evidence by burning the car in which the applicant was implicated. The cumulative effect of these factors required a considerable increase in the starting point. The judge rejected the applicant's submission that the offending fell within category C. Further, the judge referred to the aggravating factors mentioned in the non-exhaustive list in the Guidelines which included the use of a weapon and others being put at risk. The judge concluded that the applicant performed the leading role in the group. The judge noted that the applicant was 26. He had 15 convictions for 30 offences spanning the years from 2007 to 2020. Those previous convictions were an aggravating factor. The judge described this as a ""bad case of manslaughter"" and the term of imprisonment he imposed was 14 years. . In grounds of appeal settled by leading trial counsel a single ground of appeal is advanced, namely that the judge erred in placing this offending in category B. It is said that it should have been in category C and that placing it in category B was inconsistent with the jury's verdicts. . In oral submissions Mr English has pressed the point that the overall term of 14 years was simply too long, adopting earlier arguments based on categorisation but also standing back and taking an overview, and in particular placing reliance on the judge's finding that this applicant did not know or envisage that the car would be used as a weapon. . We are not persuaded that the applicant has an arguable case. The trial judge was well positioned to assess the role that this applicant played in this offending. The jury acquitted the applicant of murder but they convicted of manslaughter, a verdict reached after answering the various questions in the Route to Verdict. It was open to the judge to conclude that the death was caused in the course of an unlawful act, which carried a high risk of death or grievous bodily harm, or really serious bodily harm and that that risk was or ought to have been obvious to the applicant. That conclusion is not inconsistent with question 9(iii) (which the jury must have answered in the negative) or 10(ii) (which the jury must have answered in the affirmative) in the Route to Verdict. Question 10(ii) asked whether the applicant realised that some harm, albeit not really serious harm, would be inflicted. That was a question going to intention. Even if the jury could not be sure that he had realised or intended really serious harm (question 9(iii)), it was open to the judge to conclude that the applicant had nonetheless run the obvious risk of such harm being inflicted. Category B is appropriate where there is a high risk of at least really serious harm being inflicted and that risk ""was or ought to have been obvious to the offender"". That was what the judge found. He was entitled to make that finding. That puts this offending into category B not category C. The starting point was 12 years. . There were significant aggravating features noted by the judge including the use of a weapon, others being put at risk, the applicant performing a leading role in the group, the fact that this was a premeditated offence, the fact that attempts were made to destroy evidence, and that the applicant had many previous convictions. We too have stood back and considered whether the resulting sentence of 14 years is or is even arguably manifestly excessive or wrong in principle and we conclude that it is not. We refuse leave to appeal.

The applicant, then aged 30, was sentenced on 4 April 2022 to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 20 years, less time spent on remand. The deceased is Najeebullah Nakzad, known as Najeeb, who died on 28 August 2019 at the age of 19. The case against the applicant was that he was party to a joint enterprise murder involving strangling, together with Najeeb's brother, Nasrullah Nakzad. All three men had travelled to an isolated area of moorland in the early hours of that morning in two cars. The applicant and Nasrullah returned home in one of the cars later that morning, leaving Najeeb dead in the front passenger seat of the remaining car in a layby where he was discovered two days later. The facts are conveniently summarised in the Criminal Appeal Office Summary which the applicant has ssen and the contents of which we do not need to repeat for present purposes. Grounds of appeal The applicant seeks to mount a number of challenges, which we group for convenience as follows: i) A general assertion of inadequate representation. He suggests that he could not communicate properly with his solicitor as the interpreter did not speak the correct language and his solicitors failed to rectify this. He says that he did not understand the evidence against him and did not receive case papers from his solicitors, only procedural letters informing him of court dates, for example. He says that he did not get the chance to prepare a defence statement and his solicitors did not listen to his instructions in relation to Nasrullah being responsible for the murder. ii) The applicant says that in interview he was told to answer no comment and did not understand any of the questions asked. He did not understand what his barrister was saying in court, he says, nor did he understand the interpreter. He was not given a chance to speak. iii) The applicant says he did not see any DNA or forensic evidence. He was told by his legal team, he says, that the prosecution had relied on his DNA being found on a T-shirt covering the deceased, but was only told of this after trial. His telephone downloads would have helped to prove his innocence. iv) The applicant says that he suffered from depression as a result of being tortured by the Taliban. He was interviewed for a psychiatric report given his mental health problems but was not made aware of the outcome of that exercise. v) The applicant says that the deceased's family expressed a wish to give evidence on his behalf to the effect that he was innocent and Nasrullah was responsible but that evidence was never called. vi) He suggests that inadequate disclosure was given to the defence. In the normal way, a waiver of privilege was given. Junior trial counsel has responded with her recollection of events, which we have read, and to which the applicant has responded. Discussion We observe at the outset that the applicant makes no allegation of any irregularities in the trial process itself. The very experienced judge dealt with the case fairly and there is no complaint of her legal directions or summing-up. The applicant was represented throughout by experienced leading counsel and a solicitor advocate. and had the services of an interpreter. There was no application at any time to change either solicitor or counsel. It is clear that at no point during the trial was it apparent to the judge or prosecution that there was any problem of either interpretation or representation. We agree with the reasons of the single judge as to why there is no merit in any appeal. In summary only and taking the grounds raised in turn: i) Grounds 1 and 2. At no point during his five interviews with the police was there any complaint that the applicant was unable to understand the language or communicate. Further, as his junior counsel has stated, the applicant and the interpreter were both asked in terms whether or not they understood one another throughout the trial and both responded positively. The applicant was made aware of the evidence against him in his police interviews by way of extensive CCTV footage showing his movements, telephone records and records of internet use. A defence statement was served on 30 September 2021 in which a coherent account of the applicant's defence was given and no complaint in relation to legal representation, or understanding, or disclosure was identified. ii) Ground 3. As for DNA and scientific evidence, the case against the applicant did not depend on this. The DNA on the jersey found over the deceased's body matching the applicant was not relied upon. Telephone records and data were disclosed and used in the trial. Had the applicant wished to use further data he could have done so. iii) Ground 4. As for a psychological report, one was obtained for sentence indicating that the applicant suffered from PTSD as a result of treatment in Afghanistan. It is entirely unclear how that information could have assisted the applicant's substantive defence. We also note that the unused material contained the applicant's custody record in which the applicant's mental health record is shown as being considered at various stages, with no significant concerns being raised either by the applicant or any professional. iv) Ground 5. As for evidence from the deceased's family, they were in Afghanistan at the time of their son's death. There is no identified evidence which could have assisted the applicant. Any confession by Nasrullah to the murder would in any event not have exculpated the applicant; rather it would have added weight to the prosecution case that Nasrullah and the applicant were party to a joint enterprise murder. v) Ground 6. The complaint of inadequate disclosure is wholly unparticularised. There is no reason that we can identify to believe that there was any failure of disclosure. There is then the additional hurdle of the delay, significant as it is, of 127 days before this application was lodged. The applicant was advised immediately following conviction of his right to appeal. He says that he was very unwell with severe mental health issues which meant he was not fit to advance any appeal. There is no medical evidence to support such an inability whilst in custody. In any event, in circumstances where we find there to be no merit in an appeal, it is not in the interests of justice to grant the necessary extension of time.

The applicant, then aged 30, was sentenced on 4 April 2022 to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 20 years, less time spent on remand. The deceased is Najeebullah Nakzad, known as Najeeb, who died on 28 August 2019 at the age of 19. The case against the applicant was that he was party to a joint enterprise murder involving strangling, together with Najeeb's brother, Nasrullah Nakzad. All three men had travelled to an isolated area of moorland in the early hours of that morning in two cars. The applicant and Nasrullah returned home in one of the cars later that morning, leaving Najeeb dead in the front passenger seat of the remaining car in a layby where he was discovered two days later. The facts are conveniently summarised in the Criminal Appeal Office Summary which the applicant has ssen and the contents of which we do not need to repeat for present purposes. Grounds of appeal The applicant seeks to mount a number of challenges, which we group for convenience as follows: i) A general assertion of inadequate representation. He suggests that he could not communicate properly with his solicitor as the interpreter did not speak the correct language and his solicitors failed to rectify this. He says that he did not understand the evidence against him and did not receive case papers from his solicitors, only procedural letters informing him of court dates, for example. He says that he did not get the chance to prepare a defence statement and his solicitors did not listen to his instructions in relation to Nasrullah being responsible for the murder. ii) The applicant says that in interview he was told to answer no comment and did not understand any of the questions asked. He did not understand what his barrister was saying in court, he says, nor did he understand the interpreter. He was not given a chance to speak. iii) The applicant says he did not see any DNA or forensic evidence. He was told by his legal team, he says, that the prosecution had relied on his DNA being found on a T-shirt covering the deceased, but was only told of this after trial. His telephone downloads would have helped to prove his innocence. iv) The applicant says that he suffered from depression as a result of being tortured by the Taliban. He was interviewed for a psychiatric report given his mental health problems but was not made aware of the outcome of that exercise. v) The applicant says that the deceased's family expressed a wish to give evidence on his behalf to the effect that he was innocent and Nasrullah was responsible but that evidence was never called. vi) He suggests that inadequate disclosure was given to the defence. In the normal way, a waiver of privilege was given. Junior trial counsel has responded with her recollection of events, which we have read, and to which the applicant has responded. Discussion We observe at the outset that the applicant makes no allegation of any irregularities in the trial process itself. The very experienced judge dealt with the case fairly and there is no complaint of her legal directions or summing-up. The applicant was represented throughout by experienced leading counsel and a solicitor advocate. and had the services of an interpreter. There was no application at any time to change either solicitor or counsel. It is clear that at no point during the trial was it apparent to the judge or prosecution that there was any problem of either interpretation or representation. We agree with the reasons of the single judge as to why there is no merit in any appeal. In summary only and taking the grounds raised in turn: i) Grounds 1 and 2. At no point during his five interviews with the police was there any complaint that the applicant was unable to understand the language or communicate. Further, as his junior counsel has stated, the applicant and the interpreter were both asked in terms whether or not they understood one another throughout the trial and both responded positively. The applicant was made aware of the evidence against him in his police interviews by way of extensive CCTV footage showing his movements, telephone records and records of internet use. A defence statement was served on 30 September 2021 in which a coherent account of the applicant's defence was given and no complaint in relation to legal representation, or understanding, or disclosure was identified. ii) Ground 3. As for DNA and scientific evidence, the case against the applicant did not depend on this. The DNA on the jersey found over the deceased's body matching the applicant was not relied upon. Telephone records and data were disclosed and used in the trial. Had the applicant wished to use further data he could have done so. iii) Ground 4. As for a psychological report, one was obtained for sentence indicating that the applicant suffered from PTSD as a result of treatment in Afghanistan. It is entirely unclear how that information could have assisted the applicant's substantive defence. We also note that the unused material contained the applicant's custody record in which the applicant's mental health record is shown as being considered at various stages, with no significant concerns being raised either by the applicant or any professional. iv) Ground 5. As for evidence from the deceased's family, they were in Afghanistan at the time of their son's death. There is no identified evidence which could have assisted the applicant. Any confession by Nasrullah to the murder would in any event not have exculpated the applicant; rather it would have added weight to the prosecution case that Nasrullah and the applicant were party to a joint enterprise murder. v) Ground 6. The complaint of inadequate disclosure is wholly unparticularised. There is no reason that we can identify to believe that there was any failure of disclosure. There is then the additional hurdle of the delay, significant as it is, of 127 days before this application was lodged. The applicant was advised immediately following conviction of his right to appeal. He says that he was very unwell with severe mental health issues which meant he was not fit to advance any appeal. There is no medical evidence to support such an inability whilst in custody. In any event, in circumstances where we find there to be no merit in an appeal, it is not in the interests of justice to grant the necessary extension of time. Conclusion For these reasons, like the single judge, we do not consider that an appeal would have a real prospect of success. The renewed application will be refused, as is the application for an extension of time."

The following day, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 27 years. His two co-accused, Mulangala and Onyeasi, were also convicted of murder and were sentenced to custody for life and life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 23 years respectively. This is the applicant's renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence and for a representation order after refusal by the single judge. The Facts On 24 July, the applicant and his co-accused were driven to a private address in Southampton. The three men got out of the car when it was stationary at traffic lights and walked in the direction of the driveway where their victim, Dawid Such (aged 17), was cleaning his car. One of them shouted ""Get him"", at which they all started running, taking the victim by surprise, and cornering him on his own driveway. Mulangala stabbed Mr Such four times. The knife severed a number of significant blood vessels causing such a catastrophic loss of blood that there was no chance of survival. Onyeasi and the applicant prevented the victim's escape. Dawid Such fell to the floor, where he was kicked by at least two of the trio, leaving footwear impressions on his head and torso. The exact motivation for the attack was unclear. However, there had been a confrontation in Southampton town centre in the early hours of that same morning which involved at least Mulangala and Onyeasi on the one side, and Dawid Such on the other. Mulangala and Onyeasi were runners for a drug line operated by the applicant which dealt in Class A drugs. The victim was involved in supplying Class B drugs. Following this initial conflict, Mulangala and Onyeasi went back to the flat they shared. When the applicant learned of what had transpired, he took a taxi to their accommodation. The trial judge ultimately found that, during that meeting, they all planned the fatal attack before the applicant returned to his own hotel and arranged for the three of them to be driven to the victim's address later that day. The knife used in the stabbing was later recovered from Mulangala and Onyeasi's flat. It was a knife that belonged to Onyeasi which he had used for protection as part of his drug dealing. Sentence The trial judge concluded that the earlier incident in Southampton town centre was drug related. The applicant had allied himself with an act of revenge for an incident which he perceived to have been an attack on his own business. All three men were aware of ""the fearsome"" knife being taken with them, and that with the specific intention of it being used was indicative of an intention to kill. The starting point, therefore, for setting the minimum term was, by virtue of Schedule 21 paragraph 4 of the Sentencing Act 2000, one of 25 years in each case. The judge determined that Mulangala was the knifeman, Onyeasi provided the knife and the applicant was present and ""had a controlling influence over events as the older man, who wanted his business protected through violence."" This was a true joint enterprise. The aggravating features were their previous convictions, coupled with the fact that the offence had been committed to protect another criminal enterprise, namely the drug dealing business. Mulangala had previous convictions, including for assault, possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and conspiracy to burgle. He was on licence at the time he committed the murder. Onyeasi had convictions for assault and previous drug-related offending. The applicant had many more previous convictions than his co-accused, including for drugs offences, carrying weapons and serious violence. He too was on licence when he committed the murder. The judge considered that the aggravating features justified an upward adjustment of the minimum term to 27 years. Mulangala was only 20 years old and was noted to have had a very difficult upbringing. The combination of age and immaturity, as observed by the trial judge throughout the trial, went to some reduction in the starting point. Onyeasi was only 21 years old. He too had a difficult upbringing and there was medical evidence that supported a diagnosis of ADHD. He was seen to be more easily led than many and susceptible to being exploited by others. At the time of sentence, he had symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. His mental disorders, as the judge found, were not wholly unrelated to his offending. The applicant however had no mitigation. He was: ""... older and sufficiently mature to recognise the truly appalling way in which you, as a group, were behaving. You were the leader of the drugs line and I am sure had influence over the actions of your more vulnerable co-Defendants. It would have been within your power to stop what went on rather than to encourage it."" In those circumstances, the judge determined that his minimum term would remain at 27 years. The Appeal It is conceded on the applicant's behalf that the starting point and the uplift were fully justified and are not arguably manifestly excessive. However, it is said that the applicant has a justified sense of grievance that his two co-defendants were given reductions of 4 years each in their minimum terms while he received no such reduction. In this case, the applicant contends, the judge attached undue weight to the personal mitigating factors of the two younger men and gave insufficient weight to the limited role he had played in the offence. The sole ground of appeal, therefore, is upon the basis of disparity. The single judge, in refusing the application for permission to appeal said: ""Disparity is rarely a successful ground of appeal, and I do not consider that it is arguable that your sentence...is manifestly excessive on that ground. You had a leading role in the planned revenge attack on Mr Such, even if you did not stab him yourself. The Judge, who had presided over a lengthy trial, was in the best possible position to determine the level of your involvement, and there is no arguable case for challenging his factual conclusions... You were significantly older than your co-defendants who were also convicted of murder... You also had a worse criminal record. Furthermore, (as the Judge found) Mulangala was both young and immature and Onyeasi was both young and had mental health issues. All of these factors were properly reflected in the Judge's sentencing decision in respect of both you, and your co-defendants. His decision to impose a 27 year minimum term for you, and a lower 23 year minimum term for the others, was well within the scope of the sentencing discretion and cannot even arguably be criticised."" We agree. It is not arguable that there was insufficient justification to deal with the applicant differently from his co-accused. He was an older, more heavily convicted man of considerable influence upon his younger and vulnerable co-accused. Whilst the applicant may continue to suffer from a sense of unfairness and injustice, this is entirely misplaced. The renewed application for permission to appeal sentence is refused.

Tehrani KC appeared on behalf of the Appellant. Mr R Pakrooh appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © LORD JUSTICE WILLIAM DAVIS: 1 Steven Craig is now aged 59. In about 1995, when he was in his early 30s, he began a relationship with a woman named Jacqueline Kirk. (For ease of reference, we shall refer to them by their surnames only. No discourtesy is intended thereby.) Kirk was born in 1957, so she was about seven years older than Craig. Their relationship was volatile in that Craig used violence against Kirk. From time to time, her family saw her with bruises on her face. She once suffered a cracked cheekbone. On one occasion he had gone into her bedroom with a can of petrol. He poured the petrol over her and threatened to set it alight. Overall, his behaviour towards Kirk was controlling. At least some of his actions and behaviour were the result of drug and alcohol abuse on his part. 2 On 15 April 1998, Craig was with Kirk at Bath Railway Station. He was violent and threatening towards her. He then locked her in a toilet cubicle at the station and abandoned her. She was only found some hours later by a cleaner. Two days later, Craig told Kirk that he was taking her to Plymouth in his car. She agreed to do so, so as to not upset him. They left Bath. En route, Craig stopped at a petrol station. He filled an empty Coke bottle with petrol. Craig then diverted to Weston-Super-Mare. During that part of the journey he struck Kirk repeatedly even though he was driving at the time. Once they arrived in Weston, Craig appeared to calm down. They slept in the car overnight in Weston. 3 On 18 April 1998, Craig and Kirk were still in Weston. They were sitting in the car in a car park. Craig was expressing his anger in relation to Kirk's previous boyfriends. He said he was going to torture Kirk. He hit her in the mouth, drawing blood. Anticipating another beating, Kirk bent her head over as she sat in the passenger seat. In fact, Craig poured the petrol which was in the Coke bottle over her head and neck. Kirk got out of the car as did Craig. He had a cigarette in his hand. He suggested that Kirk should have one, as it may be her last. With that, he held the flame of the lighter close to her face. The petrol ignited, causing dreadful injuries which we shall describe in detail shortly. Craig's reaction was to tell Kirk to keep away from him. He apparently was concerned that he should not get burned. He did nothing to help Kirk, by trying to extinguish the flames or otherwise. 4 Initially, Kirk did not make a complaint against Craig. He told lies, saying the offence had been an accident which had occurred when Kirk had spilled petrol on herself and then lit a cigarette. 5 The relationship between Craig and Kirk, perhaps unsurprisingly, came to an end after the attack on 18 April. 6 Craig took up with a new partner. In January 1999 he raped his new partner and caused her grievous bodily harm with intent. He caused those injuries by repeatedly beating his victim with a wooden slat. However, in the course of the attack he did pour lighter fuel over her face and threatened to ignite it. In the end, he did not carry out the threat. Those offences were committed against the background of the victim wishing to end the relationship with Craig in favour of someone else. 7 When Kirk learned of what Craig had done to his new partner, she told the police exactly what had happened to her. Thus, in due course, Craig stood trial for causing grievous bodily harm to Kirk and for raping and causing grievous bodily harm to the new partner. He was convicted by a jury of all three counts. 8 The trial judge's sentencing remarks in 2000 were brief. She said that it would be difficult to conceive of a more horrendous offence than the one committed against Kirk. She said that the consequences of the offence would be with her for the rest of her life. The judge said that Craig had inflicted appalling injuries on the new partner. Though they were not to be minimised, they did fall into a different standard to those suffered by Kirk. The judge found that Craig presented ""the gravest danger to the public"". That is, in summary form, the substance of the judge's sentencing remarks. She imposed a sentence of life imprisonment in relation to each offence. The minimum term was nine years less time spent on remand. She identified the notional terms in relation to the individual offences as 18 years in respect of the attack on Kirk, and six and eight years in relation to the offences against the new partner. It would appear though that the overall sentence must have been aggregated to reflect all offending. 9 Returning to the injuries sustained by Kirk, they were life threatening and life changing. She was transferred from a hospital in Weston to a specialist intensive care unit in Bristol where she remained for three-and-a-half weeks. She had significant external burns on 35 per cent of her body, including face, neck, chest, hands, torso, upper thighs and buttocks. The burns meant that she was unrecognisable. She had severe inhalation injuries. Her mouth, respiratory tract and lungs were burned. Her vocal chords were left in a fixed and closed position. After two weeks, a tracheostomy was inserted. This allowed her to continue breathing unassisted but it by-passed her vocal chords. She did eventually learn how to speak but only very softly and with difficulty. The tracheostomy remained in place until her death. Kirk was in hospital altogether for eight-and-a-half months after the injuries were inflicted, during which time she underwent 14 operations. 10 Kirk had a son and a daughter. In 1998 the son was aged 22 and the daughter was aged 13. Both made victim personal statements after Kirk died. They described the horror of seeing their mother in hospital in the aftermath of the attack. They said their mother was in constant pain with itching from the scarring being particularly troublesome. Eating was a struggle. Their mother slept badly and suffered nightmares. She was frequently depressed. Nonetheless, she had made a life for herself despite the effects of the injuries. She did have to go to hospital on many occasions, particularly when she suffered a chest infection. 11 In August 2019, Kirk was admitted to hospital. She was seriously ill. Her intestines were swelling and herniated. As a result, pressure was being placed on her diaphragm. Had she been fit for surgery, it would have been possible to relieve the pressure; she was not, because of the injuries she suffered in 1998. Because her chest and abdomen were not able to expand, the diaphragm was fatally ruptured. On 23 August 2019, Kirk died. 12 Craig was charged with murder, the date of the offence on the indictment being identified as 23 August 2019. He was tried in the Crown Court at Bristol. The only issue for the jury was whether the injuries inflicted by him in April 1998 played a significant part in Kirk's death. The prosecution alleged that the injuries were causative in two respects. First, the scarring meant that the chest and abdomen were not able to expand; second, surgery could not be undertaken because of the risks inherent in somebody of Kirk's condition. The prosecution case was accepted and Craig was convicted of murder. 13 On 10 November 2022, Craig was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 15 years and five days. The judge concluded that the appropriate minimum term by reference to Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Code would have been 34 years. She deducted all of the time spent in custody in relation to the offence of causing grievous bodily harm of which Craig was convicted in 2000, namely the time on remand prior to that conviction and the entirety of the period in custody thereafter, including periods after the expiry of the minimum term when the Parole Board considered it not safe to release Craig or when Craig would have been recalled. That total period was just short of 19 years. 14 Craig now appeals his sentence with the leave of the single judge. He has three grounds of appeal. First, that the judge should not have applied Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Code because the true date of the commission of the offence for sentencing purposes was 18 April 1998, i.e., when the injuries were inflicted. Thus, the transitional provisions in paragraph 12 of Schedule 21 should have applied and the appropriate minimum term should have been set by reference to the practice followed by the Secretary of State in 2002. That would have led to a minimum term of somewhere between 15 and 20 years. Second, if and in so far as Schedule 21 did apply, the judge erred when she concluded that the seriousness of the offence was particularly high so as to give a starting point of 30 years. Third, even if it were appropriate to use the starting point of 30 years, there were no matters justifying increasing that starting point to 34 years. 15 We deal first with the issue of the date of the offence. The judge provided a written ruling on that issue. She had written submissions from the parties. She noted that the purpose of these transitional provisions in Schedule 21 was to avoid the imposition of a sentence which offended Article 7.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights which prohibits the imposition of a heavier penalty than one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed. 16 In argument, the defence had relied on R v Wright and Hennessy [2022] EWCA Crim 68 as authority for the proposition that the offence of murder may be complete when the causative act is committed. In that case, the trial judge had sentenced on that basis. The judge noted that it was not an issue on the appeal as to whether the trial judge's approach was correct. On the facts of the case the transitional provisions did not apply, the injuries being caused in 2006, namely well after the Criminal Justice Act 2003 had come into force. The approach taken by the judge was intended to reflect the youth of the appellants in that case at the time of the original infliction of the injuries. Thus, so found the judge, Wright and Hennessy provided no support for the defence argument. 17 The judge concluded that an essential element of the offence of murder was the death of the victim. The definition of murder requires the offender to have unlawfully killed the victim with intent to kill or to cause really serious harm. Unless and until the victim had died, there can have been no unlawful killing. Thus, Kirk was murdered on 23 August 2019. The passage of time between the unlawful act and the death may give rise to circumstances highly relevant to an offender's culpability and to factors aggravating or mitigating the offence. By that route, the court can adjust the starting point in so far as is necessary to ensure there is no injustice to an offender. The judge gave the obvious example of where the offender was particularly young at the time of the unlawful act. 18 We are quite satisfied the judge was correct in her ruling. The view taken by the trial judge in Wright and Hennessy was noted by this Court on appeal. It was not the subject of any argument. The Court did not discuss the issue of the date of the commission of the offence, whether for sentencing purposes or otherwise. It was of academic interest given the facts of the case. In our view, an offence cannot be committed until all elements thereof have been proved. Until 23 August 2019 the prosecution could not prove that Kirk had been killed. Until that date the appellant could not have been charged with murder. It was only when he was charged with murder that he could be sentenced for that offence. 19 The grounds of appeal stated that he had been sentenced more harshly than when he commenced the chain of causation which led to death. Even if that were correct, it would be of no consequence. The relevant point is when the offence was committed. The judge's ruling did not offend Article 7.1 of the Convention. Sentencing the appellant by reference to the current sentencing regime did not offend Article 7.1. 20 The second and third grounds require us to consider the judge's reasoning which led her to conclude that without any deduction of time spent in custody hitherto the appropriate minimum term was 34 years. The judge concluded that the starting point should be 30 years. The factors which led her to conclude that the seriousness of the offence was particularly high were as follows: the planned and premeditated nature of the attack; the sadistic nature of the appellant's conduct in the build-up to the attack; the appellant's awareness of the level of seriousness involved in his use of petrol. She considered the case of R v Dunstan [2016] EWCA Crim 2098 which had been referred to in the course of argument. She rejected any suggestion that that case provided support for the proposition that the appropriate starting point should be 25 years. She concluded that Dunstan was distinguishable on its facts. 21 The judge found that thereafter there were aggravating factors. First, and most significant, she identified the pattern of violence by the appellant towards Kirk which had increased over time. The appellant in a chilling way had forced her into submission over a course of months and years. Kirk was vulnerable. The appellant's behaviour was an abuse of trust. The judge, in making those observations, clearly had well in mind the overarching principles in relation to domestic abuse issued by the Sentencing Council and effective from 24 May 2018. Second, the appellant was drunk when he committed the offence. Third, the appellant's actions after he had set fire to Kirk were cowardly; he had done nothing to help her. 22 The judge went on to refer to two further aggravating factors. First, the appellant's actions involved a high level of sadism. The nature of the attack was extreme. Second, Kirk endured physical and mental suffering for 21 years, and the impact on her family over the same period had been substantial. Those various aggravating factors served to increase the minimum term to 35½ years. 23 The judge then turned to personal mitigation. She said that his behaviour from 2000 to the date of death did not assist him. The passage of time had not led him to make the most of himself. The Parole Board had not considered him safe for release until 2015. Within three years his behaviour whilst on licence had led to his recall to prison. She said that little weight could be given otherwise to the passage of time that had elapsed since the appellant had inflicted the injuries given the effect on Kirk and her family over that period. The judge accepted that there had been no intention to kill. However, she said that this had ""reduced significance, almost to vanishing point, because of the risk of her dying from what the appellant did was so obvious even if it was not his intention"". She said she gave some weight to the fact that the appellant had a sense of disappointment at being subject to further incarceration for what he had done in 1998. 24 The judge reduced the minimum term by 18 months to take account of personal mitigation thereby reducing that to 34 years. The judge considered that justice required that the minimum term to be imposed for the offence of murder should be reduced by the total time that the appellant had already spent in custody. The appellant's previous sentence was based on identical facts. Reduction was to take into account the time the appellant had spent on remand prior to the trial in 2000 and all the time that he had been detained pursuant to that sentence in 2000, including periods of recall. So it was that 18 years 11 months and 25 days was deducted from the period of 34 years, giving a minimum term of 15 years and five days. 25 Mr Tehrani KC argued that the judge had erred in setting the starting point of the minimum term at 30 years; the starting point should be reserved for the most serious of cases of which this case was not one. His submission to us was that the court in 2000, when setting a specified period of nine years' imprisonment in relation to the three life sentences, must already have taken account of the matters that placed this case in the category of particularly serious offending. Following his conviction for murder, all that the sentencing judge should have concerned herself with was how much longer the minimum term ought to have been over and above the specified period of nine years' imprisonment. This would involve a minimum term reflecting simply the fact of death and the deceased's pain and suffering prior to death. Paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 21 reads as follows: ""3(1) If - (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 2(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence ... is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when the offence was committed, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years."" Paragraph 3(2) of the Schedule gives examples of cases that would normally fall within paragraph 3(1). The list of examples is not exhaustive. It is for the court in any particular case to assess whether the facts and circumstances render the seriousness of the offence particularly high. 26 In Dunstan , to which we have already referred, this court took the view that where the offender had spontaneously poured white spirit on a woman with whom he was staying and set fire to her the case did not fall within paragraph 3(1). It distinguished the line of cases commencing with R v Jones [2005] EWCA Crim 3315 which indicate that a 30-year starting point is appropriate where there has been a deliberate and planned arson attack on a house. The court concluded in Dunstan that the starting point should have been 15 years though the many aggravating features served to increase the starting point to 25 years. However, the court said at [24]: ""That is not to say that there will not be cases where death is caused by deliberate arson in circumstances similar to the facts of this case which will properly be described as being particularly serious for the purposes of Schedule 21 ... Inevitably, these are and will be fact-sensitive and difficult assessments for a judge to make."" 27 We have no doubt that the judge was wholly justified for the reasons she gave that the facts of this case meant that the seriousness of the offence was particularly high. Her fact-sensitive assessment cannot be criticised. The circumstances and facts in this case were very different to those in Dunstan . 28 We reject the submission made by Mr Tehrani as to what the judge's task was when sentencing the appellant in 2022. The judge had to sentence the appellant for the offence of murder. The fact that another judge in 2000 imposed a sentence when the appellant was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm was of relevance to her overall assessment of the appropriate sentence, that is after she determined the correct minimum term for the offence of murder. That sentence was not to be used when considering the appropriate sentence for the offence for which this judge had to sentence the appellant in 2022. 29 The third ground of appeal is that the judge fell into the trap of double counting when increasing the minimum term to take account of aggravating factors. In writing, Mr Tehrani argued that matters taken into account by the judge must have been taken into account by the judge who sentenced the appellant in 2000 for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Thus, the judge should not have taken them into account in 2022. We reject that argument. We reiterate the appellant was being sentenced for the offence of murder. All of the factors relevant to the commission of that offence had to be taken into account by the judge. The fact that they may have been considered at the time of the earlier sentence was irrelevant to the judge's assessment of the case. The consequences of the earlier conviction and sentence properly were reflected in the adjustment of the minimum term after the starting point had been identified and adjusted to take account of aggravating and mitigating factors. 30 We should say that it is not at all clear the extent to which the judge in 2000 took into account, for instance, the domestic abuse of which the setting fire to Kirk was the culmination. Her sentencing remarks were brief. They concentrated on the horrific nature of the offence and on the danger presented by the appellant. This is a practical example of why it would not be appropriate in any case of murder to discount factors which may have been taken into account at an earlier sentencing exercise for a different offence. 31 In oral argument, Mr Tehrani also submitted that the aggravating factors identified by the judge were what had led her to the minimum term of 30 years and, therefore, should not further increase the custodial term. 32 We disagree. Her analysis related, first, to the particular circumstances of the offence and then, quite separately, a detailed recitation of the aggravating factors with particular reference to the element of domestic abuse. The judge is criticised for giving insufficient weight to the mitigating factors. It is said she identified the relevant factors but either discounted them altogether or did not give them the weight they deserved. This was a matter for the judgment of the trial judge. She was fully seized of the mitigating factors being advanced. We would have to conclude that the judge was wrong in her assessment in order to interfere. We do not and cannot reach that conclusion. If anything, we consider that the judge may have been generous to the appellant. 33 This was a horrifying and cruel attack on a defenceless woman by a controlling man. The circumstances of the attack justified the starting point of 30 years. The background of domestic abuse made the offence particularly serious. A substantial uplift from the starting point was justified. The uplift chosen by the judge cannot be described as manifestly excessive. Proper account was taken of such mitigation there was. It follows that we reject the argument that the minimum term imposed was manifestly excessive. 34 The appellant's minimum term of 15 years and five days was calculated, as we have said, by reference to all of the time he spent in custody up to the date of sentence. That overall reduction was not something to which he was entitled by statute. References in section 240ZA and section 241 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to credit the time served relate to periods of custody pursuant to a court order, namely a remand order or an order committing an offender to custody. Once the minimum term imposed in 2000 had expired, the appellant was being held until the Parole Board considered it safe to release him. From that point on he was not being held pursuant to a court order. When he was recalled to prison that was also not pursuant to a court order. 35 The judge had a discretion to go beyond the statutory regime if she was satisfied that the circumstances were exceptional: see Wright and Hennessy at [29]. That is the view she took. Self-evidently, it is not something we are asked to review now. However, we observe that the appellant may consider himself fortunate that the judge exercised her discretion to the extent she did. First, the sentence imposed in 2000 was not solely in respect of the facts which related to the fatal attack. The appellant was also sentenced in respect of quite separate offending in relation to a different victim. In so far as the overall sentence was affected by that separate offending, admittedly difficult to identify from the sentencing remarks in 2000, that part of the sentence should have had no part to play in reducing the minimum term. 36 Second, unlike the appellants in Wright and Hennessy , the appellant had not just been detained pending the Parole Board's satisfaction that it was safe to release him. He had also been recalled to prison after his initial release and prior to any recall following the death of Kirk. Whether justice required that period to be credited to him, is, in our view, arguable. In any event, the upshot is that the appellant was given full credit for all time spent in custody. That was to his advantage. It further underlines that the sentence imposed on him in 2022 was not manifestly excessive. Taking into account all the matters we have rehearsed, we dismiss this appeal. __________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2023/893.html","Craig, R. v [2023] EWCA Crim 893 (18 July 2023) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 893 No. 202203625 A1 No. 202203625 A1 B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE WILLIAM DAVIS MR JUSTICE GARNHAM HIS HONOUR JUDGE LICKLEY KC ____________________ REX V STEVEN PAUL CRAIG ____________________ Computer-aided Transcript prepared from the Stenographic Notes of Opus 2 International Ltd.

Tehrani KC appeared on behalf of the Appellant. Mr R Pakrooh appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ ____________________ LORD JUSTICE WILLIAM DAVIS: 1 Steven Craig is now aged 59. In about 1995, when he was in his early 30s, he began a relationship with a woman named Jacqueline Kirk. (For ease of reference, we shall refer to them by their surnames only. No discourtesy is intended thereby.) Kirk was born in 1957, so she was about seven years older than Craig. Their relationship was volatile in that Craig used violence against Kirk. From time to time, her family saw her with bruises on her face. She once suffered a cracked cheekbone. On one occasion he had gone into her bedroom with a can of petrol. He poured the petrol over her and threatened to set it alight. Overall, his behaviour towards Kirk was controlling. At least some of his actions and behaviour were the result of drug and alcohol abuse on his part. 2 On 15 April 1998, Craig was with Kirk at Bath Railway Station. He was violent and threatening towards her. He then locked her in a toilet cubicle at the station and abandoned her. She was only found some hours later by a cleaner. Two days later, Craig told Kirk that he was taking her to Plymouth in his car. She agreed to do so, so as to not upset him. They left Bath. En route, Craig stopped at a petrol station. He filled an empty Coke bottle with petrol. Craig then diverted to Weston-Super-Mare. During that part of the journey he struck Kirk repeatedly even though he was driving at the time. Once they arrived in Weston, Craig appeared to calm down. They slept in the car overnight in Weston. 3 On 18 April 1998, Craig and Kirk were still in Weston. They were sitting in the car in a car park. Craig was expressing his anger in relation to Kirk's previous boyfriends. He said he was going to torture Kirk. He hit her in the mouth, drawing blood. Anticipating another beating, Kirk bent her head over as she sat in the passenger seat. In fact, Craig poured the petrol which was in the Coke bottle over her head and neck. Kirk got out of the car as did Craig. He had a cigarette in his hand. He suggested that Kirk should have one, as it may be her last. With that, he held the flame of the lighter close to her face. The petrol ignited, causing dreadful injuries which we shall describe in detail shortly. Craig's reaction was to tell Kirk to keep away from him. He apparently was concerned that he should not get burned. He did nothing to help Kirk, by trying to extinguish the flames or otherwise. 4 Initially, Kirk did not make a complaint against Craig. He told lies, saying the offence had been an accident which had occurred when Kirk had spilled petrol on herself and then lit a cigarette. 5 The relationship between Craig and Kirk, perhaps unsurprisingly, came to an end after the attack on 18 April. 6 Craig took up with a new partner. In January 1999 he raped his new partner and caused her grievous bodily harm with intent. He caused those injuries by repeatedly beating his victim with a wooden slat. However, in the course of the attack he did pour lighter fuel over her face and threatened to ignite it. In the end, he did not carry out the threat. Those offences were committed against the background of the victim wishing to end the relationship with Craig in favour of someone else. 7 When Kirk learned of what Craig had done to his new partner, she told the police exactly what had happened to her. Thus, in due course, Craig stood trial for causing grievous bodily harm to Kirk and for raping and causing grievous bodily harm to the new partner. He was convicted by a jury of all three counts. 8 The trial judge's sentencing remarks in 2000 were brief. She said that it would be difficult to conceive of a more horrendous offence than the one committed against Kirk. She said that the consequences of the offence would be with her for the rest of her life. The judge said that Craig had inflicted appalling injuries on the new partner. Though they were not to be minimised, they did fall into a different standard to those suffered by Kirk. The judge found that Craig presented ""the gravest danger to the public"". That is, in summary form, the substance of the judge's sentencing remarks. She imposed a sentence of life imprisonment in relation to each offence. The minimum term was nine years less time spent on remand. She identified the notional terms in relation to the individual offences as 18 years in respect of the attack on Kirk, and six and eight years in relation to the offences against the new partner. It would appear though that the overall sentence must have been aggregated to reflect all offending. 9 Returning to the injuries sustained by Kirk, they were life threatening and life changing. She was transferred from a hospital in Weston to a specialist intensive care unit in Bristol where she remained for three-and-a-half weeks. She had significant external burns on 35 per cent of her body, including face, neck, chest, hands, torso, upper thighs and buttocks. The burns meant that she was unrecognisable. She had severe inhalation injuries. Her mouth, respiratory tract and lungs were burned. Her vocal chords were left in a fixed and closed position. After two weeks, a tracheostomy was inserted. This allowed her to continue breathing unassisted but it by-passed her vocal chords. She did eventually learn how to speak but only very softly and with difficulty. The tracheostomy remained in place until her death. Kirk was in hospital altogether for eight-and-a-half months after the injuries were inflicted, during which time she underwent 14 operations. 10 Kirk had a son and a daughter. In 1998 the son was aged 22 and the daughter was aged 13. Both made victim personal statements after Kirk died. They described the horror of seeing their mother in hospital in the aftermath of the attack. They said their mother was in constant pain with itching from the scarring being particularly troublesome. Eating was a struggle. Their mother slept badly and suffered nightmares. She was frequently depressed. Nonetheless, she had made a life for herself despite the effects of the injuries. She did have to go to hospital on many occasions, particularly when she suffered a chest infection. 11 In August 2019, Kirk was admitted to hospital. She was seriously ill. Her intestines were swelling and herniated. As a result, pressure was being placed on her diaphragm. Had she been fit for surgery, it would have been possible to relieve the pressure; she was not, because of the injuries she suffered in 1998. Because her chest and abdomen were not able to expand, the diaphragm was fatally ruptured. On 23 August 2019, Kirk died. 12 Craig was charged with murder, the date of the offence on the indictment being identified as 23 August 2019. He was tried in the Crown Court at Bristol. The only issue for the jury was whether the injuries inflicted by him in April 1998 played a significant part in Kirk's death. The prosecution alleged that the injuries were causative in two respects. First, the scarring meant that the chest and abdomen were not able to expand; second, surgery could not be undertaken because of the risks inherent in somebody of Kirk's condition. The prosecution case was accepted and Craig was convicted of murder. 13 On 10 November 2022, Craig was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a minimum term of 15 years and five days. The judge concluded that the appropriate minimum term by reference to Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Code would have been 34 years. She deducted all of the time spent in custody in relation to the offence of causing grievous bodily harm of which Craig was convicted in 2000, namely the time on remand prior to that conviction and the entirety of the period in custody thereafter, including periods after the expiry of the minimum term when the Parole Board considered it not safe to release Craig or when Craig would have been recalled. That total period was just short of 19 years. 14 Craig now appeals his sentence with the leave of the single judge. He has three grounds of appeal. First, that the judge should not have applied Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Code because the true date of the commission of the offence for sentencing purposes was 18 April 1998, i.e., when the injuries were inflicted. Thus, the transitional provisions in paragraph 12 of Schedule 21 should have applied and the appropriate minimum term should have been set by reference to the practice followed by the Secretary of State in 2002. That would have led to a minimum term of somewhere between 15 and 20 years. Second, if and in so far as Schedule 21 did apply, the judge erred when she concluded that the seriousness of the offence was particularly high so as to give a starting point of 30 years. Third, even if it were appropriate to use the starting point of 30 years, there were no matters justifying increasing that starting point to 34 years. 15 We deal first with the issue of the date of the offence. The judge provided a written ruling on that issue. She had written submissions from the parties. She noted that the purpose of these transitional provisions in Schedule 21 was to avoid the imposition of a sentence which offended Article 7.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights which prohibits the imposition of a heavier penalty than one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed. 16 In argument, the defence had relied on R v Wright and Hennessy [2022] EWCA Crim 68 as authority for the proposition that the offence of murder may be complete when the causative act is committed. In that case, the trial judge had sentenced on that basis. The judge noted that it was not an issue on the appeal as to whether the trial judge's approach was correct. On the facts of the case the transitional provisions did not apply, the injuries being caused in 2006, namely well after the Criminal Justice Act 2003 had come into force. The approach taken by the judge was intended to reflect the youth of the appellants in that case at the time of the original infliction of the injuries. Thus, so found the judge, Wright and Hennessy provided no support for the defence argument. 17 The judge concluded that an essential element of the offence of murder was the death of the victim. The definition of murder requires the offender to have unlawfully killed the victim with intent to kill or to cause really serious harm. Unless and until the victim had died, there can have been no unlawful killing. Thus, Kirk was murdered on 23 August 2019. The passage of time between the unlawful act and the death may give rise to circumstances highly relevant to an offender's culpability and to factors aggravating or mitigating the offence. By that route, the court can adjust the starting point in so far as is necessary to ensure there is no injustice to an offender. The judge gave the obvious example of where the offender was particularly young at the time of the unlawful act. 18 We are quite satisfied the judge was correct in her ruling. The view taken by the trial judge in Wright and Hennessy was noted by this Court on appeal. It was not the subject of any argument. The Court did not discuss the issue of the date of the commission of the offence, whether for sentencing purposes or otherwise. It was of academic interest given the facts of the case. In our view, an offence cannot be committed until all elements thereof have been proved. Until 23 August 2019 the prosecution could not prove that Kirk had been killed. Until that date the appellant could not have been charged with murder. It was only when he was charged with murder that he could be sentenced for that offence. 19 The grounds of appeal stated that he had been sentenced more harshly than when he commenced the chain of causation which led to death. Even if that were correct, it would be of no consequence. The relevant point is when the offence was committed. The judge's ruling did not offend Article 7.1 of the Convention. Sentencing the appellant by reference to the current sentencing regime did not offend Article 7.1. 20 The second and third grounds require us to consider the judge's reasoning which led her to conclude that without any deduction of time spent in custody hitherto the appropriate minimum term was 34 years. The judge concluded that the starting point should be 30 years. The factors which led her to conclude that the seriousness of the offence was particularly high were as follows: the planned and premeditated nature of the attack; the sadistic nature of the appellant's conduct in the build-up to the attack; the appellant's awareness of the level of seriousness involved in his use of petrol. She considered the case of R v Dunstan [2016] EWCA Crim 2098 which had been referred to in the course of argument. She rejected any suggestion that that case provided support for the proposition that the appropriate starting point should be 25 years. She concluded that Dunstan was distinguishable on its facts. 21 The judge found that thereafter there were aggravating factors. First, and most significant, she identified the pattern of violence by the appellant towards Kirk which had increased over time. The appellant in a chilling way had forced her into submission over a course of months and years. Kirk was vulnerable. The appellant's behaviour was an abuse of trust. The judge, in making those observations, clearly had well in mind the overarching principles in relation to domestic abuse issued by the Sentencing Council and effective from 24 May 2018. Second, the appellant was drunk when he committed the offence. Third, the appellant's actions after he had set fire to Kirk were cowardly; he had done nothing to help her. 22 The judge went on to refer to two further aggravating factors. First, the appellant's actions involved a high level of sadism. The nature of the attack was extreme. Second, Kirk endured physical and mental suffering for 21 years, and the impact on her family over the same period had been substantial. Those various aggravating factors served to increase the minimum term to 35½ years. 23 The judge then turned to personal mitigation. She said that his behaviour from 2000 to the date of death did not assist him. The passage of time had not led him to make the most of himself. The Parole Board had not considered him safe for release until 2015. Within three years his behaviour whilst on licence had led to his recall to prison. She said that little weight could be given otherwise to the passage of time that had elapsed since the appellant had inflicted the injuries given the effect on Kirk and her family over that period. The judge accepted that there had been no intention to kill. However, she said that this had ""reduced significance, almost to vanishing point, because of the risk of her dying from what the appellant did was so obvious even if it was not his intention"". She said she gave some weight to the fact that the appellant had a sense of disappointment at being subject to further incarceration for what he had done in 1998. 24 The judge reduced the minimum term by 18 months to take account of personal mitigation thereby reducing that to 34 years. The judge considered that justice required that the minimum term to be imposed for the offence of murder should be reduced by the total time that the appellant had already spent in custody. The appellant's previous sentence was based on identical facts. Reduction was to take into account the time the appellant had spent on remand prior to the trial in 2000 and all the time that he had been detained pursuant to that sentence in 2000, including periods of recall. So it was that 18 years 11 months and 25 days was deducted from the period of 34 years, giving a minimum term of 15 years and five days. 25 Mr Tehrani KC argued that the judge had erred in setting the starting point of the minimum term at 30 years; the starting point should be reserved for the most serious of cases of which this case was not one. His submission to us was that the court in 2000, when setting a specified period of nine years' imprisonment in relation to the three life sentences, must already have taken account of the matters that placed this case in the category of particularly serious offending.

This would involve a minimum term reflecting simply the fact of death and the deceased's pain and suffering prior to death. Paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 21 reads as follows: ""3(1) If - (a) the case does not fall within paragraph 2(1) but the court considers that the seriousness of the offence ... is particularly high, and (b) the offender was aged 18 or over when the offence was committed, the appropriate starting point, in determining the minimum term, is 30 years."" Paragraph 3(2) of the Schedule gives examples of cases that would normally fall within paragraph 3(1). The list of examples is not exhaustive. It is for the court in any particular case to assess whether the facts and circumstances render the seriousness of the offence particularly high. 26 In Dunstan , to which we have already referred, this court took the view that where the offender had spontaneously poured white spirit on a woman with whom he was staying and set fire to her the case did not fall within paragraph 3(1). It distinguished the line of cases commencing with R v Jones [2005] EWCA Crim 3315 which indicate that a 30-year starting point is appropriate where there has been a deliberate and planned arson attack on a house. The court concluded in Dunstan that the starting point should have been 15 years though the many aggravating features served to increase the starting point to 25 years. However, the court said at [24]: ""That is not to say that there will not be cases where death is caused by deliberate arson in circumstances similar to the facts of this case which will properly be described as being particularly serious for the purposes of Schedule 21 ...

Her fact-sensitive assessment cannot be criticised. The circumstances and facts in this case were very different to those in Dunstan . 28 We reject the submission made by Mr Tehrani as to what the judge's task was when sentencing the appellant in 2022. The judge had to sentence the appellant for the offence of murder. The fact that another judge in 2000 imposed a sentence when the appellant was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm was of relevance to her overall assessment of the appropriate sentence, that is after she determined the correct minimum term for the offence of murder. That sentence was not to be used when considering the appropriate sentence for the offence for which this judge had to sentence the appellant in 2022. 29 The third ground of appeal is that the judge fell into the trap of double counting when increasing the minimum term to take account of aggravating factors. In writing, Mr Tehrani argued that matters taken into account by the judge must have been taken into account by the judge who sentenced the appellant in 2000 for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Thus, the judge should not have taken them into account in 2022. We reject that argument. We reiterate the appellant was being sentenced for the offence of murder. All of the factors relevant to the commission of that offence had to be taken into account by the judge. The fact that they may have been considered at the time of the earlier sentence was irrelevant to the judge's assessment of the case. The consequences of the earlier conviction and sentence properly were reflected in the adjustment of the minimum term after the starting point had been identified and adjusted to take account of aggravating and mitigating factors. 30 We should say that it is not at all clear the extent to which the judge in 2000 took into account, for instance, the domestic abuse of which the setting fire to Kirk was the culmination. Her sentencing remarks were brief. They concentrated on the horrific nature of the offence and on the danger presented by the appellant. This is a practical example of why it would not be appropriate in any case of murder to discount factors which may have been taken into account at an earlier sentencing exercise for a different offence. 31 In oral argument, Mr Tehrani also submitted that the aggravating factors identified by the judge were what had led her to the minimum term of 30 years and, therefore, should not further increase the custodial term. 32 We disagree. Her analysis related, first, to the particular circumstances of the offence and then, quite separately, a detailed recitation of the aggravating factors with particular reference to the element of domestic abuse. The judge is criticised for giving insufficient weight to the mitigating factors. It is said she identified the relevant factors but either discounted them altogether or did not give them the weight they deserved. This was a matter for the judgment of the trial judge. She was fully seized of the mitigating factors being advanced. We would have to conclude that the judge was wrong in her assessment in order to interfere. We do not and cannot reach that conclusion. If anything, we consider that the judge may have been generous to the appellant. 33 This was a horrifying and cruel attack on a defenceless woman by a controlling man. The circumstances of the attack justified the starting point of 30 years. The background of domestic abuse made the offence particularly serious. A substantial uplift from the starting point was justified. The uplift chosen by the judge cannot be described as manifestly excessive. Proper account was taken of such mitigation there was. It follows that we reject the argument that the minimum term imposed was manifestly excessive. 34 The appellant's minimum term of 15 years and five days was calculated, as we have said, by reference to all of the time he spent in custody up to the date of sentence. That overall reduction was not something to which he was entitled by statute. References in section 240ZA and section 241 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to credit the time served relate to periods of custody pursuant to a court order, namely a remand order or an order committing an offender to custody. Once the minimum term imposed in 2000 had expired, the appellant was being held until the Parole Board considered it safe to release him. From that point on he was not being held pursuant to a court order. When he was recalled to prison that was also not pursuant to a court order. 35 The judge had a discretion to go beyond the statutory regime if she was satisfied that the circumstances were exceptional: see Wright and Hennessy at [29]. That is the view she took. Self-evidently, it is not something we are asked to review now. However, we observe that the appellant may consider himself fortunate that the judge exercised her discretion to the extent she did. First, the sentence imposed in 2000 was not solely in respect of the facts which related to the fatal attack. The appellant was also sentenced in respect of quite separate offending in relation to a different victim. In so far as the overall sentence was affected by that separate offending, admittedly difficult to identify from the sentencing remarks in 2000, that part of the sentence should have had no part to play in reducing the minimum term. 36 Second, unlike the appellants in Wright and Hennessy , the appellant had not just been detained pending the Parole Board's satisfaction that it was safe to release him. He had also been recalled to prison after his initial release and prior to any recall following the death of Kirk. Whether justice required that period to be credited to him, is, in our view, arguable. In any event, the upshot is that the appellant was given full credit for all time spent in custody. That was to his advantage. It further underlines that the sentence imposed on him in 2022 was not manifestly excessive. Taking into account all the matters we have rehearsed, we dismiss this appeal. __________"

On 7th July 1997 the Full Court gave leave to appeal against conviction in relation to two of the offences, namely attempted murder and murder, and adjourned the renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence to this court. Synopsis of Prosecution Case at Trial The appellant was born in Pakistan on 28th February 1952 and married there. She came to England when she was twenty years old, and settled in Bradford, West Yorkshire, where she had three children, Naseem (born 13th November 1973), Amrez (born 5th January 1978) and Fozia (born 19th July 1980). She also had two other children who died very young. When she was pregnant with Fozia her husband left her for another younger woman, and by February 1983 she and her children were living in a rented terraced house at 251 Legrams Lane, Bradford. The house was purchased in July 1983 by Mohammed Salim Azam for £11,000. He was a married man, well-known to the appellant, and it has always been her case, not seriously disputed by the prosecution, that he simply lent his name to the transaction. She provided the deposit of £2000 which she borrowed in whole or in part from ""the committee"" - an Asian Community organisation - and a mortgage was obtained from the Halifax Building Society. It was common ground that she paid the mortgage instalments as they fell due, using housing benefit, which she claimed, for that purpose. It was the prosecution case at the trial that the common thread running through all of the counts in the indictment was the appellant's increasingly desperate attempts to secure from Azam and to retain the title to 251 Legrams Lane. In April 1984 Azam was arrested for serious offences connected with drugs, and in October 1984 he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The appellant gave evidence at his trial. That sentence was later reduced to eight years, and he was released in May 1989. Whilst Azam was in prison the appellant began an association with Raghib Shah, another married man, and in September 1988 Raghib, with the co-operation of the appellant, put himself forward to the Halifax Building Society as a potential purchaser of 251 Legrams Lane. He sought and was offered a mortgage, and the Building Society paid to Azam £620 retained from the original advance. That payment was diverted into the appellant's account, but the proposed purchase by Raghib did not proceed because by January 1989 questions had been raised as to the authenticity of a power of attorney, apparently signed by Azam, pursuant to which the appellant was acting when offering the property for sale. Shortly before he was released from prison in May 1989 Azam wrote two letters to the appellant pointing out that she had not paid any rent for 251 Legrams Lane, and seeking possession. But he does not seem to have taken any action to enforce that request in the months after he was released. The appellant then began her second attempt to obtain title to 251 Legrams Lane. In February 1990 the appellant and Raghib went to Mr Conway of Conway Musson and Co, a solicitor whom they did not know. Raghib pretended to be Azam, the legal owner of 251 Legrams Lane, and said that he was returning to Pakistan and he wanted to redeem the mortgage and sell the property. The redemption figure given by the Halifax Building Society at that stage was £9638.62, and on 5th March 1990 the appellant went back with Raghib to Mr Conway's office, where they gave to the solicitor £3966.47 in cash, a cheque for £4106.40 drawn on the appellant's account, and a cheque for £1700 drawn on Raghib's wife's account. They both also signed the transfer documents, and by doing so committed the forgery referred to in count 1 in the indictment. It was said that if Azam found out what had happened to the title of 251 Legrams Lane there was likely to be trouble, and it was the prosecution case in support of count 3 on the indictment that on or about 14th March 1990 the appellant sought out Mir Aslam (otherwise known as Bala), a man who had a bad local reputation, and asked him to kill Azam for money. Bala, who had met Azam in prison, reported the proposal to Azam, and was equipped with a tape recorder when he next negotiated with the appellant. She paid over £2000 and some valuable bangles so that the deed could be done, but of course at that stage nothing was done. Azam complained to the police, and the appellant also complained to the police, alleging that Azam had made threats and caused damage to her property. She also instructed new solicitors to seek legal aid to sue Azam, and paid an expedition fee to expedite registration of the title to 251. On 28th March 1990 the appellant was arrested and interviewed, and on that occasion she asserted that Azam had transferred the property to her. She said that he had asked Bala to kill her, and paid him £3000 to do so. She said that Bala had raped her and stolen 6 bangles worth £1300 as well as £200 in money. She denied that she had ever asked Bala to kill Azam, and said that what she said on the tape had been said piecemeal in her own home at the dictation of Bala after she had been reduced to tears. At the trial there was expert evidence called by the prosecution to show that the tape recording had not come into existence piecemeal in the way that she had alleged, and that it had probably been recorded, as Bala alleged, in a taxi or hire car. On the day that the appellant was being interviewed, 28th March 1990, solicitors acting for Azam issued a notice to quit alleging rental arrears of £3000, and it is perhaps not surprising that at that stage the police and the prosecuting authorities decided to opt out, and to leave the dispute to the civil courts. On 29th March 1990 the appellant, Azam and Bala were all bound over, but things seem to have continued much as before. On 2nd April 1990 a Halifax Building Society cheque refunding insurance to Azam in the sum of £78.13 was endorsed by someone other than Azam and was paid into the appellant's bank account. On 23rd April 1990 the Building Society confirmed to Azam's solicitors they no longer had the title deeds to number 251 because the account had been repaid, and in May 1990 those solicitors registered a caution on the title and reported the situation to the police. Sometime during May 1990 the appellant went to Pakistan for the wedding of her eldest daughter Naseem, and whilst she was away she heard that windows had been broken at the rear of number 251. She returned to England, and on 11th August 1990 she was interviewed by the police as to how she had obtained the title to number 251. She said then that she had paid the deposit of £2000 and the instalments and that it was Azam who had gone the solicitors, that is to say to Mr Conway, to pay off the mortgage with money she had obtained from relatives. She had not gone, she said, because she was looking after a young handicapped child. On some uncertain date after the appellant's attempt in March 1990 to get Bala to kill Azam there was an occasion when the appellant and Azam were driven to Luton by Fawad Alam, a friend of Azam. According to Fawad the appellant jumped in front of the car as they were setting off and waved them down. During that journey Fawad observed Azam and the appellant kissing in the back of the car, and he says that Azam asked the appellant why she had got Bala to kill him, adding ""you could easily have poisoned me."" By late February 1992 although the appellant and Azam were often seen in each others company they were also litigating in the civil courts. The appellant had sued both Bala and Azam, and on 25th February 1992 her solicitors wrote to Azam's solicitors, saying that the appellant had informed them that ""the two families are now speaking again and that there appears to be some measure of agreement between them."" The letter continues :- ""We understand it is suggested that this action be concluded with our client making no further claims against your client and your client withdrawing his claims against our client's property so that the net result would be that the damages action against your client would cease but that your client would accept our client's title to the property. ......."". Azam's solicitors replied immediately indicating that according to their client there had been no discussion along the lines suggested, and on 29th February 1992, when Azam visited number 251, the appellant, with the apparent intention of killing him, gave him food laced with arsenic. So count 4 in the indictment charged her with attempted murder. Azam was very ill, but in due course he was discharged from hospital and continued his association with the appellant. At that stage he apparently did not appreciate that she had attempted to poison him. On 6th March 1992 the appellant's solicitors, having heard formally from Azam's solicitors in relation to the alleged proposal to settle the civil action, wrote to the appellant as follows :- ""The solicitors to Mr Azam have written to say that he denies entering into any agreement with you and that the case must proceed. I will let you know when the pressure next arrives to make some progress with the case. I presume until then you would wish me to allow the matters to rest."" It was the prosecution case that having failed to remove the threat to her title to number 251 by means of an agreement the appellant resorted again to arsenic, and on 10th April 1992 at her home she laced Azam's food with a fatal dose, hence the charge of murder which was count 5 in the indictment. There was evidence that about 3.0 am next morning, when he was very ill, Azam told his wife that he had eaten gagrella at Zoora's and there was also evidence that the appellant tried to persuade Azam's sister not to agree to the hospital conducting the post mortem examination which took place on 13th April 1992, but which yielded no significant result. Azam was therefore buried, but soon afterwards his vomit was analysed, as a result of which his body was exhumed. The presence of arsenic was firmly established, and on 17th April 1992 the appellant was arrested. She was interviewed many times, but constantly denied any wrongdoing, and chose not to give evidence at her trial. The Defence Case at Trial Although the appellant did not give evidence she did not simply put the prosecution to proof. She was represented by Mr Murdoch of T.I. Clough & Co., an experienced criminal defence solicitor who gave evidence before us, and who, with the assistance of an interpreter, took detailed instructions. Those instructions were conveyed to Mr James Stewart Q.C. and Mr Andrew Campbell, and throughout the hearing of this appeal Mr Edward Fitzgerald, Q.C. , who now appears for the appellant, has accepted, in our judgment rightly, that the appellant was competently represented in the court below. For reasons which will become apparent it is of some significance to see what the defence was which was advanced, and we know what it was because we have a full transcript of Mr Stewart's final speech. Dealing with the matter chronologically, Mr Stewart submitted that Azam, at least at times, abused the appellant's trust in relation to the house at Legram's Lane for which she had paid everything by asserting that his interest in the house was more than nominal. Nevertheless Mr Stewart contended that this cause of friction between the appellant and Azam was not such a central feature of the case as the prosecution alleged. Between 1984 and 1989, when Azam was in prison, the appellant did form a close relationship with Raghib, and in 1988 when she wanted to go to Pakistan to see her sick father she did want to sell the house to Raghib to raise money for the journey, thinking that she would buy the house back on her return, but she did not forge Azam's signature on the power of Attorney, nor did she know who did so, even though she falsely told the police that the document was signed by Azam in his wife's presence. Similarly she did not endorse Azam's signature on the back of the cheque for £620 before it was paid into her account. As Mr Stewart put it ""someone forged it; it was not Zoora"". The proposed sale to Raghib in 1988 did not proceed, not because of any difficulty with the Power of Attorney, but because the appellant's father recovered, and she no longer needed to raise money to go to Pakistan. In March 1989, before Azam was released from prison, he became aware of and jealous of her affair with Raghib. In a letter to the appellant of 13th March 1989 Azam asserted that the appellant was using ""my property"" in an immoral way and he threatened to refer them to the authorities. Another letter of 18th April 1989, is in similar vein, so it was contended on the appellant's behalf that the 1989 letters claiming non-payment of rent and misuse of the £620 cheque should not be taken at face value. Azam and the appellant both knew perfectly well that no rent was due and that the £620 was money to which the appellant was entitled. After Azam was released from prison in May 1989 the defence contention was that he and the appellant were reconciled. To quote Mr Stewart again ""they forgave each other; they became friends again, which is what Zoora said to the police and, you may think, is borne out by other evidence."" In 1990 the appellant once again wanted to raise money to go to Pakistan, and once again the solution appeared to be the sale of 251 to Raghib. Her relations with Azam were good, he recognised that in reality the house was hers, and was happy for it to be transferred to her so she could raise money by means of a sale to Raghib. That was what she told the police, and Mr Stewart relied on that assertion. So the new solicitor, Mr Conway, was visited by a man and a woman on 26th February and 5th March 1990. But the appellant was not there on either occasion. The records kept for her by her daughter Naseem were relied on to show that on each occasion she was looking after someone who was disabled . Thus, it was contended, she could have had no part in forging the transfer document which is referred to in count 1. The incitement to murder alleged in count 3 was entirely attributable to mischief making by Bala. When the appellant's relationship with Azam was good Bala intervened and told Azam that the appellant wanted him killed. He then told the appellant that Azam wanted to kill her. Mr Stewart poured scorn on the suggestion that the appellant had given Bala £2000 and some valuable bangles to do the deed. Those to whom Bala said that he had passed on the bangles and some of the money were criticised because they had no documentary evidence to support what they said, and the authenticity of the tape-recording was questioned, largely on the basis that the police and the expert had only been furnished with a copy. In the period of disturbed relationships allegedly brought about by Bala, Fawad Alam gave evidence that he went with Azam to break the windows of number 251. According to Fawad, Azam added to the damage by breaking a television and a fishbowl, and this was of course the time when Azam's solicitors served the Notice to Quit. But at the trial Azam's wife said that within months of the Bala incident the appellant and Azam were friends again. Naseem also said that they took up again, and that was the case put by Mr Stewart to the jury. In 1991 Azam was visiting number 251 regularly and eating there, the appellant's mother was working for him in the nappy business, and he was regarded by the appellant's children as an uncle. When giving evidence Naseem said ""we were like his children. I was closer to him than a daughter would be."" The only person who, Mr Stewart suggested, was likely to have been unhappy with the arrangement was Azam's wife because Azam ""was shaming her by flaunting his relationship with another woman in public."" It was the defence contention that in the spring of 1992 the civil action brought by the appellant for damages and Azam's counter claim asserting his title to number 251 was all but over. Naseem gave evidence at the trial that ""at the time of Azam's death, as far as I knew, the action was being withdrawn. I heard this from Azam. He was saying this about 2 weeks before his death."" So the suggestion was that the letters written by Azam's solicitors did not really represent his intentions as disclosed by what he was saying to the appellant and her family. It was accepted that on the evening of 29th February 1992, after a visit to number 251, Azam was very ill, but Mr Stewart submitted that arsenic may not have been the cause. He developed that submission by reference to a body of medical evidence. The symptoms may have been attributable to severe gastro-enteritis and neuritis arising from diabetes. If they were attributable to a deliberate administration of arsenic then the jury was asked to consider whether the appellant was shown to have been the administrator. Mr Stewart conceded at the start of his address that if arsenic were deliberately administered ""you may think the probability is that whoever did it intended to murder him."" As to the events of 10th April 1992 Mr Stewart relied on the family evidence that ""Azam was not even expected that night"", and that in a house filled with relations there was no gagrella in sight and no opportunity for the appellant to administer arsenic, whether with gagrella or with anything else, because the food was taken from a communal dish. The possibility was raised that Azam may have been poisoned after he got home, and the jury was invited to look carefully at Ajaib's evidence that he told her that he had eaten ""some gagrella from Zoora's"". Was that said, or was Ajaib just wanting to implicate the appellant? If it was said, was Azam by then confused? We have gone into the defence case in some detail to show that there was nothing superficial about the case which was presented during the course of what Mr Stewart described to the jury, no doubt with a touch of flattery, as ""the fairest of trials"". In response to the case advanced by the prosecution a positive defence case was put forward, built upon evidence which was extracted from the appellant's family and other members of the Asian community. The appellant's daughter Naseem was an important witness, and of her, Mr Stewart said ""You saw Naseem. You judge her"". In relation to the title to the house Mr Stewart submitted that the appellant had no reason to resort to dishonesty or violence because ""she knew how to go to solicitors"" and on more than one occasion he pointed to her good character, her personality and her medical history to show that she was no murderess. Quite early on he said :- ""She is a woman described by her doctor as thin at the time, malnourished, rather highly strung, susceptible to periodic kidney infections, anaemia and depressions. Does she sound to you like a murderess, members of the jury?"" Later on, when dealing with the allegation of incitement to murder, Mr Stewart said :- ""What you are going to have to do is to ask yourselves whether it is conceivable that this mother of three children, who is one of life's losers you may think, who is described by her GP as highly strung and subject to depression, could conceivably go to a man like Mir Aslam and offer to pay him £2000 to kill somebody else."" The background to those submissions is of some importance, and that is a matter to which we now turn. Medical Evidence available at Trial On 29th July 1992, six days after the appellant had been re-arrested and charged with murder, she was examined by Dr Wood a consultant psychiatrist instructed by her solicitors. She had already been seen at length by Dr Singh of the medical staff of HMP Newhall, and Dr Wood was accompanied by Daljit Kaur, a representative of the appellant's solicitors, who translated to and from Punjabi. Dr Wood did not have access to the GP notes or hospital notes, but he learnt from the appellant that she had not previously been seen by a psychiatrist although she had taken too many pills on two occasions, the most recent being eight years previously. She said that she had been beaten by her husband, but felt badly let down and disgraced by his leaving her. Dr Wood got the impression that she might well have had a succession of men friends thereafter, but she denied that, although she said that she had called the police when pestered by men and had attacked two men who had given her unwanted attention. Dr Wood also thought that she may have been anxious and depressed prior to the alleged offence of murder. At page 5 of his report he says :- ""My discussions of the current allegation of murder elicited straight forward denials from this accused. She was plainly aware of the nature and the seriousness of the charge that she is facing, but she told me that she had not committed any offence. She was prepared to give a very detailed account of the background to her acquaintance with the victim of this offence, and she was determined that she had not done anything to deserve to be charged with murder."" Dr Wood considered the risks if she were to be granted bail, and concluded :- ""It was plain on 29th July, 1992 that she was not suffering from a depressive illness."" On 7th October 1993 at the request of the court, another consultant psychiatrist Dr Paul Collins examined the appellant at Newhall. He had access to IQ tests and to her inmate medical record, which included photocopies of some GP records covering the six months prior to her remand in custody. He had also read the depositions, so he knew the case against her. Dr Collins obtained a medical history from the appellant who told him, amongst other things, that she had been to see her GP because of worry and depression, but she said that at the time of Azam's death ""she did not feel depressed, nor did she have any trouble sleeping, eating or with her general health."" She described her life as normal, but forcefully refused to answer questions relating to sexual matters which she said were of no relevance. Dr Collins found her presentation to be consistent with mild depression. His opinion was that with the aid of an interpreter she would be able to follow court proceedings and give instructions to her legal advisors. Dr Collins concluded :- ""Following her reception into custody there was some evidence of depression, which was probably reactive to the situation in which she found herself and which may persist to some extent still. From my interview and examination of Zoora Ghulam Shah and the other information available to me I am not of the opinion that at the material time she suffered from such an abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts or omissions in playing or being a party to the killing of the victim."" During the course of the trial the appellant's solicitors, on the advice of counsel, obtained a statement from the appellant's general practitioner Dr Mughal, which was read to the jury. She had only become his patient in February 1992, so his statement consists mainly of a review of her general practitioner records which showed depression or anxiety intermittently since early 1986, anaemia and kidney infections. Dr Mughal had himself observed her to be thin and malnourished, and rather highly strung. He said that no medicine prescribed for her would have caused her to become depressed. So the medical evidence at that time, as it seems to us, was all one way. It showed that the appellant had often sought medical assistance, that she had suffered to some extent from depression and anxiety, but there was no evidence that at the material time when Azam died she was suffering from such an abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired her responsibility for her acts. Furthermore when examined in custody she appreciated her position, she co-operated with the examiner, and was plainly so far as could be ascertained capable (with the assistance of an interpreter) of giving instructions to solicitors and counsel in the normal way. Developments after Sentence. On 23rd March Grounds of Appeal were settled by trial counsel in relation to the conviction on counts 4 and 5, and in relation to the sentence imposed on counts 1 and 3. On 2nd April 1994 leave to appeal was refused by the single judge. Thereafter the appellant instructed her present solicitors, and they instructed Pragna Patel, a part-time community worker with Southhall Black Sisters to visit the appellant. She did so on many occasions over a period of 18 months, and assisted the appellant to prepare a full statement which, together with the solicitors, Pragna Patel reduced to the 59 page statement which we have seen. We summarise what in that statement the appellant says :- (1) persistently over the years she had lied to the police, the doctors and to her lawyers. (2) her husband had been violent to her, yet when he left her she was worse off - stranded in a strange land, unable to speak English, and with young sick children. (3) having met Azam she decided to have sex with him in return for his help. In her statement she said at first she thought she loved him, but that was not her evidence in the witness box. Before Azam lent his name to the purchase of 251 Legram's Lane she knew that he was involved in drugs and kept weapons. She sought help from Raghib but he was afraid of Azam, and for what help he gave her he ""extracted a price"". She became pregnant by Azam and eventually had an abortion - it was one of several she had over the years. (4) in about October 1982 she went to Pakistan to see her father and was told by Azam to bring back drugs. He was angry when she did not do so. He took her to the cemetery where her children were buried, and there abused her verbally, physically and sexually. (5) in about 1983 she when pregnant took an overdose of tablets but vomited, recovered and eventually had an abortion. Even when she was weak and unwell Azam demanded sex. (6) on one occasion when the appellant was ill Azam threatened to turn his attention to Naseem, then aged about 10. (7) when Azam was arrested in April 1984 she visited him in prison, and Zamoorat (Azam's sister's husband) began to call on her. He and Raghib had keys, and both sexually abused her whilst Azam was in prison. Zamoorat and others claimed to do so with Azam's approval. (8) in 1986 Naseem was sent to Pakistan because of Azam's ""persistent interest"" in her. (9) the forgery of transfer documents in relation to 251 was Raghib's idea. he said that Azam would never give her the house but offered her money, which she needed to go to Pakistan, if she co-operated in getting the house transferred to his name. About £2000 of the £9638.62 paid to Mr Conway on 5th March 1990 to redeem the mortgage came from her own and Naseem's savings, the rest came from the committee and from Raghib. (10) when Azam came out of prison he threatened to evict her and leave her to Raghib. He also denied sending Zamoorat to her. In the result both Azam and Raghib continued to abuse her, and Azam expressed further interest in Naseem, who was then sent back to Pakistan. She appealed to Azam's brother Sher Azam an ""elder"" in the community but he declined to help. (11) because of Azam's treatment of her she did ask Bala to beat up Azam, to show that there was someone on her side. Bala said that as Azam was a very dangerous man she would then be in danger, and recommended that Azam be killed. After discussing the proposal with Raghib she agreed, and gave Bala money and jewellery. (12) after her attempt to hire Bala to kill Azam was discovered, Tariq , who she had met through Raghib, suggested that she say that she was raped. She knew Azam to be behind the damage done to her house and he and Fawad continued to harass her after the binding over. Damage was done to her home in May 1990 while she was in Pakistan for the wedding of Naseem. (13) whilst in Pakistan she obtained a taveez (writing on a piece of paper) from a holy man, intending to give it to Azam to get him to transfer the house to her name and to leave her alone. The taveez was to be administered by putting the paper in water until the ink dissolved and then getting Azam to drink the water. She also got Dr Sejad to give her something to affect Azam's legs and make him impotent. He gave her a green powder (Neela totha) and told her that a teaspoon would have the desired effect, but if she gave more Azam would die. (14) on return to England she did not use the powder, but still feared Azam's interest in Naseem despite Naseem's marriage, and early in 1992 she was afraid that he was interested in Fozia as well. So she arranged for Fozia to go with her mother to Pakistan. (15) on 29th February 1992 when she used the powder because of Azam's continuing harassment, she put some of it into a samosa mixture. She also used the taveez. She fed Naseem and Fozia first with unadulterated samosas and when Azam arrived gave him the four somosas made with the adulterated mixture. He insisted in sharing the last somosa with Naseem and Fozia, which the appellant could only watch helplessly, but when he left she gave them milk and got them to vomit. (16) after Azam recovered he behaved as before. The appellant was very exhausted, and on one occasion had to be admitted to hospital. On discharge Azam took her to his friend Akhtar's house, and despite discouragement from the appellant made sexual advances to her in the presence of Akhtar's girlfriend. (17) Azam was again talking about Fozia (now nearly 12) and was angry when the appellant said that she planned to send Fozia to Pakistan with her mother for 4 weeks. On 10th April 1992 Azam again took the appellant to the cemetery for sex and on the way back she got him to buy some gagrella. She got home about 4 pm and Azam then left. She knew he would return about 8 pm and before he did so she added about a full teaspoon of the green powder to the gagrella. There were a number of relatives in the house and when Azam returned she took him aside into the front room to ask him not to make a fuss about Fozia going to Pakistan. His price was that she have sexual intercourse with him. She agreed, and got him then to eat the gagrella. In her statement the appellant does not say that on 10th April she intended to kill Azam. She says that she wanted him to become so ill that he would not be able to touch her again, and, by inference, would be no threat to her daughters. Dr Lipsedge, a consultant psychiatrist at Guys Hospital in London who has particular experience of trans-cultural psychiatry, was then consulted. He saw the appellant on 22nd March 1997 with Pragna Patel at Durham Prison, and concluded that she was suffering from a mental disorder when she poisoned Azam. The disorder was, in his opinion, a severe depressive illness which developed as a reaction to Azam's behaviour towards her and her daughters, and it diminished her responsibility at the material time. Further statements were obtained from Dr Mughal and Naseem, and fresh grounds of appeal were prepared in relation to counts 4 and 5 which admit to the deliberate administration of poison but contend that - (a) in relation to the offence of attempted murder (count 4) there was no intent to kill, only an attempt to render Azam impotent and incapable of causing further physical harassment: (b) in relation to the offence of murder (count 5) when administering the laced gagrella the appellant ""was no longer concerned whether Azam lived or died"". The court was invited to receive the appellant's 59 page statement, and the report of Dr Lipsedge together with an addendum of 18th June 1997, and to conclude that a reasonable jury in the light of the fresh evidence would acquit the appellant of murder and convict her of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility: alternatively it would be assisted by the report to conclude that the Crown had failed to disprove provocation. Of course neither the issue of provocation nor the issue of diminished responsibility played any part in the trial, but in the light of the fresh evidence the convictions are said in the grounds of appeal to be unsafe and unsatisfactory. On 7th July 1997 the full court (differently constituted) gave leave to appeal, without deciding whether the evidence of any individual potential witness should be received. Statements continued to be taken, even after we began to hear the appeal, and we now have - (1) a wealth of psychiatric evidence, including not only the original reports of Dr Wood and Dr Collins and the report of Dr Lipsedge, but also further reports from Dr Collins and Dr Lipsedge and reports from Dr Shubsachs and Dr Rix (instructed by the Crown): (2) General Practitioner material, including records and statements of successive General Practitioners Dr Modi, Dr Abbasi and Dr Mughal: (3) Social services records: (4) Statements from a number of lay witnesses who observed the appellant's demeanour at the relevant time: (5) A statement from Mr Murdoch, the solicitor who acted for her. Conduct of this Appeal We agreed to hear some witnesses orally, and to look at the rest of the material without deciding pursuant to section 23 Criminal Appeals Act 1968, as amended, whether or not to receive the evidence. We therefore heard oral evidence from Dr Mughal, the appellant, Mr Murdoch and Dr Lipsedge. We also heard submissions on behalf of the appellant and on behalf of the Crown. Mr Fitzgerald for the appellant urges us to receive the fresh evidence and to allow the appeal on the basis that once the evidence is received it becomes clear that the appellant was suffering from a depressive illness and that the defence of diminished responsibility ""might well succeed and might well have succeeded at the trial if advanced on the present lines"" (to use the words of Lord Bingham CJ in Campbell (1997 1 Cr App R 199 ). The conviction is therefore said to be unsafe (see section 2(1)(a) of the 1968 Act as amended) and the appeal in relation to that count should be allowed. Mr Fitzgerald recognises that if the appeal is allowed the normal course is to order a re-trial, and he did not seek to persuade us to adopt any other course, but he submitted that as count 4 (attempted murder) is closely linked with count 5 the conviction in relation to count 4 should also be set aside and the order for a re-trial should apply to that count also, so that the appellant can deploy further evidence of lack of intent to kill. Mr Fitzgerald accepted that if he could not persuade us to order a re-trial to enable the appellant to raise the issue of diminished responsibility he could not on the evidence available achieve that result to raise the issue of provocation, but he reserved the right if a re-trial is ordered to raise that issue also. The Crown's primary submission is that the fresh evidence should not be received, and it is really common ground that without fresh evidence the appeal must fail. Alternatively Mr Smith contends that if the fresh evidence is received it can be seen on analysis to be of little weight as the experts on whom the appellant relies are themselves relying on what she has told them, and she is a witness whose evidence has been demonstrated to be not worthy of belief. To that Mr Fitzgerald replies that the experts have other sources of information and their evidence can survive even if, contrary to his submissions, her evidence is not believed. Should the fresh evidence be received? Section 23 of the 1968 Act, as amended, provides so far as relevant :- ""(1) For the purposes of this Part of this Act the Court of Appeal may, if they think it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice - (c) receive any evidence which was not adduced in the proceedings from which the appeal lies. (2) the Court of Appeal shall in considering whether to receive any evidence have regard in particular to - (a) whether the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief; (b) whether it appears to the Court that the evidence may afford any ground for allowing the appeal; (c) whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal; and (d) whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence in those proceedings."" We therefore have a discretion under subsection (1). In deciding how to exercise that discretion we must give primary consideration to what is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, but we must also pay particular regard to the four matters listed in subsection (2). We turn therefore to consider each of those four matters separately. (a) Capable of Belief? We consider first the appellant's own evidence. Making every possible allowance for the difficulty of giving evidence through an interpreter to English judges whose experience of Asian culture is bound to be limited, we have to say that we found the appellant to be a most unsatisfactory witness, and her evidence to be not capable of belief. For example she said when giving evidence in chief that at the very beginning of their sexual relationship, before she went to number 251, Azam raped her. In cross-examination she said he treated her with respect ""when we first bought the house"" (i.e. number 251). She professed, perhaps rightly, to care a great deal for her daughters, but if what she has told us is right she never warned Naseem to beware of Azam although she believed that he posed a threat to her, and she stood by on 29th February 1992 and watched both daughters eat part of the samosa which she knew to be poisoned. She was not prepared to admit that she got Naseem to lie for her at her trial, but if her evidence to us is correct Naseem's account of eating samosas bought at a shop which the appellant could not have tampered with, and her portrayal of a happy relationship between the appellant, her daughters and Azam right up to the time of his death must have been a lie. The whole theme of the appellant's evidence to us was that for years she was subjected to physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Azam, Raghib, Zamoorat, and others, yet no one seems to have noticed a single suspicious bruise (other than one black eye), nor does she seem to have shared with any one what she now says was the cause of her troubles. We appreciate that for someone from her background it may not have been easy to unburden herself, but she had many contacts - three successive general practitioners, all Asian; social services representatives to whom she did speak about intimate matters such as abortion, and who included two ladies from her own culture; hospital staff, police and solicitors. Furthermore, although plainly at times anxious, undernourished and depressed she was, according to her daughter, a ""strong-willed woman"", and there was clear evidence of that in what she did. She not only broke the windscreen of a car belonging to one man, but, as the history shows, she conspired to commit forgery, hired a hit man (Bala) and, when double crossed made allegations of rape and theft which she now admits to be false. If she was prepared to share problems with a holy man and Dr Sejad in Pakistan when the problems were themselves many miles away we cannot see what prevented her from sharing them with doctors, social workers and others in Bradford who shared her cultural background, especially when her own liberty was at stake. Of course it would not be easy to say that she was being persistently sexually abused, but when she eventually alleged abuse by Zamoorat it was on six or eight occasions in her statement, but on a hundred occasions to Dr Shubsachs. That degree of discrepancy makes it impossible to accept that either version is true. Part of the appellant's explanation for the lack of candour with solicitors after her arrest was that she was led by them to believe that the case against her was not strong, but in cross-examination she conceded that she had no such illusions by the time of the trial and, having heard from Mr Murdoch, we very much doubt whether she had any illusions long prior to that. More than once the appellant referred to the Koran. She said that she did not give evidence at her trial because she did not wish to take the oath and then tell lies, but she accepted that she did just that at Azam's trial in 1984, and if what she now says is right she did it again when she swore an affidavit in relation to her civil action. More generally by her own admission she has lied repeatedly in the past, and we are far from satisfied that she has ceased to do so in the account she puts forward now. For present purposes we accept that the other evidence now laid before us - from lay witnesses, general practitioners, social workers, a solicitor and two consultant psychiatrists - is capable of belief. As Lord Bingham CJ said in Steven Jones (1997) 1 Cr. App. R. 86 at 93 C :- ""The requirement in subsection 2(a) that the evidence should be capable of belief applies more aptly to factual evidence than to expert opinion, which may or may not be acceptable or persuasive but which is unlikely to be thought incapable of belief in any ordinary sense."" Dr Lipsedge and Dr Shubsachs both approached their task in the normal way. They took a history from the patient and then went on to apply their expertise on the assumption that the history was correct, which at that time coincided with their belief. If, as is now apparent to us, both doctors were misled, the question arises as to whether their opinions can survive. Mr Smith submits that they cannot, but the two psychiatrists, in late supplementary reports tendered after the appellant gave her evidence, say that their conclusions are adequately supported by evidence drawn from other sources - GP records, hospital records, social services records, lay witnesses' observations, etc. That seems to us to be a tenable position for the two psychiatrists to adopt, but it is undeniable that their views would have carried much more weight if in each case it were possible for us to regard the patient's history as reliable. As Dr Rix points out, the patient's history - her record of symptoms - is one of the pillars on which psychiatric diagnosis stands. If the conclusions of Dr Lipsedge, Dr Shubsachs and to some extent Dr Mughal were to be accepted at face value then a jury would find that at the time of the killing the appellant was suffering from a depressive illness - a major depressive episode. Up to a point Dr Rix agrees. He considers that the appellant did suffer from a depressive or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, but on 29th July 1992 (3½ months after the killing) Dr Wood said that it was plain that she was not suffering from a depressive illness although she may have been anxious and depressed prior to the offence occurring. Dr Collins, who has seen the appellant on two occasions, one of them shortly before her trial, says that ""deliberate fatal poisoning of adults is not compatible with significant clinical depression"". The force of that point is easily grasped by a non-medical mind especially where, as here, the poisoning is repeated. (b) Grounds for allowing the appeal? The defence relied upon is diminished responsibility, which is set out in section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957. So far as material, it provides :- (1) where a person kills .... another he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts ..... in doing... the killing. (2) on a charge of murder, it shall be for the defence to prove that the person charged is by virtue of this section not liable to be convicted of murder. ""Abnormality of mind"" means a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that a reasonable person would judge it to be abnormal ( Byrne (1960) 2 QB 396). If a jury were to accept without qualification the views of Dr Lipsedge and Dr Shubsachs as to the extent of the appellant's depressive illness at the time of the killing then it may well be that they would find that she suffered from abnormality of mind, but, as Dr Rix points out, it does not necessarily follow that because a depressive or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder is present there was an abnormality of mind - ""Whether or not a jury would have regarded it as amounting to an abnormality of mind, which such disorders are capable of being, would depend on how they appraised the various elements of the evidence."" Similar problems arise in relation to the next ingredient in the statutory defence. If there was an abnormality of mind it must have been such as substantially impaired the appellant's responsibility for what she did. In other words it must have been a real cause of the appellant's conduct in poisoning Azam. It need not have been the sole cause, but she must show that its effect was more than merely trivial ( Lloyd (1967 1 QB 175). Here again, as it seems to us, the evidence of Dr Lipsedge, Dr Shubsachs and Dr Mughal, if accepted, does provide the basis for such a finding, but there are three consultant psychiatrists who express a different point of view, including both of those who saw the appellant before her trial. (c) Admissibility If the issue of diminished responsibility had been raised at the trial the evidence now sought to be relied upon would have been admissible, subject to exclusion of hearsay from the medical evidence (See Bradshaw (1986) 82 Cr. App. R. 79). But it was held in Melville (1975) 62 Cr. App. R. 100 that when section 23 of the 1968 Act speaks of the evidence being ""admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal"" that ""means an issue which was raised below and is the subject of the appeal in this court"" (per Lord Widgery CJ at 104). The emphasis is ours. Although Melville was decided long before the 1968 Act was amended the words in question have not been changed. It follows that in our judgment the fresh evidence does not meet the criteria in section 23(2)(c). (d) Reasonable Explanation for failure to adduce We accept that in some cases where the issue of diminished responsibility is not raised at the trial the explanation may be found in the same medical condition which is said on appeal to furnish the appellant with a defence. For example, in the recent case of Borthwick 27th October 1997 unreported, this court considered the possibility that an appellant said to be a paranoid psychotic, may not have been able to give rational instructions as to the way in which his defence was to be run. But that is not this case. Here Mr Fitzgerald submits that the appellant put forward a defence which she now admits to have been a tissue of lies because she wished to protect herself and especially her family from further shame and the risk of violence. We heard evidence from the appellant and from Dr Lipsedge as to the importance of honour in the society from which the appellant springs, and as to the possibility of retaliatory violence. Up to a point that is evidence which we accept, but only up to a point because this appellant, as it seems to us, is an unusual woman. Her way of life had been such that there might not have been much left of her honour to salvage, and she was certainly capable of striking out on her own when she thought it advisable to do so, even if it might be thought to bring shame on her or to expose her to the risk of retaliation. The forgery executed to obtain title, and the false allegations of rape and theft made against Bala are but two examples of that. The nature of her defence at the trial which involved an open attack on Bala and others, and a thinly veiled suggestion that the deceased's own widow might have been responsible for his death is another example. So we find ourselves wholly unable to conclude that the appellant has put forward a reasonable explanation for what happened in the court below. If she had not chosen to lie about her role in administering the poison it seems likely that her solicitors would have gone back to Dr Wood for a further medical report, and it may be that evidence would then have been forthcoming which would have enabled the defence of diminished responsibility to be raised, but that, at this stage, must be a matter of speculation. Necessary or Expedient in the Interests of Justice? Having given careful consideration to the matters identified in section 23(2) to which we are required to have regard when deciding whether or not to receive fresh evidence we return now to the discretionary powers set out in section 23(1). We may receive the evidence if we consider it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to do so. In Steven Jones (supra) Lord Bingham CJ at 93A said of section 23 that it acknowledges in subsection 2(d) - ""The crucial obligation on a defendant in a criminal case to advance his whole defence and any evidence on which he relies before the trial jury. He is not entitled to hold evidence in reserve and then seek to introduce it on appeal following conviction. While failure to give a reasonable explanation for failure to adduce the evidence before the jury is not a bar to reception of the evidence on appeal, it is a matter which the court is obliged to consider in deciding whether to receive the evidence or not."" That was an echo of what was said by Lord Taylor CJ in Ahluwalia (1993) 96 Cr App R 133 at 142 - ""Ordinarily, of course, any available defences should be advanced at trial. Accordingly if medical evidence is available to support a plea of diminished responsibility it should be adduced at the trial. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that this court would require much persuasion to allow such a defence to be raised for the first time here if the option had been exercised at trial not to pursue it. Otherwise, as must be clear, defendants might be encouraged to run one defence at trial in the belief that if it fails this court would allow a different defence to be raised and give the defendant, in effect, two opportunities to run different defences. Nothing could be further from the truth. Likewise, if there is no evidence to support diminished responsibility at the time of the trial, this court would view any wholly retrospective medical evidence obtained long after the trial with considerable scepticism."" Mr Fitzgerald submits that even if a defendant puts forward a lying defence the interests of justice may require this court to permit him or her to put forward a different defence if persuasive evidence to support such a defence is available by the time that the case reaches the Court of Appeal. We recognise that in some situations that may be the case, but we see little room for the operation of such a principle in a case of murder where a defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility for the acts or omissions which caused the death. If his choice was forced upon him by his illness then of course the position is quite different, but in general no one is entitled to more than one trial, and that, in our judgment, is a principle which ought to apply in this case. Mr Fitzgerald invited our attention to other cases in which this court has considered the provisions of section 23 and received fresh evidence and sent the case back for re-trial, even though the appellant had put forward a lying defence at his trial. In Richardson 9th May 1991 unreported, that course was adopted, but only it would seem because of the problems which arose as a result of the case being handled by different divisions of this court, and it must always be borne in mind that the power in section 23(1) is discretionary. In Ahluwalia (supra) the appellant's responsibility for the acts which caused death was never in issue, and the evidence of diminished responsibility was available at the time of trial. When giving judgment Lord Taylor CJ said at 143 - ""It is unclear how this potentially important material came to be overlooked or was not further pursued at the time of trial."" In Arnold 7th February 1996 unreported, a case to which Mr Fitzgerald referred on more than one occasion, the appeal failed because no reasonable explanation was given for the failure to adduce evidence of diminished responsibility at the trial, and the court concluded that the new evidence, if received, would do nothing to show that the convictions were unsafe. So the decision in each of the cases relied upon turned on the particular facts of that case, and each case emphasizes the point that only in wholly exceptional circumstances will this court receive fresh evidence to enable a defence to be advanced which was not put forward at the trial. Leaving aside for the moment the one trial principle to which we have referred there are, as it seems to us, other reasons why in this case we should hesitate to exercise our discretion in favour of admitting the fresh evidence. The appellant's own evidence is, as we have said, not capable of belief. The medical evidence on which she seeks to rely came into existence long after the relevant time, it initially relied heavily on her account which we have found to be flawed, and it is at variance with the evidence of the other psychiatrists who have been involved in the case. That factor is not of course decisive but compare, for example, Binning 12th April 1996 unreported, where the fresh evidence was unchallenged. We recognise, of course, that in section 23(2)(b) the word used is ""may"" but we cannot treat this as a case in which had the evidence now sought to be relied upon been deployed at trial the defence of diminished responsibility would have been bound to succeed. For all of those reasons we have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to receive the further evidence in this case, and without that further evidence the appeal against conviction must fail. As Mr Fitzgerald recognised, if the appeal against conviction fails the application for leave to appeal against sentence ceases to be of any significance and it too will be dismissed. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: For the reasons set out in the judgment which has been handed down, this appeal is dismissed so far as conviction is concerned. The application for leave to appeal against sentence referred to this court is also dismissed. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, there is a proposed list of points for certification to the House of Lords. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have had the advantage of seeing those quickly, thank you. MR FITZGERALD: May I address you on this? Firstly I am seeking a certified point of law, and secondly leave to appeal. We do submit that, whatever your Lordships' view as to the leave to appeal, this judgment does raise and this case does raise points of law of general importance. The first of those, which we have identified as point 1, is that of the correct interpretation of section 23(2)(c). That is to say whether the issue must be one which was raised below as well as being raised in the grounds of appeal. My Lord, that issue is dealt with in your Lordships' judgment at page 25 and relies on the decision in Melville . So far as I and my learned friend can recall this was not a matter on which we addressed your Lordship on either side, but obviously we felt it was before the court. The position is this, that firstly we would submit, it is in a single sentence in Melville , that approach to the interpretation of similar words. It is our submission that if one looks at the exact words of section 23(2)(c), which are set out in your judgment at page 19, whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings on an issue which is the subject of the appeal. We submit that there is no reference there to the additional criteria and which was an issue below. It is true -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Nor was there in Melville , in the words which were then in play. MR FITZGERALD: The formulation is not identical, but even assuming it your Lordships are always able to reconsider a decision of the Court of Appeal where the relaxation of a previous interpretation goes in favour of a defendant or appellant. In any event this is a question of whether the House of Lords should have an opportunity of determining whether that is a correct interpretation and we submit in relation to that, firstly, that your Lordships would not be bound in any event by an interpretation if your Lordships found that it worked in justice. However, having adopted that interpretation, the issue is whether there is an important point for resolution by the House of Lords in relation to this interpretation. My Lords, the two points made are these: firstly, it is not there. The words in issue in the court below are not in the subsection. To read into a penal statute words which are not there to the disfavour of the defendants is, in our respectful submission, a big step to take. There is no necessity in reading in. Indeed evidence for that comes conclusively from the decision in Campbell where a different interpretation was adopted. I cannot say definitely that they considered the case of Melville on this point, although it was before them in the citation. My Lord, I have to accept that it is not clear that they had before them that particular passage in Campbell . However as evidence of how these words strike the Court of Appeal -- as their natural, ordinary meaning struck the Court of Appeal -- we say that the decision in Campbell adopts an approach which is quite different and far more generous to the defendant. We have set out the passage in the skeleton argument. It is plain that the evidence would have been admissible for proceedings on which the appeal lies on an issue of diminished responsibility which is subject of the appeal. So just taking the approach there of the Court of Appeal of Bingham LCJ, plainly it was not his view that there had to be an issue which had been raised in the court below. Your Lordships can see that at 204 where, having cited the modern formulation that: ""(2) the Court of Appeal shall, in considering whether to receive any evidence have regard in particular to -- ""(c) whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal."" The court applies that criteria at D: ""It is plain it is that evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue of (diminished responsibility) which is the subject of the appeal."" There is no doubt that in Campbell that diminished responsibility had not been an issue in the court below. The criteria were interpreted following exactly the words of the statute, adding nothing. In our submission the decision in Melville , which did add something which was not there and did so in a way which restricts the rights of the defendant, is in our submission one which is suspect, both because it offends the fundamental interpretation that you do with the ordinary and natural meaning of the words, and secondly because it is inconsistent with the approach taken by this court in the more recent case of Campbell . My Lord, those are the submissions we make. Of course we would submit that there is a point of law of public importance and that this needs to be resolved; whether the approach under section 23(2)(c) is that the issue must have been raised in the court below or whether in this case it is sufficient to say, as in Campbell , that it is an issue in the stipendiary Court of Appeal. If that issue had been raised in the court below it would have been admissible evidence in relation to it. It is our submission that 23(2)(c) is concerned with admissibility rather than whether the issue had been raised in the court below. The reasonable explanation deals with the question of whether the thing was raised in the court below. This is purely to ensure that the admissible test is satisfied. Those are the submissions we make on point 1. We say it is an important point. It needs resolution in the light of two or more Court of Appeal authorities as to the correct approach to its interpretation. It arises in the course of your Lordships' judgment and is part of the finding that your Lordships made. Therefore whatever is your Lordships' decision in relation to the appeal, and I appreciate that the normal course is to leave it to the House of Lords, there is a point of law of public importance and the door should not be closed to that issue being resolved. The second point we make is in relation to point 2. We say that that point arises from the passage at the bottom of page 27. May I say immediately that of course it is obviously a point of public importance where the balance is to be struck between the one trial principle that your Lordships have identified, and the principle that the most important consideration is whether there is evidence of a trial at issue which casts doubt on the safety of a conviction. We entirely accept that. That is an issue which has to be resolved. There are perhaps two approaches. One is to emphasise the one trial principle. The other is to emphasise, as the Court of Appeal did in Arnold , that the most important thing is whether an issue has been raised which goes to the safety of the conviction. However looking at your Lordships' formulation of the principle, it sets out the submission that even if a defendant puts forward a line of defence then the interests of justice may require this court to permit him or her to put forward a different defence, if persuasive evidence to support such a defence is available by the time the case reaches the Court of Appeal. The court then recognises that that might apply in some situations but took a restrictive view in relation to murder where the defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility. We see that -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: In relation to the facts of this case. This was a case of murder. It was not intended to put murder into a special category. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, that, forming a crucial part of the res desidendum, is almost inevitably going to lead to the formulation of the principle; the rightness of which would be for the House of Lords to decide. However once it is voluntary and not constrained by duress, the presumption is, in fact the rule is that there is little room for the operation of such a principle where a defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility for the acts of omissions which caused the death. In any subsequent case where the argument is put, as relied on in Arnold , what really matters is not whether the person has lied but whether there is evidence of unsafeness of conviction. In this part of the ratio we see the operation of such a principle in a case generally, not in this case, but in any case where a defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility for the acts or omissions that caused death. My Lord, it is not an untypical situation. This is not the only case in which it is likely to arise. Indeed there are cases before the Criminal Case Review Board which raise similar issues where perhaps the degree to which the medical disorder or handicap could be an issue. We say this is a point of fundamental importance. It is not an isolated case. It is not formulated in such a way to be confined to the facts of this case. Indeed, as we understand it, your Lordships are seeking to identify a point of public policy for use in the resolution of these issues. Except where your Lordships envisage an exception where the person is so disabled by mental illness that they do not really have a choice, we would submit that of course in that case you would have a reasonable explanation, and yet Parliament clearly contemplates, and even where you do not have a reasonable explanation, that there can be cases where any reasonable explanation is absent, such as being disabled by mental illness, nonetheless it may be permissible in the interests of justice to allow the new evidence. We do stress that the court's approach is of fundamental importance. The emphasis is different to that in the decision of your Lordships' court in Arnold where it was stated at 28E: ""It is thus possible for the Court of Appeal to receive fresh evidence after a defendant has deliberately not run a particular defence at trial and even where his predicament has arisen from his having told lies at an earlier stage."" Now that was in the context of a murder case and in the context of where there were lies going to participation in murder. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We do not say it is not possible. This is the difficulty. It is a balancing exercise to be carried out on the facts of every individual case. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, it is really -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We say it is going to be difficult. MR FITZGERALD: Yes, little room for the operation of such a principle and then how can the principle operate? MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: Only in very exceptional cases, as the judgment makes clear. MR FITZGERALD: But then the example given is one which that so disabled in mental illness, you have not deliberately taken the choice because you have been disabled. My Lord, that is the point. We do submit that it is not entirely clear about what the scope of the principle is because the appellant did not give evidence and her only evidence on the record is from police interviews. My Lord, we do submit that the scope of the one trial principle, which your Lordships have identified as an important and perhaps in this case a determinative principle, is something which raises a point of law and public interest. It may be difficult to formulate the precise point of law. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am inclined to agree with you. MR FITZGERALD: That does not mean there is not an issue of -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We can only certify if there is a point of law which we can identify. I think your difficulty is that we are in the area where there is going to be a question of judgment and discretion in this court. MR FITZGERALD: I accept that, my Lord, but if one looks at what happens in the House of Lords very often the question is a very open-ended one, such as what is the scope of the one trial principle? One does not have to define it in so limited a way that it determines the ratio of the case, but we say there is here -- obviously your Lordships know better than I do what was the ratio of the case because you decided it -- if one looks at that sentence: ""We recognise that in some situations that may be the case, but we see little room for the operation of such principle in a case of murder where a defendant has freely chosen ..."" Given how it goes on, it is likely to be presented as a ratio where someone deliberately chooses to deny responsibility, save in situations of duress or medical disorder, that the principle that lies should not stand in the way of raising the unsafeness of the conviction. That is a general principle. My Lord, that is the submission I make in relation to point 2. Point 3, formulated in manuscript, is the crucial question in determining the exercise of discretion under section 23 ""whether the proffered evidence may afford ground for ..."" My Lord, that is quoted directly from the Arnold decision. Your Lordships have obviously seen that, but it is at 23H to 24A, where having decided the reasonable explanation test, the court said that the crucial question is whether it affords a ground for allowing the appeal. We submit that there is a tension between the approach, does it afford a ground for allowing the appeal, and the one trial principle approach which must be applied, save in exceptional circumstances such as disability from mental disorder. That is what we would identify as the issue: whether the approach adopted by the court in Arnold , that the crucial question is whether the verdict is unsafe operates to overpower, as it were, the one trial principle wherever the court can say there is evidence which raises the issue of whether this verdict is unsafe. Just looking at that issue, your Lordships dealt with the question of grounds for allowing the appeal at page 23 to 24 and, given the way in which you have invited us to approach it, your Lordships do not reach a conclusion there but simply leave that as an open question: that there is evidence on the one side and there is evidence on the other. We would respectfully submit that applying the test laid down in Campbell , that is to say might a jury well have found in the light of this new evidence that this was a case of diminished responsibility, your Lordships certainly do not say that that test has failed. If that test has not failed, and coming back to it at the end where your Lordships deal with it again, your Lordships do not there say it has failed, then we would submit that is the crucial test, as identified in Arnold , as being passed, and that that is more important than the question of strict adherence to the one trial principle. I accept that at pages 20 to 25 your Lordships do deal with the sufficiency of the evidence, but your Lordships do not say at any stage in this judgment that the test adopted at the start of the appeal, and formulated in the light of Campbell , that this medical evidence might well have led to the jury finding diminished responsibility. That is what I am concentrating on, the independent evidence of the three psychiatrists. The evidence of one of the doctors was that it was certainly a depressive condition capable of amounting to an abnormality of the mind. That evidence, we respectfully submit, does support the contention that a jury might well have found that this was a case of diminished responsibility. In dealing with the submissions through the evidence your Lordships merely conclude that this is not a case where a defence of diminished responsibility would have been grounds to succeed. That is, in our respectful submission, too high a test because in Arnold and Melville it is specifically not followed, in saying that evidence has to be overwhelming. So if there is a principle that if the court concludes a defence of diminished responsibility might well have succeeded, and your Lordships do not say that that is not the case here, that is more important than the one trial principle, and then we say that there is an important point of law raised by this case. Clearly there is a tension between the one trial principle with its emphasis on finality, and the ""might this new evidence have led a jury to conclude differently"" as formulated in Arnold and Campbell . We do say that this is an issue of public importance, that it is raised by the ratio of your Lordships' decision and it is a matter on which, at the least, the doors should be open so the House of Lords can reconsider. These are important matters which their Lordships' House should consider. Those are the submissions I make in relation to that point. There is one matter about sentencing which perhaps I can deal with at a later stage. MR LAWLER: This is for your Lordships. I have to confess I am in difficulty because I was only handed these points just before your Lordships sat and I have only just seen your Lordships' judgment. I have not had time to consider it. My Lords, all I would offer is this: this is very much a case with its own special facts, the court has exercised its discretion and that, we would submit, would militate against any point of public importance which requires further consideration. However should your Lordships think there is something in the submission, I would respectfully invite you, should you wish for submissions from the Crown, to defer in order to give us an opportunity to consider them. (Short break in proceedings) LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Despite the careful submissions addressed to us by Mr Fitzgerald, we are not prepared to certify. Now, there is some point you wish to make in relation to sentence, Mr Fitzgerald. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, may I just clarify the position that I had hoped I had adopted. I know that there was discussion of the interrelation of the sentence appeal and the conviction appeal, but I do not record making a concession that if we failed in relation to the conviction appeal the sentence appeal should be not be proceeded with. I appreciate your Lordships' point that one of the factors your Lordships considered is that she has at present a very long tariff, and the 12 years for the attempted murder is substantially less than that. The reason that we would have wished to argue that you proceed to deal with the question of leave to appeal against sentence is this; that whilst one can see how the one trial principle operates in relation to conviction and whilst clearly I would need your Lordships' leave to admit the new evidence in relation to sentence -- we are not saying the attempted murder point is one where that, but for the evidence of depression, it would not necessarily have been in issue -- the court can adopt a far more liberal approach in relation to new evidence that goes to sentencing. It is very often the case that between the original trial and sentencing new evidence comes to light and the Court of Appeal considers it because it does not offend against the one trial principle, that the conviction is inviolate unless one gives a reasonable explanation, and then the court can consider the evidence. Indeed, perhaps in the interests of public interest, the court should adopt a different approach to sentencing, so that having been convicted a person can lay the full facts before the Court of Appeal. Our submission would be that the objective evidence, independently verified evidence, which your Lordships will recall was quite dramatic in relation to this appellant's state of mind, the repeated admissions to the hospital throughout February with a series of complaints, the collapses, the overdoses, does afford evidence which is strong mitigating evidence in relation to the attempted murder. There is no inhibition that to admit that evidence to be heard in relation to sentence would offend against the one trial principle which clearly the court has to operate more strictly in relation to an application to challenge a conviction. So our application would be that the new evidence -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Realistically what does the sentence in relation to the attempted murder matter? MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, it matters in this way. You are aware that there is a very long tariff. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand the tariff but I do not at the moment see why you say that bears directly on the tariff. MR FITZGERALD: The point that one would wish to put to the Home Secretary in relation to the tariff is that objective, independent evidence of mental disorder which may not have been sufficient to upset the conviction should be taken into account in relation to the appropriate sentence. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now we are talking about the sentence in relation to the offence of murder, are we not? That I do understand, but I do not at the moment see why it matters, in realistic terms at the end of the day, to your client what the sentence for attempted murder was, whether one thing or the other, as long as the sentence in the relation to the murder persists. MR FITZGERALD: Our argument is this. If in fact the sentence of 12 years was too long, and for reasons already stated evidence of depression was not there at the time of the trial, then it should be reduced in any event as a matter of justice. If it is too long, it should be cut down. It is not academic because if it comes down then that is a powerful case, albeit the conviction stays in place, that shows that the rejection of the conviction appeal does not mean that there are not mitigating circumstances which have seen the light of day and should be taken into account. MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: Presumably the tariff was fixed at a time when the appellant was still maintaining that she was not responsible for the events. Of course all the medical evidence can be used in whatever way you, as her advisors, think appropriate. MR FITZGERALD: Clearly that is one of the most important matters we wish to establish. If the attempted murder sentence is too long because it failed to take account of factors which are now available then, in our respectful submission, it should be reduced. I accept, of course, that your Lordships can take into account the exercise of your discretion, the fact that there is this, as it were, supervening event of the conviction of murder. For example in the case of Batty , (1984) Cr App R, there was a conviction for murder of an Indian diplomat and, at the same time, for false imprisonment of that diplomat. The Court of Appeal heard an appeal against the sentence for the false imprisonment and reduced it on the basis that if it was too long it should be reduced. The effect of a reduction might influence the Home Secretary in his approach to the tariff for murder. So what I am asking your Lordships to do is not without precedent. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shall we look at it? MR FITZGERALD: It is 1984, Batty . MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: Speaking for myself, of course, this is a high risk strategy. Supposing we accept your submission that we should examine it and then reject your submissions, then what? MR FITZGERALD: One always runs that risk. MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: I hope I make my thoughts clear to you. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may be better to use what you have, than to deploy an argument which fails. MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: That is what I am suggesting in a rather Delphic way. It is only a suggestion. MR FITZGERALD: I am aware that you are going to take the decision is relation to both matters. My Lord, can I put it this way? If you take the view that the supervening event renders it not in the interest of justice, then I will not persist. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think is very important that the further evidence should be available to the Secretary of State, that is a different matter altogether. It is not a matter over which we have control. MR FITZGERALD: I am grateful for that indication. Clearly new issues have arisen which may not go to the interests of justice in relation to the conviction. Your observations will, I am sure, carry weight with the Home Secretary. In those circumstances I will not take the matter further. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: In those circumstances we seemed to have cleared the ground, and the application as I understand is not being pursued any further; is that right, Mr Fitzgerald? MR FITZGERALD: It is. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you very much.

The appellant had sued both Bala and Azam, and on 25th February 1992 her solicitors wrote to Azam's solicitors, saying that the appellant had informed them that ""the two families are now speaking again and that there appears to be some measure of agreement between them."" The letter continues :- ""We understand it is suggested that this action be concluded with our client making no further claims against your client and your client withdrawing his claims against our client's property so that the net result would be that the damages action against your client would cease but that your client would accept our client's title to the property. ......."". Azam's solicitors replied immediately indicating that according to their client there had been no discussion along the lines suggested, and on 29th February 1992, when Azam visited number 251, the appellant, with the apparent intention of killing him, gave him food laced with arsenic. So count 4 in the indictment charged her with attempted murder. Azam was very ill, but in due course he was discharged from hospital and continued his association with the appellant. At that stage he apparently did not appreciate that she had attempted to poison him. On 6th March 1992 the appellant's solicitors, having heard formally from Azam's solicitors in relation to the alleged proposal to settle the civil action, wrote to the appellant as follows :- ""The solicitors to Mr Azam have written to say that he denies entering into any agreement with you and that the case must proceed. I will let you know when the pressure next arrives to make some progress with the case. I presume until then you would wish me to allow the matters to rest."" It was the prosecution case that having failed to remove the threat to her title to number 251 by means of an agreement the appellant resorted again to arsenic, and on 10th April 1992 at her home she laced Azam's food with a fatal dose, hence the charge of murder which was count 5 in the indictment. There was evidence that about 3.0 am next morning, when he was very ill, Azam told his wife that he had eaten gagrella at Zoora's and there was also evidence that the appellant tried to persuade Azam's sister not to agree to the hospital conducting the post mortem examination which took place on 13th April 1992, but which yielded no significant result. Azam was therefore buried, but soon afterwards his vomit was analysed, as a result of which his body was exhumed. The presence of arsenic was firmly established, and on 17th April 1992 the appellant was arrested. She was interviewed many times, but constantly denied any wrongdoing, and chose not to give evidence at her trial. The Defence Case at Trial Although the appellant did not give evidence she did not simply put the prosecution to proof. She was represented by Mr Murdoch of T.I. Clough & Co., an experienced criminal defence solicitor who gave evidence before us, and who, with the assistance of an interpreter, took detailed instructions. Those instructions were conveyed to Mr James Stewart Q.C. and Mr Andrew Campbell, and throughout the hearing of this appeal Mr Edward Fitzgerald, Q.C. , who now appears for the appellant, has accepted, in our judgment rightly, that the appellant was competently represented in the court below. For reasons which will become apparent it is of some significance to see what the defence was which was advanced, and we know what it was because we have a full transcript of Mr Stewart's final speech. Dealing with the matter chronologically, Mr Stewart submitted that Azam, at least at times, abused the appellant's trust in relation to the house at Legram's Lane for which she had paid everything by asserting that his interest in the house was more than nominal. Nevertheless Mr Stewart contended that this cause of friction between the appellant and Azam was not such a central feature of the case as the prosecution alleged. Between 1984 and 1989, when Azam was in prison, the appellant did form a close relationship with Raghib, and in 1988 when she wanted to go to Pakistan to see her sick father she did want to sell the house to Raghib to raise money for the journey, thinking that she would buy the house back on her return, but she did not forge Azam's signature on the power of Attorney, nor did she know who did so, even though she falsely told the police that the document was signed by Azam in his wife's presence. Similarly she did not endorse Azam's signature on the back of the cheque for £620 before it was paid into her account. As Mr Stewart put it ""someone forged it; it was not Zoora"". The proposed sale to Raghib in 1988 did not proceed, not because of any difficulty with the Power of Attorney, but because the appellant's father recovered, and she no longer needed to raise money to go to Pakistan. In March 1989, before Azam was released from prison, he became aware of and jealous of her affair with Raghib. In a letter to the appellant of 13th March 1989 Azam asserted that the appellant was using ""my property"" in an immoral way and he threatened to refer them to the authorities. Another letter of 18th April 1989, is in similar vein, so it was contended on the appellant's behalf that the 1989 letters claiming non-payment of rent and misuse of the £620 cheque should not be taken at face value. Azam and the appellant both knew perfectly well that no rent was due and that the £620 was money to which the appellant was entitled. After Azam was released from prison in May 1989 the defence contention was that he and the appellant were reconciled. To quote Mr Stewart again ""they forgave each other; they became friends again, which is what Zoora said to the police and, you may think, is borne out by other evidence."" In 1990 the appellant once again wanted to raise money to go to Pakistan, and once again the solution appeared to be the sale of 251 to Raghib. Her relations with Azam were good, he recognised that in reality the house was hers, and was happy for it to be transferred to her so she could raise money by means of a sale to Raghib. That was what she told the police, and Mr Stewart relied on that assertion. So the new solicitor, Mr Conway, was visited by a man and a woman on 26th February and 5th March 1990. But the appellant was not there on either occasion. The records kept for her by her daughter Naseem were relied on to show that on each occasion she was looking after someone who was disabled . Thus, it was contended, she could have had no part in forging the transfer document which is referred to in count 1. The incitement to murder alleged in count 3 was entirely attributable to mischief making by Bala. When the appellant's relationship with Azam was good Bala intervened and told Azam that the appellant wanted him killed. He then told the appellant that Azam wanted to kill her. Mr Stewart poured scorn on the suggestion that the appellant had given Bala £2000 and some valuable bangles to do the deed. Those to whom Bala said that he had passed on the bangles and some of the money were criticised because they had no documentary evidence to support what they said, and the authenticity of the tape-recording was questioned, largely on the basis that the police and the expert had only been furnished with a copy. In the period of disturbed relationships allegedly brought about by Bala, Fawad Alam gave evidence that he went with Azam to break the windows of number 251. According to Fawad, Azam added to the damage by breaking a television and a fishbowl, and this was of course the time when Azam's solicitors served the Notice to Quit. But at the trial Azam's wife said that within months of the Bala incident the appellant and Azam were friends again. Naseem also said that they took up again, and that was the case put by Mr Stewart to the jury. In 1991 Azam was visiting number 251 regularly and eating there, the appellant's mother was working for him in the nappy business, and he was regarded by the appellant's children as an uncle. When giving evidence Naseem said ""we were like his children. I was closer to him than a daughter would be."" The only person who, Mr Stewart suggested, was likely to have been unhappy with the arrangement was Azam's wife because Azam ""was shaming her by flaunting his relationship with another woman in public."" It was the defence contention that in the spring of 1992 the civil action brought by the appellant for damages and Azam's counter claim asserting his title to number 251 was all but over. Naseem gave evidence at the trial that ""at the time of Azam's death, as far as I knew, the action was being withdrawn. I heard this from Azam. He was saying this about 2 weeks before his death."" So the suggestion was that the letters written by Azam's solicitors did not really represent his intentions as disclosed by what he was saying to the appellant and her family. It was accepted that on the evening of 29th February 1992, after a visit to number 251, Azam was very ill, but Mr Stewart submitted that arsenic may not have been the cause. He developed that submission by reference to a body of medical evidence. The symptoms may have been attributable to severe gastro-enteritis and neuritis arising from diabetes. If they were attributable to a deliberate administration of arsenic then the jury was asked to consider whether the appellant was shown to have been the administrator. Mr Stewart conceded at the start of his address that if arsenic were deliberately administered ""you may think the probability is that whoever did it intended to murder him."" As to the events of 10th April 1992 Mr Stewart relied on the family evidence that ""Azam was not even expected that night"", and that in a house filled with relations there was no gagrella in sight and no opportunity for the appellant to administer arsenic, whether with gagrella or with anything else, because the food was taken from a communal dish. The possibility was raised that Azam may have been poisoned after he got home, and the jury was invited to look carefully at Ajaib's evidence that he told her that he had eaten ""some gagrella from Zoora's"". Was that said, or was Ajaib just wanting to implicate the appellant? If it was said, was Azam by then confused? We have gone into the defence case in some detail to show that there was nothing superficial about the case which was presented during the course of what Mr Stewart described to the jury, no doubt with a touch of flattery, as ""the fairest of trials"". In response to the case advanced by the prosecution a positive defence case was put forward, built upon evidence which was extracted from the appellant's family and other members of the Asian community. The appellant's daughter Naseem was an important witness, and of her, Mr Stewart said ""You saw Naseem. You judge her"". In relation to the title to the house Mr Stewart submitted that the appellant had no reason to resort to dishonesty or violence because ""she knew how to go to solicitors"" and on more than one occasion he pointed to her good character, her personality and her medical history to show that she was no murderess. Quite early on he said :- ""She is a woman described by her doctor as thin at the time, malnourished, rather highly strung, susceptible to periodic kidney infections, anaemia and depressions. Does she sound to you like a murderess, members of the jury?"" Later on, when dealing with the allegation of incitement to murder, Mr Stewart said :- ""What you are going to have to do is to ask yourselves whether it is conceivable that this mother of three children, who is one of life's losers you may think, who is described by her GP as highly strung and subject to depression, could conceivably go to a man like Mir Aslam and offer to pay him £2000 to kill somebody else."" The background to those submissions is of some importance, and that is a matter to which we now turn. Medical Evidence available at Trial On 29th July 1992, six days after the appellant had been re-arrested and charged with murder, she was examined by Dr Wood a consultant psychiatrist instructed by her solicitors. She had already been seen at length by Dr Singh of the medical staff of HMP Newhall, and Dr Wood was accompanied by Daljit Kaur, a representative of the appellant's solicitors, who translated to and from Punjabi. Dr Wood did not have access to the GP notes or hospital notes, but he learnt from the appellant that she had not previously been seen by a psychiatrist although she had taken too many pills on two occasions, the most recent being eight years previously. She said that she had been beaten by her husband, but felt badly let down and disgraced by his leaving her. Dr Wood got the impression that she might well have had a succession of men friends thereafter, but she denied that, although she said that she had called the police when pestered by men and had attacked two men who had given her unwanted attention. Dr Wood also thought that she may have been anxious and depressed prior to the alleged offence of murder. At page 5 of his report he says :- ""My discussions of the current allegation of murder elicited straight forward denials from this accused. She was plainly aware of the nature and the seriousness of the charge that she is facing, but she told me that she had not committed any offence. She was prepared to give a very detailed account of the background to her acquaintance with the victim of this offence, and she was determined that she had not done anything to deserve to be charged with murder."" Dr Wood considered the risks if she were to be granted bail, and concluded :- ""It was plain on 29th July, 1992 that she was not suffering from a depressive illness."" On 7th October 1993 at the request of the court, another consultant psychiatrist Dr Paul Collins examined the appellant at Newhall. He had access to IQ tests and to her inmate medical record, which included photocopies of some GP records covering the six months prior to her remand in custody. He had also read the depositions, so he knew the case against her. Dr Collins obtained a medical history from the appellant who told him, amongst other things, that she had been to see her GP because of worry and depression, but she said that at the time of Azam's death ""she did not feel depressed, nor did she have any trouble sleeping, eating or with her general health."" She described her life as normal, but forcefully refused to answer questions relating to sexual matters which she said were of no relevance. Dr Collins found her presentation to be consistent with mild depression. His opinion was that with the aid of an interpreter she would be able to follow court proceedings and give instructions to her legal advisors. Dr Collins concluded :- ""Following her reception into custody there was some evidence of depression, which was probably reactive to the situation in which she found herself and which may persist to some extent still. From my interview and examination of Zoora Ghulam Shah and the other information available to me I am not of the opinion that at the material time she suffered from such an abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts or omissions in playing or being a party to the killing of the victim."" During the course of the trial the appellant's solicitors, on the advice of counsel, obtained a statement from the appellant's general practitioner Dr Mughal, which was read to the jury. She had only become his patient in February 1992, so his statement consists mainly of a review of her general practitioner records which showed depression or anxiety intermittently since early 1986, anaemia and kidney infections. Dr Mughal had himself observed her to be thin and malnourished, and rather highly strung. He said that no medicine prescribed for her would have caused her to become depressed. So the medical evidence at that time, as it seems to us, was all one way. It showed that the appellant had often sought medical assistance, that she had suffered to some extent from depression and anxiety, but there was no evidence that at the material time when Azam died she was suffering from such an abnormality of mind as would have substantially impaired her responsibility for her acts. Furthermore when examined in custody she appreciated her position, she co-operated with the examiner, and was plainly so far as could be ascertained capable (with the assistance of an interpreter) of giving instructions to solicitors and counsel in the normal way. Developments after Sentence. On 23rd March Grounds of Appeal were settled by trial counsel in relation to the conviction on counts 4 and 5, and in relation to the sentence imposed on counts 1 and 3. On 2nd April 1994 leave to appeal was refused by the single judge. Thereafter the appellant instructed her present solicitors, and they instructed Pragna Patel, a part-time community worker with Southhall Black Sisters to visit the appellant. She did so on many occasions over a period of 18 months, and assisted the appellant to prepare a full statement which, together with the solicitors, Pragna Patel reduced to the 59 page statement which we have seen. We summarise what in that statement the appellant says :- (1) persistently over the years she had lied to the police, the doctors and to her lawyers. (2) her husband had been violent to her, yet when he left her she was worse off - stranded in a strange land, unable to speak English, and with young sick children. (3) having met Azam she decided to have sex with him in return for his help. In her statement she said at first she thought she loved him, but that was not her evidence in the witness box. Before Azam lent his name to the purchase of 251 Legram's Lane she knew that he was involved in drugs and kept weapons. She sought help from Raghib but he was afraid of Azam, and for what help he gave her he ""extracted a price"". She became pregnant by Azam and eventually had an abortion - it was one of several she had over the years. (4) in about October 1982 she went to Pakistan to see her father and was told by Azam to bring back drugs. He was angry when she did not do so. He took her to the cemetery where her children were buried, and there abused her verbally, physically and sexually. (5) in about 1983 she when pregnant took an overdose of tablets but vomited, recovered and eventually had an abortion. Even when she was weak and unwell Azam demanded sex. (6) on one occasion when the appellant was ill Azam threatened to turn his attention to Naseem, then aged about 10. (7) when Azam was arrested in April 1984 she visited him in prison, and Zamoorat (Azam's sister's husband) began to call on her. He and Raghib had keys, and both sexually abused her whilst Azam was in prison. Zamoorat and others claimed to do so with Azam's approval. (8) in 1986 Naseem was sent to Pakistan because of Azam's ""persistent interest"" in her. (9) the forgery of transfer documents in relation to 251 was Raghib's idea. he said that Azam would never give her the house but offered her money, which she needed to go to Pakistan, if she co-operated in getting the house transferred to his name. About £2000 of the £9638.62 paid to Mr Conway on 5th March 1990 to redeem the mortgage came from her own and Naseem's savings, the rest came from the committee and from Raghib. (10) when Azam came out of prison he threatened to evict her and leave her to Raghib. He also denied sending Zamoorat to her. In the result both Azam and Raghib continued to abuse her, and Azam expressed further interest in Naseem, who was then sent back to Pakistan. She appealed to Azam's brother Sher Azam an ""elder"" in the community but he declined to help. (11) because of Azam's treatment of her she did ask Bala to beat up Azam, to show that there was someone on her side. Bala said that as Azam was a very dangerous man she would then be in danger, and recommended that Azam be killed. After discussing the proposal with Raghib she agreed, and gave Bala money and jewellery. (12) after her attempt to hire Bala to kill Azam was discovered, Tariq , who she had met through Raghib, suggested that she say that she was raped. She knew Azam to be behind the damage done to her house and he and Fawad continued to harass her after the binding over. Damage was done to her home in May 1990 while she was in Pakistan for the wedding of Naseem. (13) whilst in Pakistan she obtained a taveez (writing on a piece of paper) from a holy man, intending to give it to Azam to get him to transfer the house to her name and to leave her alone. The taveez was to be administered by putting the paper in water until the ink dissolved and then getting Azam to drink the water. She also got Dr Sejad to give her something to affect Azam's legs and make him impotent. He gave her a green powder (Neela totha) and told her that a teaspoon would have the desired effect, but if she gave more Azam would die. (14) on return to England she did not use the powder, but still feared Azam's interest in Naseem despite Naseem's marriage, and early in 1992 she was afraid that he was interested in Fozia as well. So she arranged for Fozia to go with her mother to Pakistan. (15) on 29th February 1992 when she used the powder because of Azam's continuing harassment, she put some of it into a samosa mixture. She also used the taveez. She fed Naseem and Fozia first with unadulterated samosas and when Azam arrived gave him the four somosas made with the adulterated mixture. He insisted in sharing the last somosa with Naseem and Fozia, which the appellant could only watch helplessly, but when he left she gave them milk and got them to vomit. (16) after Azam recovered he behaved as before. The appellant was very exhausted, and on one occasion had to be admitted to hospital. On discharge Azam took her to his friend Akhtar's house, and despite discouragement from the appellant made sexual advances to her in the presence of Akhtar's girlfriend. (17) Azam was again talking about Fozia (now nearly 12) and was angry when the appellant said that she planned to send Fozia to Pakistan with her mother for 4 weeks. On 10th April 1992 Azam again took the appellant to the cemetery for sex and on the way back she got him to buy some gagrella. She got home about 4 pm and Azam then left. She knew he would return about 8 pm and before he did so she added about a full teaspoon of the green powder to the gagrella. There were a number of relatives in the house and when Azam returned she took him aside into the front room to ask him not to make a fuss about Fozia going to Pakistan. His price was that she have sexual intercourse with him. She agreed, and got him then to eat the gagrella. In her statement the appellant does not say that on 10th April she intended to kill Azam. She says that she wanted him to become so ill that he would not be able to touch her again, and, by inference, would be no threat to her daughters. Dr Lipsedge, a consultant psychiatrist at Guys Hospital in London who has particular experience of trans-cultural psychiatry, was then consulted. He saw the appellant on 22nd March 1997 with Pragna Patel at Durham Prison, and concluded that she was suffering from a mental disorder when she poisoned Azam. The disorder was, in his opinion, a severe depressive illness which developed as a reaction to Azam's behaviour towards her and her daughters, and it diminished her responsibility at the material time. Further statements were obtained from Dr Mughal and Naseem, and fresh grounds of appeal were prepared in relation to counts 4 and 5 which admit to the deliberate administration of poison but contend that - (a) in relation to the offence of attempted murder (count 4) there was no intent to kill, only an attempt to render Azam impotent and incapable of causing further physical harassment: (b) in relation to the offence of murder (count 5) when administering the laced gagrella the appellant ""was no longer concerned whether Azam lived or died"". The court was invited to receive the appellant's 59 page statement, and the report of Dr Lipsedge together with an addendum of 18th June 1997, and to conclude that a reasonable jury in the light of the fresh evidence would acquit the appellant of murder and convict her of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility: alternatively it would be assisted by the report to conclude that the Crown had failed to disprove provocation. Of course neither the issue of provocation nor the issue of diminished responsibility played any part in the trial, but in the light of the fresh evidence the convictions are said in the grounds of appeal to be unsafe and unsatisfactory. On 7th July 1997 the full court (differently constituted) gave leave to appeal, without deciding whether the evidence of any individual potential witness should be received. Statements continued to be taken, even after we began to hear the appeal, and we now have - (1) a wealth of psychiatric evidence, including not only the original reports of Dr Wood and Dr Collins and the report of Dr Lipsedge, but also further reports from Dr Collins and Dr Lipsedge and reports from Dr Shubsachs and Dr Rix (instructed by the Crown): (2) General Practitioner material, including records and statements of successive General Practitioners Dr Modi, Dr Abbasi and Dr Mughal: (3) Social services records: (4) Statements from a number of lay witnesses who observed the appellant's demeanour at the relevant time: (5) A statement from Mr Murdoch, the solicitor who acted for her. Conduct of this Appeal We agreed to hear some witnesses orally, and to look at the rest of the material without deciding pursuant to section 23 Criminal Appeals Act 1968, as amended, whether or not to receive the evidence. We therefore heard oral evidence from Dr Mughal, the appellant, Mr Murdoch and Dr Lipsedge. We also heard submissions on behalf of the appellant and on behalf of the Crown. Mr Fitzgerald for the appellant urges us to receive the fresh evidence and to allow the appeal on the basis that once the evidence is received it becomes clear that the appellant was suffering from a depressive illness and that the defence of diminished responsibility ""might well succeed and might well have succeeded at the trial if advanced on the present lines"" (to use the words of Lord Bingham CJ in Campbell (1997 1 Cr App R 199 ). The conviction is therefore said to be unsafe (see section 2(1)(a) of the 1968 Act as amended) and the appeal in relation to that count should be allowed. Mr Fitzgerald recognises that if the appeal is allowed the normal course is to order a re-trial, and he did not seek to persuade us to adopt any other course, but he submitted that as count 4 (attempted murder) is closely linked with count 5 the conviction in relation to count 4 should also be set aside and the order for a re-trial should apply to that count also, so that the appellant can deploy further evidence of lack of intent to kill. Mr Fitzgerald accepted that if he could not persuade us to order a re-trial to enable the appellant to raise the issue of diminished responsibility he could not on the evidence available achieve that result to raise the issue of provocation, but he reserved the right if a re-trial is ordered to raise that issue also. The Crown's primary submission is that the fresh evidence should not be received, and it is really common ground that without fresh evidence the appeal must fail. Alternatively Mr Smith contends that if the fresh evidence is received it can be seen on analysis to be of little weight as the experts on whom the appellant relies are themselves relying on what she has told them, and she is a witness whose evidence has been demonstrated to be not worthy of belief. To that Mr Fitzgerald replies that the experts have other sources of information and their evidence can survive even if, contrary to his submissions, her evidence is not believed. Should the fresh evidence be received? Section 23 of the 1968 Act, as amended, provides so far as relevant :- ""(1) For the purposes of this Part of this Act the Court of Appeal may, if they think it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice - (c) receive any evidence which was not adduced in the proceedings from which the appeal lies. (2) the Court of Appeal shall in considering whether to receive any evidence have regard in particular to - (a) whether the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief; (b) whether it appears to the Court that the evidence may afford any ground for allowing the appeal; (c) whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal; and (d) whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence in those proceedings."" We therefore have a discretion under subsection (1). In deciding how to exercise that discretion we must give primary consideration to what is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice, but we must also pay particular regard to the four matters listed in subsection (2). We turn therefore to consider each of those four matters separately. (a) Capable of Belief? We consider first the appellant's own evidence. Making every possible allowance for the difficulty of giving evidence through an interpreter to English judges whose experience of Asian culture is bound to be limited, we have to say that we found the appellant to be a most unsatisfactory witness, and her evidence to be not capable of belief. For example she said when giving evidence in chief that at the very beginning of their sexual relationship, before she went to number 251, Azam raped her. In cross-examination she said he treated her with respect ""when we first bought the house"" (i.e. number 251). She professed, perhaps rightly, to care a great deal for her daughters, but if what she has told us is right she never warned Naseem to beware of Azam although she believed that he posed a threat to her, and she stood by on 29th February 1992 and watched both daughters eat part of the samosa which she knew to be poisoned. She was not prepared to admit that she got Naseem to lie for her at her trial, but if her evidence to us is correct Naseem's account of eating samosas bought at a shop which the appellant could not have tampered with, and her portrayal of a happy relationship between the appellant, her daughters and Azam right up to the time of his death must have been a lie. The whole theme of the appellant's evidence to us was that for years she was subjected to physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Azam, Raghib, Zamoorat, and others, yet no one seems to have noticed a single suspicious bruise (other than one black eye), nor does she seem to have shared with any one what she now says was the cause of her troubles. We appreciate that for someone from her background it may not have been easy to unburden herself, but she had many contacts - three successive general practitioners, all Asian; social services representatives to whom she did speak about intimate matters such as abortion, and who included two ladies from her own culture; hospital staff, police and solicitors. Furthermore, although plainly at times anxious, undernourished and depressed she was, according to her daughter, a ""strong-willed woman"", and there was clear evidence of that in what she did. She not only broke the windscreen of a car belonging to one man, but, as the history shows, she conspired to commit forgery, hired a hit man (Bala) and, when double crossed made allegations of rape and theft which she now admits to be false. If she was prepared to share problems with a holy man and Dr Sejad in Pakistan when the problems were themselves many miles away we cannot see what prevented her from sharing them with doctors, social workers and others in Bradford who shared her cultural background, especially when her own liberty was at stake. Of course it would not be easy to say that she was being persistently sexually abused, but when she eventually alleged abuse by Zamoorat it was on six or eight occasions in her statement, but on a hundred occasions to Dr Shubsachs. That degree of discrepancy makes it impossible to accept that either version is true. Part of the appellant's explanation for the lack of candour with solicitors after her arrest was that she was led by them to believe that the case against her was not strong, but in cross-examination she conceded that she had no such illusions by the time of the trial and, having heard from Mr Murdoch, we very much doubt whether she had any illusions long prior to that. More than once the appellant referred to the Koran. She said that she did not give evidence at her trial because she did not wish to take the oath and then tell lies, but she accepted that she did just that at Azam's trial in 1984, and if what she now says is right she did it again when she swore an affidavit in relation to her civil action. More generally by her own admission she has lied repeatedly in the past, and we are far from satisfied that she has ceased to do so in the account she puts forward now. For present purposes we accept that the other evidence now laid before us - from lay witnesses, general practitioners, social workers, a solicitor and two consultant psychiatrists - is capable of belief. As Lord Bingham CJ said in Steven Jones (1997) 1 Cr. App. R. 86 at 93 C :- ""The requirement in subsection 2(a) that the evidence should be capable of belief applies more aptly to factual evidence than to expert opinion, which may or may not be acceptable or persuasive but which is unlikely to be thought incapable of belief in any ordinary sense."" Dr Lipsedge and Dr Shubsachs both approached their task in the normal way. They took a history from the patient and then went on to apply their expertise on the assumption that the history was correct, which at that time coincided with their belief. If, as is now apparent to us, both doctors were misled, the question arises as to whether their opinions can survive. Mr Smith submits that they cannot, but the two psychiatrists, in late supplementary reports tendered after the appellant gave her evidence, say that their conclusions are adequately supported by evidence drawn from other sources - GP records, hospital records, social services records, lay witnesses' observations, etc. That seems to us to be a tenable position for the two psychiatrists to adopt, but it is undeniable that their views would have carried much more weight if in each case it were possible for us to regard the patient's history as reliable. As Dr Rix points out, the patient's history - her record of symptoms - is one of the pillars on which psychiatric diagnosis stands. If the conclusions of Dr Lipsedge, Dr Shubsachs and to some extent Dr Mughal were to be accepted at face value then a jury would find that at the time of the killing the appellant was suffering from a depressive illness - a major depressive episode. Up to a point Dr Rix agrees. He considers that the appellant did suffer from a depressive or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, but on 29th July 1992 (3½ months after the killing) Dr Wood said that it was plain that she was not suffering from a depressive illness although she may have been anxious and depressed prior to the offence occurring. Dr Collins, who has seen the appellant on two occasions, one of them shortly before her trial, says that ""deliberate fatal poisoning of adults is not compatible with significant clinical depression"". The force of that point is easily grasped by a non-medical mind especially where, as here, the poisoning is repeated. (b) Grounds for allowing the appeal? The defence relied upon is diminished responsibility, which is set out in section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957. So far as material, it provides :- (1) where a person kills .... another he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts ..... in doing... the killing. (2) on a charge of murder, it shall be for the defence to prove that the person charged is by virtue of this section not liable to be convicted of murder. ""Abnormality of mind"" means a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that a reasonable person would judge it to be abnormal ( Byrne (1960) 2 QB 396). If a jury were to accept without qualification the views of Dr Lipsedge and Dr Shubsachs as to the extent of the appellant's depressive illness at the time of the killing then it may well be that they would find that she suffered from abnormality of mind, but, as Dr Rix points out, it does not necessarily follow that because a depressive or mixed anxiety and depressive disorder is present there was an abnormality of mind - ""Whether or not a jury would have regarded it as amounting to an abnormality of mind, which such disorders are capable of being, would depend on how they appraised the various elements of the evidence."" Similar problems arise in relation to the next ingredient in the statutory defence. If there was an abnormality of mind it must have been such as substantially impaired the appellant's responsibility for what she did. In other words it must have been a real cause of the appellant's conduct in poisoning Azam. It need not have been the sole cause, but she must show that its effect was more than merely trivial ( Lloyd (1967 1 QB 175). Here again, as it seems to us, the evidence of Dr Lipsedge, Dr Shubsachs and Dr Mughal, if accepted, does provide the basis for such a finding, but there are three consultant psychiatrists who express a different point of view, including both of those who saw the appellant before her trial. (c) Admissibility If the issue of diminished responsibility had been raised at the trial the evidence now sought to be relied upon would have been admissible, subject to exclusion of hearsay from the medical evidence (See Bradshaw (1986) 82 Cr. App. R. 79). But it was held in Melville (1975) 62 Cr. App. R. 100 that when section 23 of the 1968 Act speaks of the evidence being ""admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal"" that ""means an issue which was raised below and is the subject of the appeal in this court"" (per Lord Widgery CJ at 104). The emphasis is ours. Although Melville was decided long before the 1968 Act was amended the words in question have not been changed. It follows that in our judgment the fresh evidence does not meet the criteria in section 23(2)(c). (d) Reasonable Explanation for failure to adduce We accept that in some cases where the issue of diminished responsibility is not raised at the trial the explanation may be found in the same medical condition which is said on appeal to furnish the appellant with a defence. For example, in the recent case of Borthwick 27th October 1997 unreported, this court considered the possibility that an appellant said to be a paranoid psychotic, may not have been able to give rational instructions as to the way in which his defence was to be run. But that is not this case. Here Mr Fitzgerald submits that the appellant put forward a defence which she now admits to have been a tissue of lies because she wished to protect herself and especially her family from further shame and the risk of violence. We heard evidence from the appellant and from Dr Lipsedge as to the importance of honour in the society from which the appellant springs, and as to the possibility of retaliatory violence. Up to a point that is evidence which we accept, but only up to a point because this appellant, as it seems to us, is an unusual woman. Her way of life had been such that there might not have been much left of her honour to salvage, and she was certainly capable of striking out on her own when she thought it advisable to do so, even if it might be thought to bring shame on her or to expose her to the risk of retaliation. The forgery executed to obtain title, and the false allegations of rape and theft made against Bala are but two examples of that. The nature of her defence at the trial which involved an open attack on Bala and others, and a thinly veiled suggestion that the deceased's own widow might have been responsible for his death is another example. So we find ourselves wholly unable to conclude that the appellant has put forward a reasonable explanation for what happened in the court below. If she had not chosen to lie about her role in administering the poison it seems likely that her solicitors would have gone back to Dr Wood for a further medical report, and it may be that evidence would then have been forthcoming which would have enabled the defence of diminished responsibility to be raised, but that, at this stage, must be a matter of speculation. Necessary or Expedient in the Interests of Justice? Having given careful consideration to the matters identified in section 23(2) to which we are required to have regard when deciding whether or not to receive fresh evidence we return now to the discretionary powers set out in section 23(1). We may receive the evidence if we consider it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to do so. In Steven Jones (supra) Lord Bingham CJ at 93A said of section 23 that it acknowledges in subsection 2(d) - ""The crucial obligation on a defendant in a criminal case to advance his whole defence and any evidence on which he relies before the trial jury. He is not entitled to hold evidence in reserve and then seek to introduce it on appeal following conviction. While failure to give a reasonable explanation for failure to adduce the evidence before the jury is not a bar to reception of the evidence on appeal, it is a matter which the court is obliged to consider in deciding whether to receive the evidence or not."" That was an echo of what was said by Lord Taylor CJ in Ahluwalia (1993) 96 Cr App R 133 at 142 - ""Ordinarily, of course, any available defences should be advanced at trial. Accordingly if medical evidence is available to support a plea of diminished responsibility it should be adduced at the trial. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that this court would require much persuasion to allow such a defence to be raised for the first time here if the option had been exercised at trial not to pursue it. Otherwise, as must be clear, defendants might be encouraged to run one defence at trial in the belief that if it fails this court would allow a different defence to be raised and give the defendant, in effect, two opportunities to run different defences. Nothing could be further from the truth. Likewise, if there is no evidence to support diminished responsibility at the time of the trial, this court would view any wholly retrospective medical evidence obtained long after the trial with considerable scepticism."" Mr Fitzgerald submits that even if a defendant puts forward a lying defence the interests of justice may require this court to permit him or her to put forward a different defence if persuasive evidence to support such a defence is available by the time that the case reaches the Court of Appeal. We recognise that in some situations that may be the case, but we see little room for the operation of such a principle in a case of murder where a defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility for the acts or omissions which caused the death. If his choice was forced upon him by his illness then of course the position is quite different, but in general no one is entitled to more than one trial, and that, in our judgment, is a principle which ought to apply in this case. Mr Fitzgerald invited our attention to other cases in which this court has considered the provisions of section 23 and received fresh evidence and sent the case back for re-trial, even though the appellant had put forward a lying defence at his trial. In Richardson 9th May 1991 unreported, that course was adopted, but only it would seem because of the problems which arose as a result of the case being handled by different divisions of this court, and it must always be borne in mind that the power in section 23(1) is discretionary. In Ahluwalia (supra) the appellant's responsibility for the acts which caused death was never in issue, and the evidence of diminished responsibility was available at the time of trial. When giving judgment Lord Taylor CJ said at 143 - ""It is unclear how this potentially important material came to be overlooked or was not further pursued at the time of trial."" In Arnold 7th February 1996 unreported, a case to which Mr Fitzgerald referred on more than one occasion, the appeal failed because no reasonable explanation was given for the failure to adduce evidence of diminished responsibility at the trial, and the court concluded that the new evidence, if received, would do nothing to show that the convictions were unsafe. So the decision in each of the cases relied upon turned on the particular facts of that case, and each case emphasizes the point that only in wholly exceptional circumstances will this court receive fresh evidence to enable a defence to be advanced which was not put forward at the trial. Leaving aside for the moment the one trial principle to which we have referred there are, as it seems to us, other reasons why in this case we should hesitate to exercise our discretion in favour of admitting the fresh evidence. The appellant's own evidence is, as we have said, not capable of belief. The medical evidence on which she seeks to rely came into existence long after the relevant time, it initially relied heavily on her account which we have found to be flawed, and it is at variance with the evidence of the other psychiatrists who have been involved in the case. That factor is not of course decisive but compare, for example, Binning 12th April 1996 unreported, where the fresh evidence was unchallenged. We recognise, of course, that in section 23(2)(b) the word used is ""may"" but we cannot treat this as a case in which had the evidence now sought to be relied upon been deployed at trial the defence of diminished responsibility would have been bound to succeed. For all of those reasons we have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to receive the further evidence in this case, and without that further evidence the appeal against conviction must fail. As Mr Fitzgerald recognised, if the appeal against conviction fails the application for leave to appeal against sentence ceases to be of any significance and it too will be dismissed. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: For the reasons set out in the judgment which has been handed down, this appeal is dismissed so far as conviction is concerned. The application for leave to appeal against sentence referred to this court is also dismissed. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, there is a proposed list of points for certification to the House of Lords. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have had the advantage of seeing those quickly, thank you. MR FITZGERALD: May I address you on this? Firstly I am seeking a certified point of law, and secondly leave to appeal. We do submit that, whatever your Lordships' view as to the leave to appeal, this judgment does raise and this case does raise points of law of general importance. The first of those, which we have identified as point 1, is that of the correct interpretation of section 23(2)(c). That is to say whether the issue must be one which was raised below as well as being raised in the grounds of appeal. My Lord, that issue is dealt with in your Lordships' judgment at page 25 and relies on the decision in Melville . So far as I and my learned friend can recall this was not a matter on which we addressed your Lordship on either side, but obviously we felt it was before the court. The position is this, that firstly we would submit, it is in a single sentence in Melville , that approach to the interpretation of similar words. It is our submission that if one looks at the exact words of section 23(2)(c), which are set out in your judgment at page 19, whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings on an issue which is the subject of the appeal. We submit that there is no reference there to the additional criteria and which was an issue below. It is true -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Nor was there in Melville , in the words which were then in play. MR FITZGERALD: The formulation is not identical, but even assuming it your Lordships are always able to reconsider a decision of the Court of Appeal where the relaxation of a previous interpretation goes in favour of a defendant or appellant. In any event this is a question of whether the House of Lords should have an opportunity of determining whether that is a correct interpretation and we submit in relation to that, firstly, that your Lordships would not be bound in any event by an interpretation if your Lordships found that it worked in justice. However, having adopted that interpretation, the issue is whether there is an important point for resolution by the House of Lords in relation to this interpretation. My Lords, the two points made are these: firstly, it is not there. The words in issue in the court below are not in the subsection. To read into a penal statute words which are not there to the disfavour of the defendants is, in our respectful submission, a big step to take. There is no necessity in reading in. Indeed evidence for that comes conclusively from the decision in Campbell where a different interpretation was adopted. I cannot say definitely that they considered the case of Melville on this point, although it was before them in the citation. My Lord, I have to accept that it is not clear that they had before them that particular passage in Campbell . However as evidence of how these words strike the Court of Appeal -- as their natural, ordinary meaning struck the Court of Appeal -- we say that the decision in Campbell adopts an approach which is quite different and far more generous to the defendant. We have set out the passage in the skeleton argument. It is plain that the evidence would have been admissible for proceedings on which the appeal lies on an issue of diminished responsibility which is subject of the appeal. So just taking the approach there of the Court of Appeal of Bingham LCJ, plainly it was not his view that there had to be an issue which had been raised in the court below. Your Lordships can see that at 204 where, having cited the modern formulation that: ""(2) the Court of Appeal shall, in considering whether to receive any evidence have regard in particular to -- ""(c) whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal."" The court applies that criteria at D: ""It is plain it is that evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue of (diminished responsibility) which is the subject of the appeal."" There is no doubt that in Campbell that diminished responsibility had not been an issue in the court below. The criteria were interpreted following exactly the words of the statute, adding nothing. In our submission the decision in Melville , which did add something which was not there and did so in a way which restricts the rights of the defendant, is in our submission one which is suspect, both because it offends the fundamental interpretation that you do with the ordinary and natural meaning of the words, and secondly because it is inconsistent with the approach taken by this court in the more recent case of Campbell . My Lord, those are the submissions we make. Of course we would submit that there is a point of law of public importance and that this needs to be resolved; whether the approach under section 23(2)(c) is that the issue must have been raised in the court below or whether in this case it is sufficient to say, as in Campbell , that it is an issue in the stipendiary Court of Appeal. If that issue had been raised in the court below it would have been admissible evidence in relation to it. It is our submission that 23(2)(c) is concerned with admissibility rather than whether the issue had been raised in the court below. The reasonable explanation deals with the question of whether the thing was raised in the court below. This is purely to ensure that the admissible test is satisfied. Those are the submissions we make on point 1. We say it is an important point. It needs resolution in the light of two or more Court of Appeal authorities as to the correct approach to its interpretation. It arises in the course of your Lordships' judgment and is part of the finding that your Lordships made. Therefore whatever is your Lordships' decision in relation to the appeal, and I appreciate that the normal course is to leave it to the House of Lords, there is a point of law of public importance and the door should not be closed to that issue being resolved. The second point we make is in relation to point 2. We say that that point arises from the passage at the bottom of page 27. May I say immediately that of course it is obviously a point of public importance where the balance is to be struck between the one trial principle that your Lordships have identified, and the principle that the most important consideration is whether there is evidence of a trial at issue which casts doubt on the safety of a conviction. We entirely accept that. That is an issue which has to be resolved. There are perhaps two approaches. One is to emphasise the one trial principle. The other is to emphasise, as the Court of Appeal did in Arnold , that the most important thing is whether an issue has been raised which goes to the safety of the conviction. However looking at your Lordships' formulation of the principle, it sets out the submission that even if a defendant puts forward a line of defence then the interests of justice may require this court to permit him or her to put forward a different defence, if persuasive evidence to support such a defence is available by the time the case reaches the Court of Appeal. The court then recognises that that might apply in some situations but took a restrictive view in relation to murder where the defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility. We see that -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: In relation to the facts of this case. This was a case of murder. It was not intended to put murder into a special category. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, that, forming a crucial part of the res desidendum, is almost inevitably going to lead to the formulation of the principle; the rightness of which would be for the House of Lords to decide. However once it is voluntary and not constrained by duress, the presumption is, in fact the rule is that there is little room for the operation of such a principle where a defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility for the acts of omissions which caused the death. In any subsequent case where the argument is put, as relied on in Arnold , what really matters is not whether the person has lied but whether there is evidence of unsafeness of conviction. In this part of the ratio we see the operation of such a principle in a case generally, not in this case, but in any case where a defendant has freely chosen to deny responsibility for the acts or omissions that caused death. My Lord, it is not an untypical situation. This is not the only case in which it is likely to arise. Indeed there are cases before the Criminal Case Review Board which raise similar issues where perhaps the degree to which the medical disorder or handicap could be an issue. We say this is a point of fundamental importance. It is not an isolated case. It is not formulated in such a way to be confined to the facts of this case. Indeed, as we understand it, your Lordships are seeking to identify a point of public policy for use in the resolution of these issues. Except where your Lordships envisage an exception where the person is so disabled by mental illness that they do not really have a choice, we would submit that of course in that case you would have a reasonable explanation, and yet Parliament clearly contemplates, and even where you do not have a reasonable explanation, that there can be cases where any reasonable explanation is absent, such as being disabled by mental illness, nonetheless it may be permissible in the interests of justice to allow the new evidence. We do stress that the court's approach is of fundamental importance. The emphasis is different to that in the decision of your Lordships' court in Arnold where it was stated at 28E: ""It is thus possible for the Court of Appeal to receive fresh evidence after a defendant has deliberately not run a particular defence at trial and even where his predicament has arisen from his having told lies at an earlier stage."" Now that was in the context of a murder case and in the context of where there were lies going to participation in murder. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We do not say it is not possible. This is the difficulty. It is a balancing exercise to be carried out on the facts of every individual case. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, it is really -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We say it is going to be difficult. MR FITZGERALD: Yes, little room for the operation of such a principle and then how can the principle operate? MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: Only in very exceptional cases, as the judgment makes clear. MR FITZGERALD: But then the example given is one which that so disabled in mental illness, you have not deliberately taken the choice because you have been disabled. My Lord, that is the point. We do submit that it is not entirely clear about what the scope of the principle is because the appellant did not give evidence and her only evidence on the record is from police interviews. My Lord, we do submit that the scope of the one trial principle, which your Lordships have identified as an important and perhaps in this case a determinative principle, is something which raises a point of law and public interest. It may be difficult to formulate the precise point of law. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am inclined to agree with you. MR FITZGERALD: That does not mean there is not an issue of -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: We can only certify if there is a point of law which we can identify. I think your difficulty is that we are in the area where there is going to be a question of judgment and discretion in this court. MR FITZGERALD: I accept that, my Lord, but if one looks at what happens in the House of Lords very often the question is a very open-ended one, such as what is the scope of the one trial principle? One does not have to define it in so limited a way that it determines the ratio of the case, but we say there is here -- obviously your Lordships know better than I do what was the ratio of the case because you decided it -- if one looks at that sentence: ""We recognise that in some situations that may be the case, but we see little room for the operation of such principle in a case of murder where a defendant has freely chosen ..."" Given how it goes on, it is likely to be presented as a ratio where someone deliberately chooses to deny responsibility, save in situations of duress or medical disorder, that the principle that lies should not stand in the way of raising the unsafeness of the conviction. That is a general principle. My Lord, that is the submission I make in relation to point 2. Point 3, formulated in manuscript, is the crucial question in determining the exercise of discretion under section 23 ""whether the proffered evidence may afford ground for ..."" My Lord, that is quoted directly from the Arnold decision. Your Lordships have obviously seen that, but it is at 23H to 24A, where having decided the reasonable explanation test, the court said that the crucial question is whether it affords a ground for allowing the appeal. We submit that there is a tension between the approach, does it afford a ground for allowing the appeal, and the one trial principle approach which must be applied, save in exceptional circumstances such as disability from mental disorder. That is what we would identify as the issue: whether the approach adopted by the court in Arnold , that the crucial question is whether the verdict is unsafe operates to overpower, as it were, the one trial principle wherever the court can say there is evidence which raises the issue of whether this verdict is unsafe. Just looking at that issue, your Lordships dealt with the question of grounds for allowing the appeal at page 23 to 24 and, given the way in which you have invited us to approach it, your Lordships do not reach a conclusion there but simply leave that as an open question: that there is evidence on the one side and there is evidence on the other. We would respectfully submit that applying the test laid down in Campbell , that is to say might a jury well have found in the light of this new evidence that this was a case of diminished responsibility, your Lordships certainly do not say that that test has failed. If that test has not failed, and coming back to it at the end where your Lordships deal with it again, your Lordships do not there say it has failed, then we would submit that is the crucial test, as identified in Arnold , as being passed, and that that is more important than the question of strict adherence to the one trial principle. I accept that at pages 20 to 25 your Lordships do deal with the sufficiency of the evidence, but your Lordships do not say at any stage in this judgment that the test adopted at the start of the appeal, and formulated in the light of Campbell , that this medical evidence might well have led to the jury finding diminished responsibility. That is what I am concentrating on, the independent evidence of the three psychiatrists. The evidence of one of the doctors was that it was certainly a depressive condition capable of amounting to an abnormality of the mind. That evidence, we respectfully submit, does support the contention that a jury might well have found that this was a case of diminished responsibility. In dealing with the submissions through the evidence your Lordships merely conclude that this is not a case where a defence of diminished responsibility would have been grounds to succeed. That is, in our respectful submission, too high a test because in Arnold and Melville it is specifically not followed, in saying that evidence has to be overwhelming. So if there is a principle that if the court concludes a defence of diminished responsibility might well have succeeded, and your Lordships do not say that that is not the case here, that is more important than the one trial principle, and then we say that there is an important point of law raised by this case. Clearly there is a tension between the one trial principle with its emphasis on finality, and the ""might this new evidence have led a jury to conclude differently"" as formulated in Arnold and Campbell . We do say that this is an issue of public importance, that it is raised by the ratio of your Lordships' decision and it is a matter on which, at the least, the doors should be open so the House of Lords can reconsider. These are important matters which their Lordships' House should consider. Those are the submissions I make in relation to that point. There is one matter about sentencing which perhaps I can deal with at a later stage. MR LAWLER: This is for your Lordships. I have to confess I am in difficulty because I was only handed these points just before your Lordships sat and I have only just seen your Lordships' judgment. I have not had time to consider it. My Lords, all I would offer is this: this is very much a case with its own special facts, the court has exercised its discretion and that, we would submit, would militate against any point of public importance which requires further consideration. However should your Lordships think there is something in the submission, I would respectfully invite you, should you wish for submissions from the Crown, to defer in order to give us an opportunity to consider them. (Short break in proceedings) LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Despite the careful submissions addressed to us by Mr Fitzgerald, we are not prepared to certify. Now, there is some point you wish to make in relation to sentence, Mr Fitzgerald. MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, may I just clarify the position that I had hoped I had adopted. I know that there was discussion of the interrelation of the sentence appeal and the conviction appeal, but I do not record making a concession that if we failed in relation to the conviction appeal the sentence appeal should be not be proceeded with. I appreciate your Lordships' point that one of the factors your Lordships considered is that she has at present a very long tariff, and the 12 years for the attempted murder is substantially less than that. The reason that we would have wished to argue that you proceed to deal with the question of leave to appeal against sentence is this; that whilst one can see how the one trial principle operates in relation to conviction and whilst clearly I would need your Lordships' leave to admit the new evidence in relation to sentence -- we are not saying the attempted murder point is one where that, but for the evidence of depression, it would not necessarily have been in issue -- the court can adopt a far more liberal approach in relation to new evidence that goes to sentencing. It is very often the case that between the original trial and sentencing new evidence comes to light and the Court of Appeal considers it because it does not offend against the one trial principle, that the conviction is inviolate unless one gives a reasonable explanation, and then the court can consider the evidence. Indeed, perhaps in the interests of public interest, the court should adopt a different approach to sentencing, so that having been convicted a person can lay the full facts before the Court of Appeal. Our submission would be that the objective evidence, independently verified evidence, which your Lordships will recall was quite dramatic in relation to this appellant's state of mind, the repeated admissions to the hospital throughout February with a series of complaints, the collapses, the overdoses, does afford evidence which is strong mitigating evidence in relation to the attempted murder. There is no inhibition that to admit that evidence to be heard in relation to sentence would offend against the one trial principle which clearly the court has to operate more strictly in relation to an application to challenge a conviction. So our application would be that the new evidence -- LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Realistically what does the sentence in relation to the attempted murder matter? MR FITZGERALD: My Lord, it matters in this way. You are aware that there is a very long tariff. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand the tariff but I do not at the moment see why you say that bears directly on the tariff. MR FITZGERALD: The point that one would wish to put to the Home Secretary in relation to the tariff is that objective, independent evidence of mental disorder which may not have been sufficient to upset the conviction should be taken into account in relation to the appropriate sentence. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now we are talking about the sentence in relation to the offence of murder, are we not? That I do understand, but I do not at the moment see why it matters, in realistic terms at the end of the day, to your client what the sentence for attempted murder was, whether one thing or the other, as long as the sentence in the relation to the murder persists. MR FITZGERALD: Our argument is this. If in fact the sentence of 12 years was too long, and for reasons already stated evidence of depression was not there at the time of the trial, then it should be reduced in any event as a matter of justice. If it is too long, it should be cut down. It is not academic because if it comes down then that is a powerful case, albeit the conviction stays in place, that shows that the rejection of the conviction appeal does not mean that there are not mitigating circumstances which have seen the light of day and should be taken into account. MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: Presumably the tariff was fixed at a time when the appellant was still maintaining that she was not responsible for the events. Of course all the medical evidence can be used in whatever way you, as her advisors, think appropriate. MR FITZGERALD: Clearly that is one of the most important matters we wish to establish. If the attempted murder sentence is too long because it failed to take account of factors which are now available then, in our respectful submission, it should be reduced. I accept, of course, that your Lordships can take into account the exercise of your discretion, the fact that there is this, as it were, supervening event of the conviction of murder. For example in the case of Batty , (1984) Cr App R, there was a conviction for murder of an Indian diplomat and, at the same time, for false imprisonment of that diplomat. The Court of Appeal heard an appeal against the sentence for the false imprisonment and reduced it on the basis that if it was too long it should be reduced. The effect of a reduction might influence the Home Secretary in his approach to the tariff for murder. So what I am asking your Lordships to do is not without precedent. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Shall we look at it? MR FITZGERALD: It is 1984, Batty . MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: Speaking for myself, of course, this is a high risk strategy. Supposing we accept your submission that we should examine it and then reject your submissions, then what? MR FITZGERALD: One always runs that risk. MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: I hope I make my thoughts clear to you. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may be better to use what you have, than to deploy an argument which fails. MR JUSTICE BUTTERFIELD: That is what I am suggesting in a rather Delphic way. It is only a suggestion. MR FITZGERALD: I am aware that you are going to take the decision is relation to both matters. My Lord, can I put it this way? If you take the view that the supervening event renders it not in the interest of justice, then I will not persist. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think is very important that the further evidence should be available to the Secretary of State, that is a different matter altogether. It is not a matter over which we have control. MR FITZGERALD: I am grateful for that indication. Clearly new issues have arisen which may not go to the interests of justice in relation to the conviction. Your observations will, I am sure, carry weight with the Home Secretary. In those circumstances I will not take the matter further. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: In those circumstances we seemed to have cleared the ground, and the application as I understand is not being pursued any further; is that right, Mr Fitzgerald? MR FITZGERALD: It is. LORD JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you very much."

He had been convicted of murder by a jury on 22 May 2013. At the same time he was sentenced to a concurrent term of 7 years for his role in a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice to which he had pleaded guilty on the first day of trial. Following refusal by the single judge, he renews his application for leave to appeal against sentence and an extension of time of 3590 days (9 years and 309 days) in which to do so. On 14 October 2012, at around 5.45 am, the deceased (Piotr Kulinski) had been stabbed to death outside his home address in Carlisle as he had been leaving for work. Mr Kulinski had been stabbed seven times, four times in the back, once to the front of his leg, once to the buttock area, which caused a deep wound to his anus, and once to the back of the leg. Mr Kulinski's partner had witnessed the end of the incident and had seen two males (Piotr Zygner and the applicant) attacking Mr Kulinski. Some 2 weeks previously Mr Kulinski had made an anonymous 999 call to the police, in which he had stated that Piotr Zygner, the applicant and others were members of a criminal gang that had been causing problems within the Polish community in Carlisle and that the previous day Mr Kulinski had been struck from behind by Mr Zygner who had been carrying a screwdriver, which had caused a minor wound to his back. The Crown's case was that it had been Mr Zygner who had stabbed the deceased and that the applicant went to the scene with the full knowledge that Piotr Zygner had a weapon and that he was going to use it on Mr Kulinski intending to kill him. Others had helped Mr Zygner and the applicant flee the scene and dispose of important evidence, including blood-stained clothing and the murder weapon. The applicant was subsequently arrested for the index offending. In subsequent interviews, he denied any knowledge or involvement in the offending and initially put forward an alibi. He later accepted that he was there, but denied killing anyone and denied knowledge of the knife or knowledge that the wounds would be or had been fatal. The defence at trial appears to have been that the deceased had tried to attack the applicant's co-accused Mr Zygner with a knife. The deceased had been disarmed by Zygner and that the applicant had not himself used the knife and he was merely acting in defence of his co-accused. The delay in bringing the application is explained by the negative advice on appeal against sentence, received from his counsel at the time. But now that the applicant sees other inmates who, in his opinion, have committed more serious murders as principals, he realises that his sentence was manifestly excessive. The grounds of appeal advanced are firstly that he should have been sentenced on the basis of manslaughter, not murder given his role in the enterprise which was only protecting his co-accused; secondly, that insufficient account was taken of the applicant's previous good character and employment record; and, thirdly, that the sentence overlooked that the deceased had been abusive towards the applicant and his sister in the past. In further letters of 28 December 2023 and 28 June 2024, in which the applicant sets out more detail to the grounds of appeal, he also advances further mitigation, that custody has been particularly harsh as both his sister and grandfather have died whilst he has been in prison. The sentencing judge, who had the benefit of hearing all the evidence as trial judge, was best placed to interpret the jury's conviction. He clearly set out in his sentencing remarks, which were based on the evidence at trial, that the applicant had played a full and active part in the stabbing although not himself having held the knife. There was significant premeditation and planning by both the applicant and Zygner to lie in wait for the deceased outside his home as he left for work at 5.40 am on a Sunday morning. The applicant went to the scene with full knowledge that his housemate and co-defendant Mr Zygner had a knife with him in order to stab the deceased. A getaway car was ready to take both assailants away from the scene. It was a murderous attack on a defenceless man in a quiet cul-de-sac in a residential part of the city of Carlisle. The deceased was stabbed seven times by the applicant's co-accused, including the deep wound to his anus as he lay dying which the judge described as a gratuitous piece of savagery intended to cause extreme pain and humiliation. The attack continued even after the deceased's partner remonstrated with the assailants through the window of her house and told them that she would be calling the police. Although the applicant did not himself do the stabbing, he played a full and active part and although he did not share Zygner's intent to kill, which lowered his culpability, it was still a serious offence. But the applicant had himself punched and kicked the victim, as he lay on his back dying and even after the deceased's partner had screamed at him to stop. The violence of his punches was noted by the independent eyewitness. The judge accepted that the victim had previously been involved in a feud with the applicant and Mr Zygner but accepted the evidence from a number of witnesses that he wanted to put the past behind him and lead a law-abiding life for the sake of his family and his 4-year-old son. He found that the victim was murdered because he was trying to stand up to the applicant and Mr Zygner's gang. He had previously been stabbed by Zygner with a screwdriver, which he had reported to the police anonymously. The judge correctly noted that the starting point for the calculation of the minimum term was 25 years under the applicable law at the time (paragraph 5A of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003). He further noted the aggravating features of the significant planning and premeditation and the additional offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice which the judge considered was extremely serious and included recruiting a host of others to assist in the destruction of incriminating evidence. He also noted the mitigating factors applicable to the applicant: the lack of intention that the victim would die; the fact that he had not wielded the knife or used a weapon other than his shod foot; the fact that in times past the applicant and his sister had been subjected to violence from the deceased. He noted the applicant's relative young age at 23 and that he was the youngest of the group. He also took into account the lack of any previous convictions and his employment record. He made an overall downward adjustment of 3 years to arrive at a final sentence of 22 years. Turning to the grounds of appeal. The difficulty for the applicant is that the jury rejected his defence that he was acting in the defence of Zygner and it is not now possible for him to go behind the jury's verdict in an appeal against sentence. The judge accepted that, unlike Zygner, the applicant did not intend to kill the deceased and that enabled the judge to make some detection to the starting point but he specifically found that the applicant had intended some really serious harm to the deceased from the knife that he knew Zygner had taken to the scene. The judge sentenced, correctly, in accordance with the jury's verdict, which it had been safe for them to reach. The judge also expressly took into account the applicant's mitigation and the points that were made in his favour. Given the identified aggravating features, the arrival at a final sentence of 3 years below the starting point, to take account of the mitigating features, it is not reasonably arguable that the sentence was manifestly excessive on the grounds advanced by the applicant. Although not raised as a ground of appeal by the applicant who is unrepresented, during the course of the preparation for hearing, it was noted by the Court of Appeal office lawyers that the minimum term was not properly announced nor indeed calculated as required by the provision which then applied (section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003) at the time of sentence. The applicant was entitled to receive credit for the 217 days on which he was remanded in custody prior to his conviction. He should have been informed that the minimum term was 21 years and 148 days. The Court has recently affirmed in R v Cookson and R v Sesay that the minimum term must be calculated having taken into account time served which cannot lawfully be carried out administratively if calculations are incorrect. Although we understand that the Prison Service have informed the applicant of the correct figures, namely 21 years and 148 days, it is necessary for us to correct the pronouncement of the minimum term to give it lawful effect. The imposition of a sentence which is inadvertently 217 days longer than intended by the judge is manifestly excessive and it is therefore in accordance with the interests of justice to grant an extension of time to allow the appeal on this limited ground to be considered. We therefore grant leave to the applicant to appeal out of time, on the limited ground that the judge failed to calculate the days spent remanded in custody when pronouncing sentence, and the appeal is allowed to the extent only that we declare that the minimum term was 21 years and 148 days.

In addition, certain complaints had been made as to a procedural and disclosure matter which had occurred during trial. However, those particular complaints have not been pursued formally as a renewed ground of appeal today, the single judge having rejected that ground on the papers. Background Facts The background position is this. On 26 April 2018, after a trial in the Crown Court at Mold before Lewis J and a jury, the appellant was convicted of murder. In due course he was sentenced to life imprisonment, as required by law. The judge specified a minimum term of 26 years less time spent on remand in custody. There had been a co-accused at the trial, a man called David Woods. On the fourth day of trial, after the opening speech of the prosecution and after some aspects of the prosecution evidence had been adduced, he pleaded guilty to the count of murder. He had previously also pleaded guilty to a count of doing an act intending to pervert the course of public justice. He having pleaded guilty during the trial to the count of murder, the judge formally required the jury to convict him, which they did. Woods was himself sentenced to custody for life and in his case a period of 27 years less time spent on remand in custody was set by the judge. The background facts, very briefly summarised for present purposes, are these. On 29 May 2017 Matthew Cassidy, who was aged 19, was stabbed in the stairwell of a block of flats in Connah's Quay. It was likely, given the evidence, that he was initially stabbed on the ground floor and was then chased by his assailants into the building and up the stairs. He was stabbed at least nine times, with the fatal knife injury penetrating his heart causing internal bleeding. There were no eyewitnesses to the fatal attack. However, two men had been seen by a neighbour leaving the block moments before the deceased was found. Woods was arrested on 1 June 2017. He provided a prepared statement denying any involvement in the murder. He was charged with murder and remanded into custody at HMP Altcourse. He then became the subject of covert surveillance. In the course of conversations in which he participated whilst in custody, as recorded, the first being on 12 June 2017, he made admissions that he had been involved in the murder. He also, however, made statements which implicated the appellant. Later, during that summer, Woods contacted the police stating that he had evidence that would show that it was the appellant who had committed the murder; and he provided a telephone purporting to show calls made by the appellant which would indeed incriminate the appellant. However, subsequent forensic examination revealed that that telephone evidence had in fact been fabricated at the behest of Woods. That was to lead to the count relating to perverting the course of justice. So far as the appellant was concerned, he was arrested on 24 June 2017. He at that stage provided a prepared statement denying that he had been involved in the murder. He was released on bail but was re-arrested on 10 October 2017 and was then charged with murder. In interview, he admitted that he had seen Woods on the night in question. He said that that was at the address of a woman called Tinson, where a number of people had assembled in order to purchase drugs. He said that he had been buying drugs from Woods. He said that Woods had been injured to his hand (as indeed he had been) and had admitted stabbing ""the lad"". The appellant was also to say that he himself had been to the block of flats a number of times in the past. The trial The trial started on 11 April 2018. The prosecution was represented, then as now, by Mr Paul Lewis QC, leading Ms Owen. In the course of his lengthy opening speech, Mr Lewis made express and quite extensive reference to the covert recordings of Woods whilst in prison. At that stage the jury bundles also included transcripts of the recorded conversations in which Woods had, among other things, purportedly implicated the appellant in the murder. Furthermore, Mr Lewis made brief reference to the defence case statement of Woods which was to similar effect. The prosecution case was that the two men seen leaving the block were the appellant and his co-accused, Woods. The motive for the attack lay in a dispute about the sale of Class A drugs in the local area, Cassidy being identified as being involved in drug dealing in the local community. In effect this had been the upshot of a turf war. There was undoubtedly extremely strong evidence against Woods. That included CCTV footage of his movements, telephone call data linking him to drug dealing and to other significant parties, and DNA material linking him to knives which had been used in the attack and which had been subsequently retrieved. There also was, amongst other things, evidence showing his efforts to obtain hospital treatment at the time for injuries to his hand. So far as the case against the appellant was concerned (and again for present purposes we put it very shortly) the prosecution in particular relied upon CCTV footage showing the movements of both the deceased and Woods, evidence of a man called Wright about purchasing drugs from Woods and descriptions of him, and the eyewitness evidence of the neighbour, a Mr Power, indicating that two men had been seen leaving the scene. Further, reliance was placed on scientific evidence providing ""moderately strong"" support for a link between a pair of the appellant's trainers and footwear marks in the blood and mud left at the scene. Further, DNA material had been recovered from the upper surface of the trainers that matched with the DNA of his co-accused, Woods. There was also CCTV footage showing that the appellant was in the area close to the flats where the murder took place. Further there was CCTV footage showing the appellant returning to his mother's home almost immediately after the incident and emerging twice from that home having changed his clothing on both occasions. The defence case, in a nutshell, was that the appellant had not been present or involved in the attack on the deceased by Woods. It was unsurprising that his movements were in the locality, because that is the locality where he lived. As for the change of clothing, that was because it had been raining heavily and he had become wet. He had seen Woods after the assault and had bought drugs from him; and that would explain the DNA material on his shoe linking him to Woods. Further, it was said that Woods had been boasting at Ms Tinson's house about how he, Woods, had ""done him"". Moreover, the neighbour's description of the two men, whilst reasonably accurate so far as Wood was concerned, so far from identifying the appellant as being one of the men in fact contained positive and significant discrepancies between the man that Mr Power had described and the actual appearance of the appellant. Indeed Mr Power never claimed to have seen either of the two men from the front. Moreover, the defence were in a position to point out that there was no DNA evidence of any kind linking the appellant to the deceased or to the knives or to the scene of the killing. A submission of no case to answer was made at the end of the prosecution case. That was rejected by the judge; and no challenge to that decision of the judge to reject the submission of no case to answer has (understandably) been pursued by way of appeal, although Mr Harrington QC (appearing then, as now, for the appellant) has asserted to us that the case was not a strong one. The jury thus were left to decide whether the appellant had been present and participated in the attack on the deceased with the necessary intent. The appellant himself gave evidence setting out his own position in some detail. He was to say, amongst other things, that he had not known Cassidy and had never heard of him. He entirely denied having anything to do with the killing of Cassidy. He also described how, amongst other things, at the subsequent meeting with Woods and the other drug users Woods had a tea towel wrapped round his hand which was bleeding and how Woods had told him that he had been slashed when he had ""done someone"". The defence therefore was one of denial of presence and of involvement. It is plain, however, from the verdict of the jury that the jury had not believed the evidence of the appellant and had been made sure of guilt on the evidence presented by the prosecution. There, it might be thought, matters would have rested. The responsibility of deciding on guilt was that of the jury and the jury; had shown what they had made of the evidence by the verdict which they pronounced. However, complaint is made as to the judge's directions as a result of what happened after Woods had pleaded guilty on the fourth day of trial. What is said is that the judge failed sufficiently to instruct the jury as to what they were to do with the statements which had been made in open court prior to Wood's guilty plea. As we have said, Mr Lewis, in his opening speech, had made quite extensive reference to the transcripts of the conversations as recorded on the part of Woods whilst in prison: and part of those transcripts indicated comments by Woods that the appellant had been implicated in the killing of Cassidy. The position was this. When Woods indicated his change of plea there was consideration, inevitably, as to what would then ensue. Mr Lewis, very fairly, informed Mr Harrington at the time that he would not oppose any application for discharge the jury and for a retrial. The judge himself had made preliminary enquiries in this respect and it was indicated that a fresh jury panel could be convened in Mold Crown Court for the following day. However, having considered the position, the defence team (with the concurrence of the appellant) took the decision, a tactical decision, that no application to discharge would be made. The trial accordingly proceeded as against the appellant alone, in front of the same jury. One factor, as Mr Harrington has told us, which influenced that decision was that the behaviour of Woods thus far during the trial had apparently been appalling. That may well have caused the jury not at all to associate themselves with his position and it was considered that that might in turn redound to the advantage of the appellant - a perfectly understandable tactical consideration. We will come on in a moment to what else seems to have prompted the defence team's thinking. At all events, the matter had been discussed with the judge in the absence of the jury. He was told that there was no application to discharge. By the following morning all the materials, relating to Woods, including transcripts of what Woods had said in prison and the Defence Case Statement, had been removed from the jury bundle. The judge then addressed the jury in the following way: ""Well good morning members of the Jury, thanks again for being so prompt. We are now ready to continue with this trial. As you know you found Mr Woods guilty yesterday, but the Co-Defendant, Mr Leslie Baines, is still in your charge and we have to continue the trial that we have already started. We'll carry on now with the evidence. You may notice that some of the material in the bundle that you had has been removed because they related to Mr Woods and they do not relate to Mr Baines, so we have taken that out. So if you are wondering why there are gaps that is the reason why. The index will be amended in due course. So now we are ready to carry on with the evidence in trial of Mr Baines ..."" No one requested the judge to say anything more than that at that stage and no further or supplemental direction was requested by counsel to be given by the judge. The trial then proceeded. In the course of his closing speech to the jury Mr Harrington then made an allusion to the appellant having first come under suspicion on 12 June 2017 as a result of the recorded conversation of Woods. As we gather, Mr Harrington had not explained in advance to judge or prosecution that he had been proposing to make this reference in this way as he did. In the absence of the jury, Mr Lewis then made objection to what Mr Harrington had said. First, in point of fact, the appellant had come under suspicion on 1 June and not only after the 12 June. Secondly, objection was made that Mr Harrington, in saying what he had said, had relied on matters which were in truth not in evidence: because at no stage during the trial had the recorded telephone conversations of Woods been adduced in evidence before the jury. Indeed, the transcripts had been entirely removed from the jury bundle and, rightly, those conversations had not been referred thereafter in evidence. This matter having been raised before the judge there was then some detailed discussion. Ultimately, a form of wording was agreed between judge and counsel. The judge, faithful to that form of wording as agreed, then when he came to sum-up on the evidence towards the end of his summing-up included this passage in the agreed form: ""Finally, Mr Harrington also made submissions to you saying that Mr Baines was not a suspect in the police investigation into the murder of Mr Cassidy until such time as David Woods mentioned Mr Baines' name to his family and friends during conversations that were covertly recorded in prison visits at HMP Altcourse. Mr Harrington also said that thereafter Mr Baines only became a suspect because of what David Woods had then said about him. In making those submissions, Mr Harrington was in error. It is accepted by everyone that Mr Harrington submissions, although wrong, were inadvertent and were made in good faith. Nonetheless, it is important that the position is corrected and you do not proceed to consider the evidence upon an erroneous basis. So, that members of the Jury, is the summary of the main points of the evidence."" The judge then made some brief concluding remarks and the jury retired. A few minutes after the jury retired they sent in a note. This was, quite rightly, discussed by the judge with counsel. The question in the note was as follows: ""Is the conversation reported in Altcourse, of David Woods, available in evidence?"" The judge having read that out to counsel, the judge's comment was ""and the answer is no"": with which Mr Harrington and Mr Lewis agreed. The judge then said: ""Because it is not. So I will just say, no, no they have heard all the evidence. And that was not in evidence, so the answer is no. OK, do you want to bring the jury in..."" No further direction was suggested to the judge as being appropriate and no supplement to what he had indicated that he would say was requested. In fact, the judge went a little further than what he had just said because when the jury came in the judge said this. Having referred to the note and set out its terms, he then went on: ""And the answer is, no, it is not. It is, as you probably knew, it was not adduced in evidence, and you have simply got to go on the evidence that you have heard in this Court. But thank you for sending me the note, but the answer is, no, it is not in evidence. And now you go back and carry on your deliberations."" In the result, as we have said, the jury convicted. Grounds of Appeal As part of his background complaints, Mr Harrington had to some extent protested about the procedure that had been adopted with regard to identifying precisely when the appellant had first come under suspicion. At one stage he seemed to criticise the prosecution for not having given disclosure prior to trial of the date on which the appellant first came under suspicion, although he has throughout always been moderate in any criticism which might be made. However, we agree with Mr Lewis that there was no failure on the part of the prosecution in this regard, of any kind, and there is no criticism available. The date on which the appellant first came under suspicion was not a matter which of itself would tend to advance the defence case or undermine the prosecution case. Mr Lewis further said, and of course we accept it, that had the defence only asked, at any stage, about the time at which the appellant had first come under suspicion then of course the defence would have been told. But no such request was made; and Mr Harrington said what he said in his closing speech, as Mr Lewis submitted, simply on the mistaken assumption that suspicion had first fallen on the appellant on or after the 12 June, without first checking that with the prosecution. In those circumstances there can in our view be no criticism of the procedure which the judge adopted. Some complaint was, however, made as to the ensuing discussion with and disclosure to the judge (in the absence of the jury) with regard to the date on which the appellant first came under suspicion. It is sufficient to say that all that happened was done openly; the judge was at no stage incorrectly informed as to the correct date on which the appellant first came under suspicion; and no injustice of any kind was occasioned to the defence by the way in which the matter was - relatively informally - dealt with, in the absence of the jury, by the judge. Indeed, as we have said, it resulted in the judge giving a further direction to the jury in the summing up in agreed form. Before us today Mr Harrington has placed considerable emphasis on what he says is the impact of this point upon the defence's prior decision not to seek a discharge of the jury. He has said that had the defence team appreciated from the outset that the suspicion had fallen on the appellant on the 1 June 2017, that would have influenced them in deciding to seek the discharge of the jury; and it is more than likely that such an application, if made, would have been acceded to by the trial judge. He says that a wrong decision on the part of the defence in this regard was made; and that should not be visited upon the appellant himself. With all respect, we do not think that that is a point now open to the appellant. The tactical decision was made at the time not to seek to discharge the jury. One reason for that given, namely the manner and demeanour of Woods during the trial, was an entirely understandable part of the thinking. But Mr Harrington has sought to say that another part of that thinking was the perception of the defence that they could make something out of the fact, as they thought it was, that the police had only felt they had a potential case against the appellant as a result of what Woods had said in prison and where Woods plainly was now identified as a man whose word could not be relied upon in any respect. With respect, we do not think that would have been a legitimate line of reasoning. What Woods had said in prison could only be material if it was in evidence. It was not in evidence. True it was that it had been referred to by Mr Lewis in his opening speech. But Mr Lewis had at the time made clear, as the judge also subsequently made clear in a general direction in the summing up, that nothing that counsel said in speeches was evidence. The trial throughout certainly was conducted on the footing, quite rightly, that those conversations never became evidence. It follows, therefore, that it is difficult to comprehend how it was that such conversations in prison could be used as a basis for influencing the decision whether or not to apply for a discharge. In fact, since they were not in evidence Mr Harrington strictly could and should not subsequently have relied upon them or referred to them at all in his closing speech: precisely the point about which Mr Lewis, understandably, complained at the time. At all events, if this perception of matters did impact upon the defence decision not to seek a discharge, that was simply one of the consequences of the stance that they took. But in it certainly was not through any misleading by the Crown; and, on the contrary, this was simply based on the defence's own assessment of the position. This court cannot go behind a tactical decision not to apply for a discharge at this stage in those circumstances. It would be wrong in principle to do so. In any event, if it be relevant, just because the jury subsequently convicted does not mean that the decision necessarily was a wrong one. We should also add that to the extent that Mr Harrington frankly engaged in a degree of self-criticism in this regard he confirmed to us, on our query, that he has felt able to continue to act on this appeal and that his client had confirmed his instructions to do so. The actual ground on which leave was granted and which has been pursued before us nevertheless focuses on the way in which the judge dealt with the matter once Woods had pleaded guilty. We have already set out what the judge said to the jury at the time when the relevant documents relating to Woods had been removed from the jury bundle. As we see it, whilst some judges perhaps might have said more, the judge said enough at that stage. It is also noteworthy that no one requested him to give any more detail in his remarks to the jury at that stage. We add that Mr Lewis in his opening speech, during which he had made extensive reference to the transcripts of the phone conservations as recorded of Woods whilst in prison, had himself also stated to the jury the (correct) proposition in law that anything said by one defendant in the absence of another defendant could not count as evidence against that other defendant. True it is that that was an observation from the Bar and not from the Bench; nevertheless, the fact is that that the jury had themselves been so told at that time. Thereafter, when the judge came to sum-up, quite properly the judge made no reference to the contents of the telephone conservations until he came to the stage where he had to correct Mr Harrington's inadvertent mistake. On the contrary, in the earlier part of his summing-up, the judge had made quite clear that the jury were to focus only on the evidence before them. He also said this: ""Now, as I explained at paragraph 11, there is no direct evidence here that Mr Baines committed the crime that he is charged with. There is no evidence from an eyewitness saying they saw him do it and there is no evidence that he confessed to the crime so what the Prosecution rely on is what is sometimes referred to as circumstantial evidence."" A little later on the judge said: ""As I say, you must decide this case only on the evidence that has been put before you in this trial, there is not going to be any more evidence."" The judge, we add, had also given the jury detailed directions in law in writing and had given them a detailed written route to verdict. So the jury were left quite clear by the summing-up, if they had not already been clear, firstly, that there was no direct evidence against the appellant and secondly, that the jury could only rely upon the evidence adduced before them in court. No criticism, in those circumstances, can be made of the summing-up in not saying more about the status of the telephone conversations of Woods; indeed it was entirely sensible and right that the judge should have steered clear of that to avoid drawing attention to a point which was not in evidence. The only occasion on which the judge referred to it was one which he necessarily was required to deal with, namely the correction of leading counsel's closing speech. It is in fact rather ironic that this criticism now made of the judge for failing to instruct the jury more specifically that such recorded conversations could not be relied upon at all as evidence against the appellant only arose because of defence counsel's own attempts to refer to such conversations in his closing speech. Mr Harrington says: well that may be so, but the fact of the jury note, put in so shortly after they retired, showed that the jury may still be under a misapprehension and the point needed sorting out with the utmost clarity and specificity. We think it is in fact likely that the jury put in that note as and when they did just because the judge had been required towards the end of his summing up to refer to the conversations of Woods in the passage correcting what Mr Harrington had said in his closing speech. But the point remains that the jury were seeking confirmation in effect as to whether or not those conversations were available as evidence; and they were told absolutely specifically by the judge that they were not. The jury could have been under no illusion to the contrary. In such circumstances, we do not accept Mr Harrington's submission that the jury may have relied on inadmissible materials and that the conviction is unsafe accordingly. In our view the judge had said entirely sufficient to make the position clear: and it is also noteworthy that neither counsel had asked him to say more. The jury would thus have well known that those conversations were not to be regarded as any form of evidence available to them to take into account in their consideration of the case against the appellant. In such circumstances, whilst it may be that some judges might perhaps have said a little more at the first stage when this arose (that is to say, when Woods had pleaded guilty), the judge was not required to say at that time more than he did. The point thereafter was in any event put beyond doubt by the way in which he dealt with the jury note. In such circumstances, we do not see any basis for the various points and grounds of appeal advanced before us, skilfully and eloquently though they were put by Mr Harrington. We see no reason, overall, to doubt the safety of the conviction. The jury were not misdirected in any way. They, having heard the evidence, did not believe the evidence of the appellant and did accept the case of the prosecution. Conclusion We therefore dismiss this appeal.

He entirely denied having anything to do with the killing of Cassidy. He also described how, amongst other things, at the subsequent meeting with Woods and the other drug users Woods had a tea towel wrapped round his hand which was bleeding and how Woods had told him that he had been slashed when he had ""done someone"". The defence therefore was one of denial of presence and of involvement. It is plain, however, from the verdict of the jury that the jury had not believed the evidence of the appellant and had been made sure of guilt on the evidence presented by the prosecution. There, it might be thought, matters would have rested. The responsibility of deciding on guilt was that of the jury and the jury; had shown what they had made of the evidence by the verdict which they pronounced. However, complaint is made as to the judge's directions as a result of what happened after Woods had pleaded guilty on the fourth day of trial. What is said is that the judge failed sufficiently to instruct the jury as to what they were to do with the statements which had been made in open court prior to Wood's guilty plea. As we have said, Mr Lewis, in his opening speech, had made quite extensive reference to the transcripts of the conversations as recorded on the part of Woods whilst in prison: and part of those transcripts indicated comments by Woods that the appellant had been implicated in the killing of Cassidy. The position was this. When Woods indicated his change of plea there was consideration, inevitably, as to what would then ensue. Mr Lewis, very fairly, informed Mr Harrington at the time that he would not oppose any application for discharge the jury and for a retrial. The judge himself had made preliminary enquiries in this respect and it was indicated that a fresh jury panel could be convened in Mold Crown Court for the following day. However, having considered the position, the defence team (with the concurrence of the appellant) took the decision, a tactical decision, that no application to discharge would be made. The trial accordingly proceeded as against the appellant alone, in front of the same jury. One factor, as Mr Harrington has told us, which influenced that decision was that the behaviour of Woods thus far during the trial had apparently been appalling. That may well have caused the jury not at all to associate themselves with his position and it was considered that that might in turn redound to the advantage of the appellant - a perfectly understandable tactical consideration. We will come on in a moment to what else seems to have prompted the defence team's thinking. At all events, the matter had been discussed with the judge in the absence of the jury. He was told that there was no application to discharge. By the following morning all the materials, relating to Woods, including transcripts of what Woods had said in prison and the Defence Case Statement, had been removed from the jury bundle. The judge then addressed the jury in the following way: ""Well good morning members of the Jury, thanks again for being so prompt. We are now ready to continue with this trial. As you know you found Mr Woods guilty yesterday, but the Co-Defendant, Mr Leslie Baines, is still in your charge and we have to continue the trial that we have already started. We'll carry on now with the evidence. You may notice that some of the material in the bundle that you had has been removed because they related to Mr Woods and they do not relate to Mr Baines, so we have taken that out. So if you are wondering why there are gaps that is the reason why. The index will be amended in due course. So now we are ready to carry on with the evidence in trial of Mr Baines ..."" No one requested the judge to say anything more than that at that stage and no further or supplemental direction was requested by counsel to be given by the judge. The trial then proceeded. In the course of his closing speech to the jury Mr Harrington then made an allusion to the appellant having first come under suspicion on 12 June 2017 as a result of the recorded conversation of Woods. As we gather, Mr Harrington had not explained in advance to judge or prosecution that he had been proposing to make this reference in this way as he did. In the absence of the jury, Mr Lewis then made objection to what Mr Harrington had said. First, in point of fact, the appellant had come under suspicion on 1 June and not only after the 12 June. Secondly, objection was made that Mr Harrington, in saying what he had said, had relied on matters which were in truth not in evidence: because at no stage during the trial had the recorded telephone conversations of Woods been adduced in evidence before the jury. Indeed, the transcripts had been entirely removed from the jury bundle and, rightly, those conversations had not been referred thereafter in evidence. This matter having been raised before the judge there was then some detailed discussion. Ultimately, a form of wording was agreed between judge and counsel. The judge, faithful to that form of wording as agreed, then when he came to sum-up on the evidence towards the end of his summing-up included this passage in the agreed form: ""Finally, Mr Harrington also made submissions to you saying that Mr Baines was not a suspect in the police investigation into the murder of Mr Cassidy until such time as David Woods mentioned Mr Baines' name to his family and friends during conversations that were covertly recorded in prison visits at HMP Altcourse. Mr Harrington also said that thereafter Mr Baines only became a suspect because of what David Woods had then said about him. In making those submissions, Mr Harrington was in error. It is accepted by everyone that Mr Harrington submissions, although wrong, were inadvertent and were made in good faith. Nonetheless, it is important that the position is corrected and you do not proceed to consider the evidence upon an erroneous basis. So, that members of the Jury, is the summary of the main points of the evidence."" The judge then made some brief concluding remarks and the jury retired. A few minutes after the jury retired they sent in a note. This was, quite rightly, discussed by the judge with counsel. The question in the note was as follows: ""Is the conversation reported in Altcourse, of David Woods, available in evidence?"" The judge having read that out to counsel, the judge's comment was ""and the answer is no"": with which Mr Harrington and Mr Lewis agreed. The judge then said: ""Because it is not. So I will just say, no, no they have heard all the evidence. And that was not in evidence, so the answer is no. OK, do you want to bring the jury in..."" No further direction was suggested to the judge as being appropriate and no supplement to what he had indicated that he would say was requested. In fact, the judge went a little further than what he had just said because when the jury came in the judge said this. Having referred to the note and set out its terms, he then went on: ""And the answer is, no, it is not. It is, as you probably knew, it was not adduced in evidence, and you have simply got to go on the evidence that you have heard in this Court. But thank you for sending me the note, but the answer is, no, it is not in evidence. And now you go back and carry on your deliberations."" In the result, as we have said, the jury convicted. Grounds of Appeal As part of his background complaints, Mr Harrington had to some extent protested about the procedure that had been adopted with regard to identifying precisely when the appellant had first come under suspicion. At one stage he seemed to criticise the prosecution for not having given disclosure prior to trial of the date on which the appellant first came under suspicion, although he has throughout always been moderate in any criticism which might be made. However, we agree with Mr Lewis that there was no failure on the part of the prosecution in this regard, of any kind, and there is no criticism available. The date on which the appellant first came under suspicion was not a matter which of itself would tend to advance the defence case or undermine the prosecution case. Mr Lewis further said, and of course we accept it, that had the defence only asked, at any stage, about the time at which the appellant had first come under suspicion then of course the defence would have been told. But no such request was made; and Mr Harrington said what he said in his closing speech, as Mr Lewis submitted, simply on the mistaken assumption that suspicion had first fallen on the appellant on or after the 12 June, without first checking that with the prosecution. In those circumstances there can in our view be no criticism of the procedure which the judge adopted. Some complaint was, however, made as to the ensuing discussion with and disclosure to the judge (in the absence of the jury) with regard to the date on which the appellant first came under suspicion. It is sufficient to say that all that happened was done openly; the judge was at no stage incorrectly informed as to the correct date on which the appellant first came under suspicion; and no injustice of any kind was occasioned to the defence by the way in which the matter was - relatively informally - dealt with, in the absence of the jury, by the judge. Indeed, as we have said, it resulted in the judge giving a further direction to the jury in the summing up in agreed form. Before us today Mr Harrington has placed considerable emphasis on what he says is the impact of this point upon the defence's prior decision not to seek a discharge of the jury. He has said that had the defence team appreciated from the outset that the suspicion had fallen on the appellant on the 1 June 2017, that would have influenced them in deciding to seek the discharge of the jury; and it is more than likely that such an application, if made, would have been acceded to by the trial judge. He says that a wrong decision on the part of the defence in this regard was made; and that should not be visited upon the appellant himself. With all respect, we do not think that that is a point now open to the appellant. The tactical decision was made at the time not to seek to discharge the jury. One reason for that given, namely the manner and demeanour of Woods during the trial, was an entirely understandable part of the thinking. But Mr Harrington has sought to say that another part of that thinking was the perception of the defence that they could make something out of the fact, as they thought it was, that the police had only felt they had a potential case against the appellant as a result of what Woods had said in prison and where Woods plainly was now identified as a man whose word could not be relied upon in any respect. With respect, we do not think that would have been a legitimate line of reasoning. What Woods had said in prison could only be material if it was in evidence. It was not in evidence. True it was that it had been referred to by Mr Lewis in his opening speech. But Mr Lewis had at the time made clear, as the judge also subsequently made clear in a general direction in the summing up, that nothing that counsel said in speeches was evidence. The trial throughout certainly was conducted on the footing, quite rightly, that those conversations never became evidence. It follows, therefore, that it is difficult to comprehend how it was that such conversations in prison could be used as a basis for influencing the decision whether or not to apply for a discharge. In fact, since they were not in evidence Mr Harrington strictly could and should not subsequently have relied upon them or referred to them at all in his closing speech: precisely the point about which Mr Lewis, understandably, complained at the time. At all events, if this perception of matters did impact upon the defence decision not to seek a discharge, that was simply one of the consequences of the stance that they took. But in it certainly was not through any misleading by the Crown; and, on the contrary, this was simply based on the defence's own assessment of the position. This court cannot go behind a tactical decision not to apply for a discharge at this stage in those circumstances. It would be wrong in principle to do so. In any event, if it be relevant, just because the jury subsequently convicted does not mean that the decision necessarily was a wrong one. We should also add that to the extent that Mr Harrington frankly engaged in a degree of self-criticism in this regard he confirmed to us, on our query, that he has felt able to continue to act on this appeal and that his client had confirmed his instructions to do so. The actual ground on which leave was granted and which has been pursued before us nevertheless focuses on the way in which the judge dealt with the matter once Woods had pleaded guilty. We have already set out what the judge said to the jury at the time when the relevant documents relating to Woods had been removed from the jury bundle. As we see it, whilst some judges perhaps might have said more, the judge said enough at that stage. It is also noteworthy that no one requested him to give any more detail in his remarks to the jury at that stage. We add that Mr Lewis in his opening speech, during which he had made extensive reference to the transcripts of the phone conservations as recorded of Woods whilst in prison, had himself also stated to the jury the (correct) proposition in law that anything said by one defendant in the absence of another defendant could not count as evidence against that other defendant. True it is that that was an observation from the Bar and not from the Bench; nevertheless, the fact is that that the jury had themselves been so told at that time. Thereafter, when the judge came to sum-up, quite properly the judge made no reference to the contents of the telephone conservations until he came to the stage where he had to correct Mr Harrington's inadvertent mistake. On the contrary, in the earlier part of his summing-up, the judge had made quite clear that the jury were to focus only on the evidence before them. He also said this: ""Now, as I explained at paragraph 11, there is no direct evidence here that Mr Baines committed the crime that he is charged with. There is no evidence from an eyewitness saying they saw him do it and there is no evidence that he confessed to the crime so what the Prosecution rely on is what is sometimes referred to as circumstantial evidence."" A little later on the judge said: ""As I say, you must decide this case only on the evidence that has been put before you in this trial, there is not going to be any more evidence."" The judge, we add, had also given the jury detailed directions in law in writing and had given them a detailed written route to verdict. So the jury were left quite clear by the summing-up, if they had not already been clear, firstly, that there was no direct evidence against the appellant and secondly, that the jury could only rely upon the evidence adduced before them in court. No criticism, in those circumstances, can be made of the summing-up in not saying more about the status of the telephone conversations of Woods; indeed it was entirely sensible and right that the judge should have steered clear of that to avoid drawing attention to a point which was not in evidence. The only occasion on which the judge referred to it was one which he necessarily was required to deal with, namely the correction of leading counsel's closing speech. It is in fact rather ironic that this criticism now made of the judge for failing to instruct the jury more specifically that such recorded conversations could not be relied upon at all as evidence against the appellant only arose because of defence counsel's own attempts to refer to such conversations in his closing speech. Mr Harrington says: well that may be so, but the fact of the jury note, put in so shortly after they retired, showed that the jury may still be under a misapprehension and the point needed sorting out with the utmost clarity and specificity. We think it is in fact likely that the jury put in that note as and when they did just because the judge had been required towards the end of his summing up to refer to the conversations of Woods in the passage correcting what Mr Harrington had said in his closing speech. But the point remains that the jury were seeking confirmation in effect as to whether or not those conversations were available as evidence; and they were told absolutely specifically by the judge that they were not. The jury could have been under no illusion to the contrary. In such circumstances, we do not accept Mr Harrington's submission that the jury may have relied on inadmissible materials and that the conviction is unsafe accordingly. In our view the judge had said entirely sufficient to make the position clear: and it is also noteworthy that neither counsel had asked him to say more. The jury would thus have well known that those conversations were not to be regarded as any form of evidence available to them to take into account in their consideration of the case against the appellant. In such circumstances, whilst it may be that some judges might perhaps have said a little more at the first stage when this arose (that is to say, when Woods had pleaded guilty), the judge was not required to say at that time more than he did. The point thereafter was in any event put beyond doubt by the way in which he dealt with the jury note. In such circumstances, we do not see any basis for the various points and grounds of appeal advanced before us, skilfully and eloquently though they were put by Mr Harrington. We see no reason, overall, to doubt the safety of the conviction. The jury were not misdirected in any way. They, having heard the evidence, did not believe the evidence of the appellant and did accept the case of the prosecution. Conclusion We therefore dismiss this appeal."

(Approved) MR JUSTICE GOOSE: This is a renewed application for leave to appeal sentence, permission having been refused by the single judge, by Daniel Rogers, who is now aged 33. On 4 October 2012 in the Crown Court at Luton before His Honour Judge Foster, the applicant was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life, with a minimum term of 25 years, less time served on remand. The applicant seeks an extension of time of five years and four months so that he may make this application. The facts of this case can be summarised shortly. At the time of this offence the applicant was aged 27. After a disturbed night at home where his six-month-old daughter kept the applicant awake during the night, he went on a drinking binge, consuming numerous pints of lager and whisky at a number of pubs and clubs. By 5 o'clock in the morning on 22 January 2012 the applicant went to the offices of a taxi company to book a taxi. The deceased, who was aged 61, was the allocated driver for the applicant. He asked the applicant for payment in advance of the journey. He became abusive saying: ""I have enough money to buy all you Paki's."" The deceased tried to calm the applicant and was joined by a colleague who sought to explain why money was asked for in advance. The applicant repeated his racially abusive behaviour and followed the deceased into the taxi office. In the presence of others, the applicant assaulted the deceased by punching him and kicking him, including whilst he was on the floor. In a sustained and vicious attack, which was obviously racially aggravated, the applicant picked up a heavy office chair and brought it down onto the deceased before he ran off. The applicant was arrested near to the scene. He spat at paramedics who had offered to help him and insulted the police officers. In later interview he admitted the assault and was subsequently brought before the Magistrates' Court and pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Unfortunately, the deceased's injuries were more serious than had been anticipated. Seven days later he died from the consequences of a head injury caused during the assault. The applicant was convicted after a trial of murder. His defence had been on the contention that he was guilty of manslaughter alone. In sentencing the applicant, the trial judge had adopted a starting point of 30 years for the minimum term because this was a racially aggravated murder within the terms of paragraph 5(2)(g) of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. There is no dispute that this was the correct starting point for the applicant. The judge discounted the minimum term from 30 years to 25 years to take into account the significant mitigating factors in this case. In particular, that the applicant intended to cause grievous bodily harm and not to kill; that the racial aggravation itself fell towards the bottom end of the spectrum; that the applicant suffered from Tourette's Syndrome and associated Obsessional Compulsive Disorder (""OCD"") which, based on psychiatric evidence, caused the applicant considerable difficulties; that this offence was not premeditated and the applicant did not have a history of serious violence. The sentencing judge applied these significant mitigating factors to substantially reduce the minimum term by five years. It is argued on behalf of the applicant that a greater reduction should have been applied to the minimum term and that the judge failed to give proper regard to the sentence approved by the Court of Appeal in R v Murphy [2009] EWCA Crim. 2859. The single judge, in refusing permission to appeal, identified that the trial judge had taken into account the aggravating factors and all of the relevant mitigating factors to arrive at a minimum term of 25 years. The judge's reasoning and sentence could not be faulted. We have considered carefully the merits of this appeal and find ourselves in agreement with the single judge. Further, there is no merit in the argument that the sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the decision of this court in R v Murphy . This court finds no assistance in seeking to draw a comparison between that case and this one. These two cases are factually different, principally because the court in R v Murphy was dealing with an 18-year-old offender, whilst the applicant was 27 when he committed this offence of murder. Accordingly, we find no merit in this application for permission to appeal. Further, although we have read carefully the reasons offered by the applicant for the substantial delay in making this application, set out in his two letters received by the Court of Appeal office on 22 March 2018 and 7 January 2019, they do not provide sufficient or proper reason for a delay of five years and four months. Therefore, the application for an extension of time is refused, due to the lack of merit in the appeal and also in respect of the reason for delay.

JUSTICE McCULLOUGH ____________________ R E G I N A v. PAUL ANTHONY GRAHAM ____________________ (Transcript of the Shorthand Notes of Walsh, Cherer & Co. Ltd., 36/38, Whitefriars Street, Fleet Street, London, EC4Y 8BH. Telephone Number: 01-583 7635. Shorthand Writers to the Court). ____________________ MR. M. KENNEDY Q.C. and MR. A. TAYLOR appeared on behalf of the Appellant. MR. M. SHERRARD Q.C. and. MR. J. CURTIS appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT ____________________ Crown Copyright © ( As approved by Judge ) THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE : On 11th September 1980, at Maidstone Crown Court, the appellant was convicted of murder, before Purchas J. and a jury, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He now seeks to appeal against that conviction. The facts of the case were as follows. The appellant was the victim's husband. He is a practising homosexual. His wife was aware of this and indeed at the material time they were living in a bizarre menage a trois with another homosexual called King. There were living in the flat above two other homosexuals, named Gillis and Minter, with whom the appellant occasionally had sexual relations. The appellant and King were jointly charged with the murder. King pleaded guilty. The appellant admitted playing an active part in the events leading to the killing and admitted seeking to conceal the killing after it had happened. His defence was twofold. First, that he lacked the necessary intent, and he drew attention particularly to the drink and drugs he had taken; and, secondly, that whatever his intentional actions may have been, they were performed under duress because of his fear of King. We are satisfied that the directions given to the jury by the learned judge, on the issues of murder and manslaughter, on joint enterprise and on the relevance of drink and drugs to those issues, were impeccable. Other minor complaints made in the notice of appeal are also without foundation. The only live issue is, as Mr. Kennedy concedes, whether the direction to the jury on the question of duress was correct. The evidence relevant to this issue was this. The appellant had suffered for some time from an anxiety state. He was taking Valium tablets on prescription. There was medical evidence to the effect that valium, if taken in excess, would make him more susceptible to bullying, but that by mid-1980 he would have developed some tolerance to the drug. King was said to be a man of violence. There was evidence of altercations. In 1978 King had tipped the appellant and his wife off a settee because they were embracing and he was jealous. The appellant, it seems, knew of another incident in 1978 when some other woman had been assaulted by King and had had ribs broken. In June 1980, said the appellant, King had ""swiped him over the head"". On Friday, 27th June, 1980, the day before the killing, King attacked the wife with a knife. The appellant intervened and, for his trouble, cut his finger when he tried to grab the knife. As a result of this incident, the wife on the following day left and went to the appellant's mother's home. The appellant and King stayed behind and, together with the man Gillis, occupied their time in the flat drinking, talking and indulging in homosexual activities. The appellant said that he had a lot to drink during this time and had taken Valium tablets in excess of the quantity which had been prescribed for him. He also said that during the time that the three were together, he thought that King was going to attack him with a knife, but the incident came to nothing. Gillis left soon after midnight. King then suggested getting rid of the wife once and for all. The two of them hatched a plan. The appellant telephoned his wife in the small hours, told her falsely that he had cut his wrists and asked her to come home at once. Meanwhile, King bandaged both of the appellant' wrists and he, the appellant, lay face down on the floor pretending to be seriously hurt. When the wife arrived, she knelt down beside the appellant to see how he was. King had the flex from a coffee percolator in his hands. He attempted unsuccessfully to put it round the wife's neck while she was kneeling. The appellant and his wife then both got up and King said: ""What's it feel like to know that you are going to die, Betty?"" That remark was repeated. King then put the flex round the wife's neck and pulled it tight, hauling her off her feet onto his back as if she were a sack of coals. She put her hands up to the flex at her neck, whereupon King told the appellant to cut her fingers away. The appellant said in evidence that he picked up a knife but could not bring himself to use it. King thereupon put the wife on the floor, still holding the flex. He told the appellant to take hold of one end of it. The appellant said in evidence that he did so. He added that it was only in fear of King that he complied with the order. He said that, in any event, the plug at the end of the flex which he was holding came off as he exerted pressure on it. If that were the case, it would remain in doubt whether the appellant's act made any contribution to the death. It should, however, be noted that in the voluntary statement, which he made to the police, he had admitted pulling on the flex for about a minute. Whatever the precise sequence of events, it was beyond doubt that the ligature around the wife's neck was responsible for her death. Thereafter, the appellant helped King to dispose of her body by wrapping it up, carrying her out of the flat and dumping it over an embankment. Each of the two men then took one of her earrings; the appellant rifled her handbag for anything he could find of use, and spread the rest of the contents near her body to make it look as though she had been robbed. He then made telephone calls suggesting that she had gone missing. The prosecution at the trial conceded that, on those facts, it was open to the defence to raise the issue of duress. In other words, they were not prepared to take the point that the defence of duress is not available to a principal in the first degree to murder. Consequently, the interesting question raised by the decisions in DPP for Northern Ireland v. Lynch (1975) A C 653 ; 61 Cr. App. R. 6, and Abbott v. R. (1976) 3 All E R 140 ; 63 Cr. App. R. 241, was not argued before us. We do not have to decide it. We pause only to observe that the jury would no doubt have been puzzled to learn that whether the appellant was to be convicted of murder or acquitted altogether might depend on whether the plug came off the end of the percolator flex when he began to pull it. There are other possible aspects of the defence of duress which do not arise for decision in this case, namely: (1) Whether in murder, duress, if available, excuses a defendant from criminal liability altogether or only reduces his offence to manslaughter. (2) Whether in murder a fear of physical injury (rather than one of death) can ever amount to duress. (3) To what extent fear of death or injury to persons other than the defendant may be relied upon. (4) Whether a fear of false imprisonment may be relied upon. The direction which the learned judge gave to the jury required them to ask themselves two questions. First, a subjective question which the learned judge formulated thus: ""Was this man at the time of the killing taking part.....because he feared for his own life (or) personal safety as a result of the words or the conduct.....on the part of King, either personally experienced by him, or genuinely believed in by him....."". Neither side in the present appeal has taken issue with the learned judge on this question. We feel, however, that, for purposes of completeness, we should say that the direction appropriate in this particular case should have been in these words: ""Was this man at the time of the killing taking part because he held a well-grounded fear of death (or serious physical injury) as a result of the words or conduct on the part of King?"" The bracketed words may be too favourable to the defendant. The point was not argued before us. The learned judge then went on to direct the jury that if the answer to that first question was ""yes"", or ""he may have been"", the jury should then go on to consider a second question importing an objective test of reasonableness. This is the issue which arises in this appeal. Mr. Kennedy for the appellant contends that no second question arises at all; the test is purely subjective. He argues that if the appellant's will was in fact overborne by threats of the requisite cogency, he is entitled to be acquitted and no question arises as to whether a reasonable man, with or without his characteristics, would have reacted similarly. Mr. Sherrard, for the Crown, on the other hand, submits that such dicta as can be found on the point are in favour of a second test; this time an objective test. He argues that public policy requires this and draws an analogy with provocation. He submits that while the learned judge was right to pose a second question, he formulated it too favourably to the appellant. The question was put to the jury in the following terms: ""Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including the age, sex, sexual propensities and other characteristics personal to the defendant, including his state of mind and the amount of drink or drugs he had taken, was it reasonable for the defendant to behave in the way he did, that is to take part in the murder of his wife.... as a result of the fear..... present at the time in his mind.....The test of reasonableness in this context is: would the defendant's behaviour in all the particular circumstances to which I have just referred reflect the degree of self control and firmness of purpose(which) everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens would exercise in society as it is today. "" If the references to drink and drugs had been omitted, the judge's phraseology would have been in line with the direction given in cases of provocation. (See DPP v. Camplin (1978) A C 705 ; 67 Cr. App. R. 14 and Newell (1980) 71 Cr. App. R. 331). By using those words the learned judge introduced, says Mr. Sherrard, transitory factors and self induced factors peculiar to the appellant and having no place in an objective test. There is no direct binding authority on the questions whether the test is solely subjective or, if objective, how it is to be formulated. The point did not arise for decision in Lynch , but Lord Wilberforce (at 61 Cr. App. R. 21 and (1975) A. C. 683) cited, with apparent approval, ""as a statement of principle"" a passage from the judgment of Rumpff J. in Goliath (1972) (3) SA1, which included the following words: ""It seems to me to be irrational.....to exclude compulsion as a complete defence to murder if the threatened party was under such a strong duress that a reasonable person would not have acted otherwise under the same duress"". A little later Lord Wilberforce went on: ""The judges have always assumed responsibility for deciding questions of principle relating to criminal liability and guilt and particularly for setting the standards by which the law expects normal men to act. In all such matters as capacity, sanity, drunkenness, coercion, necessity, provocation, self-defence, the common law, through the judges, accepts and sets the standards of right thinking men of normal firmness and humanity at a level at which people can accept and respect. "" Lord Morris (at 61 Cr. App. R. 10 and (1975) A. C. 670) referred to, ""The standards of honest and reasonable men"" of which the law should take account. Lord Edmund Davies (at 61 Cr. App. R. 43 and (1975) A. C. 711) referred, with apparent approval, to a passage from the judgment of Murnaghan J. in Attorney General v. Whelan (1934) I. R. at page 526, as follows: ""Threats of immediate death or serious personal violence so great as to overbear the ordinary power of human resistance should be accepted as a justification for acts which would otherwise be criminal. "" Lord Simon mentioned ""subjectivity"", but only in relation to belief in the existence of the threat, not in regard to the defendant's conduct in reaction to the threat. In Archbold 40th Edition, paragraph 1449e, it is stated tentatively that the threats must be ""of such gravity that they might well have caused a reasonable man placed in the same position to act as he did. "" Smith and Hogan Criminal Law (4th Edition) state the law in this way (at page 205): ""Subjective or objective? Since duress is a concession to human frailty and some are more frail than others, so, it is arguable, the standard should vary. Probably, however, the standard of resolution and fortitude required is fixed by the law. It is for the law to lay down standards of conduct. Under provocation, D must display ""a reasonable degree of self restraint. When actually attacked, D may use only a reasonable degree of force in self-defence. In blackmail, P is expected to display a measure of fortitude and not to be affected by trivial threats. Probably, then, a person under duress must display reasonable fortitude and has no defence unless the threat is one which might have affected a reasonably resolute man. "" The Law Commission in their report on Defences of General Application (Law Com. No. 83) at paragraph 2. 28 make the following observations: ""It may be said that the whole test as to whether the requirements of duress exist should be subjective, but we feel that this would create too wide a defence. "" Serious personal injury can cover a wide range of threatened harm, and if the defence is to be available even in respect of the most serious offences, it would be unsatisfactory in the final event to dispense with some objective assessment of whether the defendant could reasonably have been expected to resist the threat. The solution which is adopted by section 2. 9 (1) of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code is to provide that the threat of unlawful force (which is left undefined) must be that 'which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist. ' Whether the words ""in his situation' comprehend more than the surrounding circumstances, and extend the characteristics of the defendant himself, it is difficult to say, and for that reason we would not recommend without qualification the adoption of that solution. We think that there should be an objective element in the requirements of the defence so that in the final event it will be for the jury to determine whether the threat was one which the defendant in question could not reasonably have been expected to resist. This will allow the jury to take into account the nature of the offence committed, its relationship to the threats which the defendant believed to exist, the threats themselves and the circumstances in which they were made, and the personal characteristics of the defendant. The last consideration is, we feel, a most important one. Threats directed against the weak, immature or disabled person, may well be much more compelling than the same threats directed against a normal healthy person. As a matter of public policy, it seems to us essential to limit the defence of duress by means of an objective criterion formulated in terms of reasonableness. Consistency of approach in defences to criminal liability is obviously desirable. Provocation and duress are analogous. In provocation the words or actions of one person break the self-control of another. In duress the words or actions of one person break the will of another. The law requires a defendant to have the self-control reasonably to be expected of the ordinary citizen in his situation. It should likewise require him to have the steadfastness reasonably to be expected of the ordinary citizen in his situation. So too with self-defence, in which the law permits the use of no more force than is reasonable in the circumstances. And, in general, if a mistake is to excuse what would otherwise be criminal, the mistake must be a reasonable one. It follows that we accept Mr. Sherrard's submission that the direction in this case was too favourable to the appellant. The Crown having conceded that the issue of duress was open to the appellant and was raised on the evidence, the correct approach on the facts of this case would have been as follows: (1) Was the defendant, or may he have been, impelled to act as he did because, as a result of what he reasonably believed King had said or done, he had good cause to fear that if he did not so act King would kill him or (if this is to be added) cause him serious physical injury? (2) If so, have the prosecution made the jury sure that a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the defendant, would not have responded to whatever he reasonably believed King said or did by taking part in the killing? The fact that a defendant's will to resist has been eroded by the voluntary consumption of drink or drugs or both is not relevant to this test. We doubt whether the Crown were right to concede that the question of duress ever arose on the facts of this case. The words and deeds of King relied on by the defence were far short of those needed to raise a threat of the requisite gravity. However, the Crown having made the concession, the learned judge was right to pose the second objective question to the jury. His only error lay in putting it too favourably to the appellant. The appeal is dismissed. MR. SHERRARD: Will your Lordships order that the respondent's costs be paid out of central funds? THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE: Yes.

CURTIS appeared on behalf of the Crown. ____________________ ____________________ ( As approved by Judge ) THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE : On 11th September 1980, at Maidstone Crown Court, the appellant was convicted of murder, before Purchas J. and a jury, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He now seeks to appeal against that conviction. The facts of the case were as follows. The appellant was the victim's husband. He is a practising homosexual. His wife was aware of this and indeed at the material time they were living in a bizarre menage a trois with another homosexual called King. There were living in the flat above two other homosexuals, named Gillis and Minter, with whom the appellant occasionally had sexual relations. The appellant and King were jointly charged with the murder. King pleaded guilty. The appellant admitted playing an active part in the events leading to the killing and admitted seeking to conceal the killing after it had happened. His defence was twofold. First, that he lacked the necessary intent, and he drew attention particularly to the drink and drugs he had taken; and, secondly, that whatever his intentional actions may have been, they were performed under duress because of his fear of King. We are satisfied that the directions given to the jury by the learned judge, on the issues of murder and manslaughter, on joint enterprise and on the relevance of drink and drugs to those issues, were impeccable. Other minor complaints made in the notice of appeal are also without foundation. The only live issue is, as Mr. Kennedy concedes, whether the direction to the jury on the question of duress was correct. The evidence relevant to this issue was this. The appellant had suffered for some time from an anxiety state. He was taking Valium tablets on prescription. There was medical evidence to the effect that valium, if taken in excess, would make him more susceptible to bullying, but that by mid-1980 he would have developed some tolerance to the drug. King was said to be a man of violence. There was evidence of altercations. In 1978 King had tipped the appellant and his wife off a settee because they were embracing and he was jealous. The appellant, it seems, knew of another incident in 1978 when some other woman had been assaulted by King and had had ribs broken. In June 1980, said the appellant, King had ""swiped him over the head"". On Friday, 27th June, 1980, the day before the killing, King attacked the wife with a knife. The appellant intervened and, for his trouble, cut his finger when he tried to grab the knife. As a result of this incident, the wife on the following day left and went to the appellant's mother's home. The appellant and King stayed behind and, together with the man Gillis, occupied their time in the flat drinking, talking and indulging in homosexual activities. The appellant said that he had a lot to drink during this time and had taken Valium tablets in excess of the quantity which had been prescribed for him. He also said that during the time that the three were together, he thought that King was going to attack him with a knife, but the incident came to nothing. Gillis left soon after midnight. King then suggested getting rid of the wife once and for all. The two of them hatched a plan. The appellant telephoned his wife in the small hours, told her falsely that he had cut his wrists and asked her to come home at once. Meanwhile, King bandaged both of the appellant' wrists and he, the appellant, lay face down on the floor pretending to be seriously hurt. When the wife arrived, she knelt down beside the appellant to see how he was. King had the flex from a coffee percolator in his hands. He attempted unsuccessfully to put it round the wife's neck while she was kneeling. The appellant and his wife then both got up and King said: ""What's it feel like to know that you are going to die, Betty?"" That remark was repeated. King then put the flex round the wife's neck and pulled it tight, hauling her off her feet onto his back as if she were a sack of coals. She put her hands up to the flex at her neck, whereupon King told the appellant to cut her fingers away.

As a result of the wounds inflicted, Mrs Maguire died in hospital shortly thereafter. On 3 November 2014 in the Crown Court at Leeds before Coulson J the applicant pleaded guilty to murder. The judge was by law required to pass a sentence of detention during Her Majesty's pleasure. He fixed the minimum term at 20 years (less time spent in custody on remand). The applicant's application for leave to appeal against sentence has been referred to the full court by the Registrar. It seems to us appropriate that we should grant leave. It is right that, in a case which has wholly exceptional features and relates to such a young offender, the full court should have the opportunity to review the entire matter. The Background The appellant was born on 26 June 1998. He entered Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in September 2009. By April 2014 he was in Year 11 and studying for his GCSE examinations. He had taken and passed several exams a year early. His school reports had generally been positive. It is important to point out that his parents were described as entirely responsible and caring. They had no explanation for what happened on 28 April 2014. The appellant's family life had been marked by love and support. His school records show that he had been happy and bright at nursery, had made good progress at primary school where the records described him as helpful, considerate and polite; he had a positive attitude to learning. In his first year at Corpus Christi, the school wrote to his parents congratulating him on his good effort and his academic progress. He was seen as reserved but amicable; he formed good friendships and benefited socially as well as academically from his studies at school. There were five recorded incidents of misbehaviour at school. The first two were minor. We shall turn to the other incidents in due course as they relate to events that occurred shortly before the murder. Much of the appellant's life seems to have changed at the age of 12 when he was diagnosed with diabetes whilst on holiday. This appears to have had a major impact on his lifestyle, his mood and his personality, although he continued to maintain his good academic performance and his keen intellectual ability. About one year after the diagnosis of diabetes, it became apparent to other pupils in the school that the appellant had developed a hatred of Spanish lessons and of Mrs Maguire as the Spanish teacher. He told more than one pupil that he hated her and wanted her dead. On Christmas Eve and during the early hours of Christmas Day 2013 the appellant exchanged messages with a friend on ""Facebook"". In those messages he spoke of brutally killing Mrs Maguire and spending the rest of his life in jail so as not to have to worry about life or money. He claimed to hear voices. That was something, which he was later to assert, as a result of which he would receive what he described as ""comfy wall"". That is an important element of the premeditated nature of what he did. He continued to make threats towards Mrs Maguire on Facebook in early January 2014. In February 2014 the appellant failed to do his Spanish homework. Mrs Maguire told him that in consequence he could not attend a school bowling trip. The appellant disobeyed her and went anyway. As a result, on 10 February 2014 the appellant was spoken to by another teacher. The appellant indicated his dislike of Spanish and of Mrs Maguire. Mrs Maguire joined the meeting and expressed concern about the appellant. He then stood up and left the meeting. On the following day there was a meeting at the school with the appellant's parents. The appellant made it clear that he hated Mrs Maguire. He was placed on internal exclusion at the school for a day. Later that month in further Facebook messages he made it clear that in his view Mrs Maguire deserved more than death, more than pain, and more than torture. The murder The murder of Mrs Maguire occurred on Monday 28 April 2014. On the weekend before nothing untoward occurred at home which alerted his family to what was about to happen. However, the appellant told Dr Kent, one of the psychiatrists who later examined him, that he had decided on Thursday 24 April to kill her and had rejected the alternative that he had been considering of killing himself. On Sunday 27 April (the day before the murder) he considered the weapons he should use and how he should kill her. He decided that he would use a knife and that he would kill her at school in circumstances where he would be caught and sent to jail. During the morning of 28 April 2014 the appellant told pupils that he was armed with knives. He showed them to some and said that he intended to attack Mrs Maguire. Some thought he was not serious. Those who thought he was serious received threats from him that he would kill them if they revealed his plan. He told another pupil that he had brought alcohol with him in order to celebrate after the killing. Shortly after the mid-morning break, at about 11.30am, the appellant attended Mrs Maguire's Spanish lesson. At an early stage in the lesson he went into an adjoining room to work on computers as part of the lesson. He showed the knife he had brought to one of the pupils. He then got up from that room and walked into the adjacent room where Mrs Maguire was leaning over, looking at the work of one of the other pupils. The appellant approached her from behind. He began to stab her in the neck and back. He was about a foot taller than her and of substantially greater build. The knife he used was a large kitchen knife. Mrs Maguire fled, but she was pursued by the appellant. He stabbed her as she sought to escape. Eventually, she was able to enter another room while another member of staff bravely prevented the appellant from continuing his attack. Paramedics were called to attend Mrs Maguire. She was taken to hospital. However, she died at 1.10pm. Following the stabbing, the appellant returned to his classroom. He sat down beside a pupil as if nothing had happened. He said that he had stabbed Mrs Maguire. He added that it was a pity that she was not dead. The evidence of fellow pupils was that he was pleased with what he had done. When two members of staff came in for him, he put up his hands and went with them peaceably. His bag was examined. It was found to contain a bottle of Jack Daniels bourbon and a second knife. Whilst waiting for the police to arrive, he chatted as if nothing had happened. The appellant gave no explanation to the police when he was interviewed, but he told Dr Kent that the killing had been on his mind since Year 8. He had always told his friends that Mrs Maguire was terrible. He explained that he had wanted to apply to join the army, but he was rejected because of his diabetes. He knew what he had done and he did not care. He had no remorse. He said, ""As generations of life, killing is a route of survival. It's kill or be killed. I did not have a choice. It was kill her or suicide"". He added later that he did not care that Mrs Maguire's family would be upset. In his eyes everything he had done was ""fine and dandy"". The pathologist's evidence showed the brutality of the attack. The appellant had stabbed Mrs Maguire seven times to the neck and upper back. One stab caused the knife to pass all the way through her lower neck. Another severed the jugular vein. Two other stabs shattered her ribs. They must, therefore, have been inflicted with severe force. One penetrated the right lung. The Psychiatric Evidence The sentencing judge had before him three reports provided by the prosecution: one from Dr Kent, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Stockton Hall Hospital, Yorkshire; one from Dr Cesar Lengua, a Consultant Psychiatrist in the field of Adolescent Forensic Psychiatry working for the Northern Forensic Mental Health Service for Young People, and a Clinical Lecturer at the University of Newcastle; and a clinical psychology report from Dr Tim Diggle, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist at the Northern Forensic Mental Health Service for Young People. Dr Kent's conclusion was that the applicant had an adjustment disorder which had affected the development of his personality. He believed that the appellant had a personality disorder with marked psychopathic traits. He considered that the appellant was a serious risk of grave homicidal violence to the public for the foreseeable future. He considered that the disorders from which the appellant suffered did not give rise in any way to a defence of diminished responsibility. Dr Lengua essentially agreed with Dr Kent's conclusions. He could not exclude the possibility that the appellant would kill again. He also was of the firm view that there was no defence of diminished responsibility. Dr Diggle concluded that the appellant had made Mrs Maguire a repository for his angry feelings which, because of his personality and his ability to cope, built up in severity. His angry feelings, combined with some of the cognitive symptoms associated with low mood, led to a narrowing of his thinking and deciding on a false choice between Mrs Maguire and himself. Again, there was nothing in his view that gave rise to a defence of diminished responsibility. It is clear on that evidence that the appellant was fit to plead and that there was no possible defence of diminished responsibility. The Appellant's Court Appearances The appellant appeared in court on 2 May 2014, a few days after the murder. Mr Wright QC, who has appeared on his behalf throughout, indicated at that hearing that it was unlikely there would be any dispute about the killing. At a further hearing on 11 July 2014 it was accepted that the killing had been carried out by the appellant and that it was unlawful. The only issue, therefore, was whether a defence of diminished responsibility would arise. It is important to make clear, as the prosecution accept, that Mr Wright QC and his team acted completely responsibly. At the first available opportunity the fact that the killing was accepted to be unlawful was acknowledged. That was an unequivocal statement, not a mere indication which would not have been enough. The second issue that arises is the position taken by the defence on the psychiatric evidence. They instructed Dr Vizard, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist and Expert in Child Psychiatry at University College London. She put forward the view that the appellant suffered from a delusional disorder, had acted in a blind rage at the time of the killing, and that therefore there might be a defence of diminished responsibility. It is clear on the facts, as has been accepted, that that view was wholly unsustainable. Again, we commend the responsible attitude of the defence in stating that that opinion was unsustainable. Accordingly, after receipt of that report and the Crown's psychiatric evidence a plea of guilty to murder was tendered. We shall return to those two matters when we give our decision. The Sentencing Hearing In addition to considering the evidence to which we have referred, the sentencing judge also considered the extremely moving personal statements from Mrs Maguire's husband, children, sisters and brothers-in-law. We, too, have read these. There can be no doubt about the devastation that her murder has caused to the family. Mrs Maguire's devoted service in schools endured over many years. Having reviewed all the evidence, including the psychiatric evidence, the judge concluded that there were seven significant aggravating factors: (1) there was extensive premeditation and planning; (2) the appellant had taken a knife to the classroom with the express purpose of killing; (3) Mrs Maguire had been subjected to considerable suffering before she died; (4) the killing occurred whilst Mrs Maguire was performing an important public duty as a teacher; (5) the killing was deliberately staged in front of a classroom of 15 and 16 year olds; it must have had a grave effect upon them; (6) the level of violence was savage and cowardly; the appellant approached his victim from behind; and (7) there was a total lack of remorse; there was none before the judge and there is none before us. The judge identified three mitigating factors: (1) the guilty plea, although the judge concluded that the maximum credit could not be given; (2) the appellant's adjustment disorder; and (3) his age. Under paragraph 7 of Schedule 21 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 the judge adopted the statutory minimum starting point of twelve years. He considered that the aggravating factors more than doubled that statutory starting point to a term of 25 years. From that he proceeded to deduct two years for the plea of guilty, and a further three years because of the appellant's youth and adjustment disorder. The judge gave no separate reduction for the previous good character as in his view that was a function of the appellant's youth. He therefore arrived at the minimum term of 20 years. The submissions on the appeal In the written submissions that have been put before us and in the eloquent submissions made today by Mr Wright QC, three points have been made. First, it is said that, looked at in the round, the aggravating factors did not justify an increase in the minimum term to 25 years. Second, it is said that the judge did not give sufficient credit for the guilty plea; that maximum credit should have been given. Thirdly, it is said that the judge should have taken into account the fact that the appellant had no previous convictions and should have given greater weight to his youth in arriving at the overall term. It is submitted that had those factors been taken into account, although a minimum term significantly in excess of twelve years would have been imposed, the judge would not have imposed a term of 20 years. We have been greatly assisted by Mr Greaney QC on behalf of the Crown, but we can state our conclusions shortly. Our conclusions As we have indicated, the judge was correct in his identification of each of the aggravating features. In our view the judge arrived at the correct figure of 25 years as a result of those aggravating features. We cannot see any basis on which he could in any way be criticised. He set the matters out with great clarity. The evidence on each of those matters was clear. We turn to the question of whether the judge was correct in his reduction of that provisional figure by five years, or whether he should have made a greater reduction. There were in our view four matters that the judge had to take into account: first, the appellant's youth; secondly, the fact that he had committed no previous offences. Regrettably, in our society there are many of the appellant's age who have already committed a number of serious offences. Although the appellant was not of entirely good character, we think that some recognition ought to have made for the fact that he had no previous convictions. Thirdly, there was the element (small as it is accepted to be) of the mental disorder. Finally, there was the question of whether proper credit had been given for the guilty plea. On that last point we are entirely satisfied that the course followed by Mr Wright QC in the indication of the guilty plea was in the circumstances entirely appropriate. It cannot be right, where an offender is aged only 15 or 16, to require him to admit only a few days later the killing and the fact that it was unlawful. In our view there can be no criticism of the fact that that was not formally done until 11 July 2014. We accept that, before the plea to murder was entered, a full examination of the psychiatric evidence had to be undertaken. However, we do not consider that the appellant was entitled to full credit for the guilty plea. It is plain from the facts and circumstances that we have set out in relation to the killing that the evidence was overwhelming. It seems to us that that follows also in respect of the psychiatric evidence. It cannot be said that if a psychiatrist produces a report that is obviously unsustainable, as Dr Vizard did, that that in any way gives rise to a doubt about the overwhelming nature of the case. We have looked at each of those four factors in the light of the detailed evidence which we have set out. We consider that, giving due weight to each of those factors, the deduction of five years that the judge made was correct. We then stood back and asked ourselves, taking into account the statutory factors, including the welfare of this young appellant: was this the right and proper sentence? In our view it was. On the disturbing facts of this case the minimum term of 20 years was entirely the right decision, essentially for the reasons given by the judge and those which we have set out in this judgment. Although we have granted leave to appeal so that this court has been able to give anxious consideration to all the factors in the case, we dismiss the appeal for the reasons we have given. The court would like to thank both counsel for their great assistance. Everyone has accepted that this matter should be dealt with in open court and that there are no reporting restrictions.  BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2015/110.html","Cornick, R. v [2015] EWCA Crim 110 (29 January 2015) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 110 Case No. 2014/05631/A6 B e f o r e : THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND AND WALES (Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd) THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL CRIMINAL DIVISION (Lady Justice Hallett DBE) And MR JUSTICE GLOBE ____________________ R E G I N A - v - WILLIAM ALEXANDER CORNICK ____________________ ) 165 Fleet Street, London EC4 Telephone No: 020 7404 1400; Fax No: 020 7404 1424 ( to the Court) ____________________ Mr Richard Wright QC appeared on behalf of the Applicant Mr Paul Greaney QC appeared on behalf of the Crown ____________________ (AS APPROVED BY THE COURT) ____________________ LORD THOMAS OF CWMGIEDD, CJ: Introduction On 28 April 2014 the applicant, then aged 15, stabbed Mrs Ann Maguire, a 61 year old Spanish teacher at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds.

We then stood back and asked ourselves, taking into account the statutory factors, including the welfare of this young appellant: was this the right and proper sentence? In our view it was. On the disturbing facts of this case the minimum term of 20 years was entirely the right decision, essentially for the reasons given by the judge and those which we have set out in this judgment. Although we have granted leave to appeal so that this court has been able to give anxious consideration to all the factors in the case, we dismiss the appeal for the reasons we have given. The court would like to thank both counsel for their great assistance. Everyone has accepted that this matter should be dealt with in open court and that there are no reporting restrictions. "

On 26 June 2020 in the Crown Court at Nottingham, the applicant Garry Cooper pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs. On 14 September 2020 in the same court he pleaded guilty to counts of affray and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear. 2. On 22 December 2020, following a trial before Goose J and a jury in the Crown Court at Nottingham, the applicant was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 29 years, less time spent on remand. Goose J sentenced him on the same occasion to concurrent determinate sentences of 13 years for the drugs conspiracy, 5 years for the firearms offence, 2 years for the affray and 8 months for breach of a suspended sentence order imposed on 30 August 2016 at Derby Crown Court for an offence of conspiracy to commit actual bodily harm. That suspended sentence was activated in full. 3. The firearms offence was committed by Cooper after he had been released under investigation for the murder of which he was subsequently convicted. On that occasion, the applicant was the front seat passenger in a car which was stopped by the police after a short chase, following reports that the three occupants had been seen earlier attacking another car with a sledgehammer and a baseball bat when both vehicles were waiting at traffic lights (the subject of the count of affray). A number of weapons were recovered, including a fully functional and loaded revolver which had been thrown from the car window and which had Cooper's DNA on it. This incident would ordinarily have attracted a consecutive sentence with a minimum term of five years. 4. Five of the co-accused on the murder count were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, each with a minimum term of 25 years less time spent on remand. Four of them had pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to supply class A drugs. A sixth co-accused, Connor Sharman, who also pleaded guilty to the drugs conspiracy, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment. 5. The applicant renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence following refusal by the single judge. 6. The applicant, who accepted he was known as ""Boss Man"" was involved with five of his co-defendants in a class A drug supply operation running two drug lines in Nottinghamshire, primarily servicing the areas of Sutton-in-Ashfield and Mansfield. They adopted a practice common to County Lines drugs operations of this kind known as ""cuckooing"", namely persuading a vulnerable individual to allow them to use his home as an address for customers to come to and buy the drugs. In this case, a 42-year-old vulnerable drug addict named Ross Ball agreed to the use of his flat at 14 Langton Court in return for drugs, food and other gifts. During the period of the conspiracy it was estimated that approximately 4.5 kilos of class A drugs had been supplied on the streets through the drug lines, quite apart from the drugs sold from the flat. 7. On 13 October 2019 a rival drugs group took over Mr Ball's flat and threatened those working for the applicant with violence. Two days later, on 1 November 2019, one of Cooper's associates and co-accused, Jake Honer (who was in a flat upstairs from 14 Langton Court) was assaulted, tortured and humiliated by members of that rival group who took away his mobile phone. Later that day, at around 21.17, CCTV footage captured the arrival in Langton Court of two cars, a Fiesta and an Audi, which were stolen vehicles with false number plates regularly used for the purposes of the drugs conspiracy. They waited outside for around an hour. At around 22.30 a number of men, including Honer, got out of the vehicles armed with at least three machetes, a sword and baseball bats, and went to the rear door of the flats, which someone had unlocked by pre-arrangement to give them access. Loud banging was heard by neighbours as they attempted to kick in the door to flat 14. 8. The occupants of the flat at that time were Mr Ball and two members of the rival drugs gang. All three escaped initially through the windows of the flat. The other two men ran away, leaving Mr Ball to face the attackers alone in the road outside. Shortly afterwards, Mr Ball was seen covered in blood, dragging himself along the road. He made a 999 call and paramedics arrived. Meanwhile his attackers drove off in the two vehicles. Mr Ball was still conscious and told the paramedics that he had been stabbed, but he did not know by whom. He lost a great deal of blood and went into cardiac arrest. Despite all efforts to save him, he died within the hour. 9. A post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had suffered a number of injuries, including four deep wounds to the back of his head, his left and right flank, and his right foot, and other superficial wounds. An expert pathologist gave evidence at trial that the death was caused by the loss of blood through the injury to his foot, although it may have been contributed to by a mixture of drugs in his body or a heart abnormality from which he suffered. 10. The prosecution case was that this was a revenge attack on the orders of Cooper who had sent his trusted right-hand men, his co-accused Matthew Jones and Shaun Buckley, along with others to travel to Langton Court armed with the bladed weapons and baseball bats and send out a message to the rival drugs gang. All six co-accused admitted travelling to the scene. It was admitted that Jones had travelled to the scene in the Audi with Honer and Connor Sharman (who was the driver), that Buckley had travelled in the Fiesta with two other co-accused, McDonald and Daw, and that some weapons were present. McDonald claimed that he was only there to protect Daw. Buckley admitted having a machete and knowing that others had weapons but claimed that he intended only to intimidate or frighten the occupants of the flat for the purposes of recovering money or drugs. Jones claimed that he knew of no plan for violence or a robbery and thought that Honer was collecting his belongings. Honer accepted that in a prepared statement he had given a false alibi to the police but he still denied taking part in any violence. Neither Jones nor Buckley accepted that the applicant knew of anything that had gone on. The applicant did not give evidence, having previously exercised his right to silence in police interview. 11. In the case of Cooper, the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, including evidence of his leading role in the drugs operation, together with his co-accused, and mobile phone evidence. That evidence demonstrated that the applicant had phone contact with both Jones and Buckley, who then contacted the other accused, during the period after the take-over of the flat by the rival gang and after the attack upon Honer. There was a similar pattern of telephone contact very shortly before and immediately after the attack on Mr Ball. The applicant spoke to Jones immediately prior to the attack. At 22.34 on the evening of the murder (just after the 999 call) there were two attempts by Jones and Buckley to contact the applicant by text and phone call. At 22.48 the applicant made a call to Buckley which lasted just over five minutes. At 22.59 Buckley sent a text to his girlfriend which read: ""On way back, babe. Won't be long. Ain't got cash on me. Went half out of hand. Boss man gonna pay us 5,000."" There had also been phone contact between the applicant and Honer, but there was no phone contact between the applicant and McDonald, a matter on which the defence relied as an indication that Cooper had not sent all the men to the address. The prosecution also relied on evidence of what happened after the attack. The Audi with Jones, Buckley, Honer and Sharman in it drove to meet up with the applicant in Mansfield. CCTV evidence showed that between 12.19 and 12.28 am the applicant and his partner, Miss Clay, appeared to be in conversation with Honer, Jones and Buckley. They then travelled back in a taxi to Sutton and to the scene of the murder, ostensibly en route to a public house. The applicant subsequently arranged and paid for Honer, Jones and Buckley to return to Birmingham in a taxi. Efforts were made to dispose of or to destroy evidence. Application for leave to appeal against conviction Trial counsel settled a sole ground on which the application for leave to appeal against conviction was made, although Miss Bennett-Jenkins QC, who appears on this renewed application and who did not appear at the trial below, has suggested that it has two elements. It is contended that in response to a jury question, the judge gave the jury only a partial reminder of the agreed written direction on circumstantial evidence and then added comments which were overtly favourable to the prosecution. In the written grounds it was said that this was despite a submission by Cooper's counsel that the jury should be told that, ""It was for the prosecution to disprove other alternative explanations and to apply the burden of proof rigorously to that approach"". There was no requirement on the judge to give the jury any such direction. Moreover, as the transcript clearly demonstrates, in fact he was not asked to. The written grounds of appeal must therefore have been settled on the basis of a mistaken recollection by trial counsel. As this court made clear in R v Kelly [2015] EWCA Crim 817 at paragraph 39, the risk of injustice that a circumstantial evidence direction is designed to confront is (1) that speculation might become a substitute for the drawing of a sure inference of guilt and (2) that the jury will neglect to take account of evidence that, if accepted, tends to diminish or even exclude the inference of guilt. However, as the court said in that case, there is no requirement to give the jury a special direction as to the burden and standard of proof or to use any particular form of words. In this case, we are satisfied that the directions given to the jury by the judge were more than adequate to protect against those risks. The agreed direction given to the jury on circumstantial evidence during the judge's summing-up was discussed with counsel in the normal way before the directions were provided to the jury both in writing and orally. That direction followed the guidance in the Crown Court Compendium. It occupied five paragraphs in Part 2 of the judge's written directions and, as, the single judge observed, it was impeccable. Paragraph 1 was purely introductory. The jury were told in paragraph 2 that: ""The evidence against Cooper is not from direct evidence, in the form of witnesses seeing him direct the attack, but is entirely based on what is sometimes referred to as circumstantial evidence: that is pieces of evidence relating to different circumstances, none of which on their own directly proves his guilt but which, say the prosecution, when taken together leaves no doubt that Cooper is guilty ."" (Emphasis as in the original). After then fairly identifying the evidence in question and summarising the competing contentions of the prosecution and defence relating to it in paragraphs 3 and 4 respectively, the direction concluded in paragraph 5: "" It is for you to decide what conclusions you can fairly and reasonably draw from any pieces of evidence that you do accept, taking these pieces of evidence together. "" It continues: ""You must not however engage in guess-work or speculation about matters which have not been proved by any evidence. Finally, you must weigh up all the evidence and decide whether the prosecution have made you sure that Cooper is guilty."" No issue has been taken or could be taken with the essential content of that direction, taken as a whole. When summing-up the defence case in respect of the applicant, the judge reminded the jury of the written direction that he had given as to the meaning of circumstantial evidence and of defence counsel's argument that the circumstantial evidence was not sufficient to make them sure of his guilt. (This is found in the transcript on 15 December 2020 at page 40B to G.) The transcript of the hearing on 22 December 2020, when the jury note was discussed with trial counsel, indicates the following. The question which the jury asked was: ""Can you give us any more direction on circumstantial evidence?"" The judge said to counsel that he was not minded to say any more than simply remind the jury of the written directions he had given them and maybe to add that: ""evidence in a criminal trial can be direct evidence or circumstantial evidence. It's all evidence that you must consider following the written direction I've given you, paragraphs 1 to 5."" The applicant's trial counsel said that he had no observations about that, but for the judge to remind the jury that it was for the prosecution to establish the case upon that evidence. However, just as the judge started to observe that he thought that that was clear from the written directions, the applicant's counsel cut across him and said: ""I think you said that -- in your main direction."" It would appear from the transcript that counsel did not have a copy of that direction before him at the time when he said that, but the judge gave him the opportunity to obtain one. The judge then said again that he proposed to refer the jury to paragraphs 1 to 5, and suggested that he might re-read them paragraph 2. The applicant's counsel, who by then had managed to obtain a copy of the written direction, specifically said that he ""would agree with that"" [course]. Despite that exchange, Miss Bennett-Jenkins has contended before us that the judge should have taken matters into his own hands and that he should have decided that the jury needed more help. They would not have asked the question, she submitted, if they had already been able to follow the directions that they were given. She suggested that the judge should have referred to the exact language of the suggested direction in the Crown Court Compendium which uses the phrase: ""all other possibilities consistent with innocence can be excluded"". As we have already said, it is clear from the case of Kelly that no particular form of language needs to be used, provided that the overall direction is fair and balanced. Miss Bennett-Jenkins also contended that in reminding the jury of paragraph 2 and in particular the closing part of it which refers to the prosecution saying that the evidence when taken together leaves no doubt that Cooper is guilty, the reference to the prosecution case was not counter-balanced by a fair reminder of what the defence had to say. But of course the jury were being taken back to paragraphs 1 to 5 in their entirety. The defence case in relation to the circumstantial evidence was set out in summary in paragraph 3, and so they were being invited specifically to turn their mind to what the defence had to say about that, as well as to what the prosecution had to say. In the light of the transcript, there is in our judgment no basis for making any complaint about what the judge did, which was exactly what he had indicated he would do, and to which Cooper's counsel at the time had rightly raised no objection. It is simply not right to characterise what the judge did as giving the jury only a partial reminder of the agreed written direction, and it is equally wrong to characterise what he did as giving them no assistance. They were plainly assisted by his direction and the reminder to go back to what he had said, because they returned verdicts not long after he had given them the assistance that they asked for. The judge said that the direction was set out in paragraphs 1 to 5 of his written directions and he was not going to add to it. He was entitled to do that. He invited the jury to consider those five paragraphs. He said: ""They're meant to give direction as to how you approach the evidence."" He then specifically re-read them paragraph 2 which contained the essential definition of circumstantial evidence and addressed the two mischiefs referred to in Kelly . That was not an error, nor was it unfair or favourable to the prosecution, and defence counsel had agreed to that course. All that the judge added, as he had foreshadowed in his discussions with counsel, was that in a criminal trial evidence can be direct or circumstantial. He said: ""It's all evidence and it's evidence that you must consider and follow the written direction that I have given to you. I can't, I'm afraid, go further than that."" No complaint can be made about those remarks, which certainly did not favour the prosecution. There is always a danger when a jury note is sent in in a case of this kind of further directions confusing a jury or even contradicting what was said at an earlier stage. We are sure that if defence counsel had thought that it was appropriate at the time to ask the judge to give a further direction, he would have asked for further time in which to formulate the words and the judge would have given him that time, but it was not done and one can understand why. In the light of this, there is no merit whatsoever in the submission in paragraph 14 of the original advice on appeal that the judge's response to the jury's question ""must have had an undue and potentially unfair influence on them"". The jury were properly directed. The evidence against the applicant may well have been circumstantial but it was more than adequate to support a conviction. As the single judge said, this ground is unarguable and the conviction is safe. This renewed application is refused. Application for leave to appeal against sentence The judge sentenced Cooper and the other defendants who were convicted of murder on the basis that they did not intend to kill but to cause really serious harm, but that each of them knew that weapons, in particular bladed ones, were being taken to the scene for the purpose of causing such harm. He was satisfied that the applicant directed the attack with the intention of sending out a clear message to the rival drugs operation. The applicant was, at 34 years old, the oldest and had already amassed 20 convictions for 43 offences, including the offences of affray and possession of the firearm with intent to cause fear for which he also fell to be sentenced on that occasion. The judge took a starting point of 25 years for the minimum term of the life sentence because of the taking of weapons to the scene. He correctly identified the aggravating factors as significant planning, the fact that there were six attackers acting together, the disposal or attempted disposal of evidence, and the background of drug dealing. He sentenced the applicant as the ringleader and explained that he had increased the minimum term in his case from 27 years to 29 years to reflect the firearms offence, committed separately, for which he also had to sentence him. When sentencing for the firearms offence, he explained that although normally that sentence would be required to be served consecutively, given the life sentence that he had imposed for the murder, he had taken this offence into account in fixing Cooper's minimum term of 29 years, and that the five-year minimum sentence imposed for the firearms offence would be served concurrently. In the initial grounds of appeal it was contended that the judge had imposed too high a sentence in respect of the conspiracy to supply class A drugs, although that was a concurrent sentence. Very sensibly, on instructions, Miss Bennett-Jenkins does not pursue that ground before us on this renewed application. As for the firearms offence, the submission is essentially one based on totality. Although Miss Bennett-Jenkins rightly accepted that it was open to the judge to have passed a consecutive sentence for the firearms offence which would have carried with it a minimum term of five years, she submitted that the overall criminality of his offending was adequately reflected in the uplift from 25 to 27 years and that the 29-year period that was imposed in relation to the firearms offence was excessive. That is a slightly different way of putting the ground of appeal from the way in which it was put in the written grounds, which complained of an element of double-counting. In our judgment, however it is put, there is nothing in this ground either. The firearms offence was a serious offence which was committed after the murder and in the company of two men other than the co-accused in the murder and drugs conspiracy counts. The firearm was loaded with two live bulleted cartridges and the applicant's DNA was found on the grip and the muzzle. Had the judge been sentencing for any other offence than murder he would have been likely to pass a consecutive sentence, but after considering totality and proportionality he decided to reflect this additional and unrelated serious criminality by taking the course that he did. There was nothing arguably wrong with that approach, and it certainly did not involve any element of double-counting. The judge reflected the overall criminality of Cooper's conduct by making an uplift of two years to the minimum term, which is less than half a five-year determinate sentence. It might be possible to infer from the mathematics that he had it in mind to give some credit for the guilty plea to the firearms offence. In any event, in adding the extra two years on he certainly did not double-count, and he did not go beyond that which was appropriate, having in mind the overall principle of totality. Therefore, this renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence is also refused.

On 26 June 2020 in the Crown Court at Nottingham, the applicant Garry Cooper pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs. On 14 September 2020 in the same court he pleaded guilty to counts of affray and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear. 2. On 22 December 2020, following a trial before Goose J and a jury in the Crown Court at Nottingham, the applicant was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 29 years, less time spent on remand. Goose J sentenced him on the same occasion to concurrent determinate sentences of 13 years for the drugs conspiracy, 5 years for the firearms offence, 2 years for the affray and 8 months for breach of a suspended sentence order imposed on 30 August 2016 at Derby Crown Court for an offence of conspiracy to commit actual bodily harm. That suspended sentence was activated in full. 3. The firearms offence was committed by Cooper after he had been released under investigation for the murder of which he was subsequently convicted. On that occasion, the applicant was the front seat passenger in a car which was stopped by the police after a short chase, following reports that the three occupants had been seen earlier attacking another car with a sledgehammer and a baseball bat when both vehicles were waiting at traffic lights (the subject of the count of affray). A number of weapons were recovered, including a fully functional and loaded revolver which had been thrown from the car window and which had Cooper's DNA on it. This incident would ordinarily have attracted a consecutive sentence with a minimum term of five years. 4. Five of the co-accused on the murder count were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, each with a minimum term of 25 years less time spent on remand. Four of them had pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to supply class A drugs. A sixth co-accused, Connor Sharman, who also pleaded guilty to the drugs conspiracy, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment. 5. The applicant renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence following refusal by the single judge. 6. The applicant, who accepted he was known as ""Boss Man"" was involved with five of his co-defendants in a class A drug supply operation running two drug lines in Nottinghamshire, primarily servicing the areas of Sutton-in-Ashfield and Mansfield. They adopted a practice common to County Lines drugs operations of this kind known as ""cuckooing"", namely persuading a vulnerable individual to allow them to use his home as an address for customers to come to and buy the drugs. In this case, a 42-year-old vulnerable drug addict named Ross Ball agreed to the use of his flat at 14 Langton Court in return for drugs, food and other gifts. During the period of the conspiracy it was estimated that approximately 4.5 kilos of class A drugs had been supplied on the streets through the drug lines, quite apart from the drugs sold from the flat. 7. On 13 October 2019 a rival drugs group took over Mr Ball's flat and threatened those working for the applicant with violence. Two days later, on 1 November 2019, one of Cooper's associates and co-accused, Jake Honer (who was in a flat upstairs from 14 Langton Court) was assaulted, tortured and humiliated by members of that rival group who took away his mobile phone. Later that day, at around 21.17, CCTV footage captured the arrival in Langton Court of two cars, a Fiesta and an Audi, which were stolen vehicles with false number plates regularly used for the purposes of the drugs conspiracy. They waited outside for around an hour. At around 22.30 a number of men, including Honer, got out of the vehicles armed with at least three machetes, a sword and baseball bats, and went to the rear door of the flats, which someone had unlocked by pre-arrangement to give them access. Loud banging was heard by neighbours as they attempted to kick in the door to flat 14. 8. The occupants of the flat at that time were Mr Ball and two members of the rival drugs gang. All three escaped initially through the windows of the flat. The other two men ran away, leaving Mr Ball to face the attackers alone in the road outside. Shortly afterwards, Mr Ball was seen covered in blood, dragging himself along the road. He made a 999 call and paramedics arrived. Meanwhile his attackers drove off in the two vehicles. Mr Ball was still conscious and told the paramedics that he had been stabbed, but he did not know by whom. He lost a great deal of blood and went into cardiac arrest. Despite all efforts to save him, he died within the hour. 9. A post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had suffered a number of injuries, including four deep wounds to the back of his head, his left and right flank, and his right foot, and other superficial wounds. An expert pathologist gave evidence at trial that the death was caused by the loss of blood through the injury to his foot, although it may have been contributed to by a mixture of drugs in his body or a heart abnormality from which he suffered. 10. The prosecution case was that this was a revenge attack on the orders of Cooper who had sent his trusted right-hand men, his co-accused Matthew Jones and Shaun Buckley, along with others to travel to Langton Court armed with the bladed weapons and baseball bats and send out a message to the rival drugs gang. All six co-accused admitted travelling to the scene. It was admitted that Jones had travelled to the scene in the Audi with Honer and Connor Sharman (who was the driver), that Buckley had travelled in the Fiesta with two other co-accused, McDonald and Daw, and that some weapons were present. McDonald claimed that he was only there to protect Daw. Buckley admitted having a machete and knowing that others had weapons but claimed that he intended only to intimidate or frighten the occupants of the flat for the purposes of recovering money or drugs. Jones claimed that he knew of no plan for violence or a robbery and thought that Honer was collecting his belongings. Honer accepted that in a prepared statement he had given a false alibi to the police but he still denied taking part in any violence. Neither Jones nor Buckley accepted that the applicant knew of anything that had gone on. The applicant did not give evidence, having previously exercised his right to silence in police interview. 11. In the case of Cooper, the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, including evidence of his leading role in the drugs operation, together with his co-accused, and mobile phone evidence. That evidence demonstrated that the applicant had phone contact with both Jones and Buckley, who then contacted the other accused, during the period after the take-over of the flat by the rival gang and after the attack upon Honer. There was a similar pattern of telephone contact very shortly before and immediately after the attack on Mr Ball. The applicant spoke to Jones immediately prior to the attack. At 22.34 on the evening of the murder (just after the 999 call) there were two attempts by Jones and Buckley to contact the applicant by text and phone call. At 22.48 the applicant made a call to Buckley which lasted just over five minutes. At 22.59 Buckley sent a text to his girlfriend which read: ""On way back, babe. Won't be long. Ain't got cash on me. Went half out of hand. Boss man gonna pay us 5,000."" There had also been phone contact between the applicant and Honer, but there was no phone contact between the applicant and McDonald, a matter on which the defence relied as an indication that Cooper had not sent all the men to the address. The prosecution also relied on evidence of what happened after the attack. The Audi with Jones, Buckley, Honer and Sharman in it drove to meet up with the applicant in Mansfield. CCTV evidence showed that between 12.19 and 12.28 am the applicant and his partner, Miss Clay, appeared to be in conversation with Honer, Jones and Buckley. They then travelled back in a taxi to Sutton and to the scene of the murder, ostensibly en route to a public house. The applicant subsequently arranged and paid for Honer, Jones and Buckley to return to Birmingham in a taxi. Efforts were made to dispose of or to destroy evidence. Application for leave to appeal against conviction Trial counsel settled a sole ground on which the application for leave to appeal against conviction was made, although Miss Bennett-Jenkins QC, who appears on this renewed application and who did not appear at the trial below, has suggested that it has two elements. It is contended that in response to a jury question, the judge gave the jury only a partial reminder of the agreed written direction on circumstantial evidence and then added comments which were overtly favourable to the prosecution. In the written grounds it was said that this was despite a submission by Cooper's counsel that the jury should be told that, ""It was for the prosecution to disprove other alternative explanations and to apply the burden of proof rigorously to that approach"". There was no requirement on the judge to give the jury any such direction. Moreover, as the transcript clearly demonstrates, in fact he was not asked to. The written grounds of appeal must therefore have been settled on the basis of a mistaken recollection by trial counsel. As this court made clear in R v Kelly [2015] EWCA Crim 817 at paragraph 39, the risk of injustice that a circumstantial evidence direction is designed to confront is (1) that speculation might become a substitute for the drawing of a sure inference of guilt and (2) that the jury will neglect to take account of evidence that, if accepted, tends to diminish or even exclude the inference of guilt. However, as the court said in that case, there is no requirement to give the jury a special direction as to the burden and standard of proof or to use any particular form of words. In this case, we are satisfied that the directions given to the jury by the judge were more than adequate to protect against those risks. The agreed direction given to the jury on circumstantial evidence during the judge's summing-up was discussed with counsel in the normal way before the directions were provided to the jury both in writing and orally. That direction followed the guidance in the Crown Court Compendium. It occupied five paragraphs in Part 2 of the judge's written directions and, as, the single judge observed, it was impeccable. Paragraph 1 was purely introductory. The jury were told in paragraph 2 that: ""The evidence against Cooper is not from direct evidence, in the form of witnesses seeing him direct the attack, but is entirely based on what is sometimes referred to as circumstantial evidence: that is pieces of evidence relating to different circumstances, none of which on their own directly proves his guilt but which, say the prosecution, when taken together leaves no doubt that Cooper is guilty ."" (Emphasis as in the original). After then fairly identifying the evidence in question and summarising the competing contentions of the prosecution and defence relating to it in paragraphs 3 and 4 respectively, the direction concluded in paragraph 5: "" It is for you to decide what conclusions you can fairly and reasonably draw from any pieces of evidence that you do accept, taking these pieces of evidence together. "" It continues: ""You must not however engage in guess-work or speculation about matters which have not been proved by any evidence. Finally, you must weigh up all the evidence and decide whether the prosecution have made you sure that Cooper is guilty."" No issue has been taken or could be taken with the essential content of that direction, taken as a whole. When summing-up the defence case in respect of the applicant, the judge reminded the jury of the written direction that he had given as to the meaning of circumstantial evidence and of defence counsel's argument that the circumstantial evidence was not sufficient to make them sure of his guilt. (This is found in the transcript on 15 December 2020 at page 40B to G.) The transcript of the hearing on 22 December 2020, when the jury note was discussed with trial counsel, indicates the following. The question which the jury asked was: ""Can you give us any more direction on circumstantial evidence?"" The judge said to counsel that he was not minded to say any more than simply remind the jury of the written directions he had given them and maybe to add that: ""evidence in a criminal trial can be direct evidence or circumstantial evidence. It's all evidence that you must consider following the written direction I've given you, paragraphs 1 to 5."" The applicant's trial counsel said that he had no observations about that, but for the judge to remind the jury that it was for the prosecution to establish the case upon that evidence. However, just as the judge started to observe that he thought that that was clear from the written directions, the applicant's counsel cut across him and said: ""I think you said that -- in your main direction."" It would appear from the transcript that counsel did not have a copy of that direction before him at the time when he said that, but the judge gave him the opportunity to obtain one. The judge then said again that he proposed to refer the jury to paragraphs 1 to 5, and suggested that he might re-read them paragraph 2. The applicant's counsel, who by then had managed to obtain a copy of the written direction, specifically said that he ""would agree with that"" . Despite that exchange, Miss Bennett-Jenkins has contended before us that the judge should have taken matters into his own hands and that he should have decided that the jury needed more help. They would not have asked the question, she submitted, if they had already been able to follow the directions that they were given. She suggested that the judge should have referred to the exact language of the suggested direction in the Crown Court Compendium which uses the phrase: ""all other possibilities consistent with innocence can be excluded"". As we have already said, it is clear from the case of Kelly that no particular form of language needs to be used, provided that the overall direction is fair and balanced. Miss Bennett-Jenkins also contended that in reminding the jury of paragraph 2 and in particular the closing part of it which refers to the prosecution saying that the evidence when taken together leaves no doubt that Cooper is guilty, the reference to the prosecution case was not counter-balanced by a fair reminder of what the defence had to say. But of course the jury were being taken back to paragraphs 1 to 5 in their entirety. The defence case in relation to the circumstantial evidence was set out in summary in paragraph 3, and so they were being invited specifically to turn their mind to what the defence had to say about that, as well as to what the prosecution had to say. In the light of the transcript, there is in our judgment no basis for making any complaint about what the judge did, which was exactly what he had indicated he would do, and to which Cooper's counsel at the time had rightly raised no objection. It is simply not right to characterise what the judge did as giving the jury only a partial reminder of the agreed written direction, and it is equally wrong to characterise what he did as giving them no assistance. They were plainly assisted by his direction and the reminder to go back to what he had said, because they returned verdicts not long after he had given them the assistance that they asked for. The judge said that the direction was set out in paragraphs 1 to 5 of his written directions and he was not going to add to it. He was entitled to do that. He invited the jury to consider those five paragraphs. He said: ""They're meant to give direction as to how you approach the evidence."" He then specifically re-read them paragraph 2 which contained the essential definition of circumstantial evidence and addressed the two mischiefs referred to in Kelly . That was not an error, nor was it unfair or favourable to the prosecution, and defence counsel had agreed to that course. All that the judge added, as he had foreshadowed in his discussions with counsel, was that in a criminal trial evidence can be direct or circumstantial. He said: ""It's all evidence and it's evidence that you must consider and follow the written direction that I have given to you. I can't, I'm afraid, go further than that."" No complaint can be made about those remarks, which certainly did not favour the prosecution. There is always a danger when a jury note is sent in in a case of this kind of further directions confusing a jury or even contradicting what was said at an earlier stage. We are sure that if defence counsel had thought that it was appropriate at the time to ask the judge to give a further direction, he would have asked for further time in which to formulate the words and the judge would have given him that time, but it was not done and one can understand why. In the light of this, there is no merit whatsoever in the submission in paragraph 14 of the original advice on appeal that the judge's response to the jury's question ""must have had an undue and potentially unfair influence on them"". The jury were properly directed. The evidence against the applicant may well have been circumstantial but it was more than adequate to support a conviction. As the single judge said, this ground is unarguable and the conviction is safe. This renewed application is refused. Application for leave to appeal against sentence The judge sentenced Cooper and the other defendants who were convicted of murder on the basis that they did not intend to kill but to cause really serious harm, but that each of them knew that weapons, in particular bladed ones, were being taken to the scene for the purpose of causing such harm. He was satisfied that the applicant directed the attack with the intention of sending out a clear message to the rival drugs operation. The applicant was, at 34 years old, the oldest and had already amassed 20 convictions for 43 offences, including the offences of affray and possession of the firearm with intent to cause fear for which he also fell to be sentenced on that occasion. The judge took a starting point of 25 years for the minimum term of the life sentence because of the taking of weapons to the scene. He correctly identified the aggravating factors as significant planning, the fact that there were six attackers acting together, the disposal or attempted disposal of evidence, and the background of drug dealing. He sentenced the applicant as the ringleader and explained that he had increased the minimum term in his case from 27 years to 29 years to reflect the firearms offence, committed separately, for which he also had to sentence him. When sentencing for the firearms offence, he explained that although normally that sentence would be required to be served consecutively, given the life sentence that he had imposed for the murder, he had taken this offence into account in fixing Cooper's minimum term of 29 years, and that the five-year minimum sentence imposed for the firearms offence would be served concurrently. In the initial grounds of appeal it was contended that the judge had imposed too high a sentence in respect of the conspiracy to supply class A drugs, although that was a concurrent sentence. Very sensibly, on instructions, Miss Bennett-Jenkins does not pursue that ground before us on this renewed application. As for the firearms offence, the submission is essentially one based on totality. Although Miss Bennett-Jenkins rightly accepted that it was open to the judge to have passed a consecutive sentence for the firearms offence which would have carried with it a minimum term of five years, she submitted that the overall criminality of his offending was adequately reflected in the uplift from 25 to 27 years and that the 29-year period that was imposed in relation to the firearms offence was excessive. That is a slightly different way of putting the ground of appeal from the way in which it was put in the written grounds, which complained of an element of double-counting. In our judgment, however it is put, there is nothing in this ground either. The firearms offence was a serious offence which was committed after the murder and in the company of two men other than the co-accused in the murder and drugs conspiracy counts. The firearm was loaded with two live bulleted cartridges and the applicant's DNA was found on the grip and the muzzle. Had the judge been sentencing for any other offence than murder he would have been likely to pass a consecutive sentence, but after considering totality and proportionality he decided to reflect this additional and unrelated serious criminality by taking the course that he did. There was nothing arguably wrong with that approach, and it certainly did not involve any element of double-counting. The judge reflected the overall criminality of Cooper's conduct by making an uplift of two years to the minimum term, which is less than half a five-year determinate sentence. It might be possible to infer from the mathematics that he had it in mind to give some credit for the guilty plea to the firearms offence. In any event, in adding the extra two years on he certainly did not double-count, and he did not go beyond that which was appropriate, having in mind the overall principle of totality. Therefore, this renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence is also refused."

LORD JUSTICE WILLIAM DAVIS : On 10 June 2024 at the conclusion of a trial before Mrs Justice Tipples and a jury two 12 year olds to whom we shall refer as BGI and CMB were convicted of murder. CMB also was convicted of having a bladed article. BGI had pleaded guilty to that offence at an earlier stage of the proceedings. On 27 September 2024 in the Crown Court at Wolverhampton sitting in Nottingham BGI (""the first offender"") and CMB (""the second offender"") were detained during His Majesty's pleasure in relation to the offence of murder. The judge ordered a minimum term of 8 years 6 months less 315 days spent on remand. No separate penalty was imposed in relation to having a bladed article. HM Solicitor General has applied to this court for leave to refer the sentences as unduly lenient pursuant to section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The application is in respect of the minimum term in the case of each offender. Factual background The first offender was born on 1 September 2011. The second offender was born on 29 July 2011. They are friends. They went to the same school. Shortly after 8.15 p.m. on 13 November 2023 they were together in a park in the Wolverhampton area. One of them had a large machete with a blade approximately 15 inches long. Acting together they killed a 19 year old male who was on a bench with a friend. Their victim was stabbed in the back with the machete. The wound penetrated deep into the victim's body. He also sustained a serious wound to the head. At their trial each offender blamed the other for inflicting the fatal wound. The independent evidence did not point to one offender rather than the other being responsible. The jury convicted both offenders. They were satisfied that the offenders were acting jointly. The victim was Shawn Seesahai. His home was in Anguilla. His family still live there. He was in this country partly for education and partly to have treatment for his eyesight. On 13 November 2023 he was visiting Wolverhampton with a friend. In the early evening they were sitting on a bench in the park to which we have referred. There came a point at which they left the bench and went for a short walk. As they set off they passed the offenders. Shawn Seesahai did not know the offenders. They did not know him. After a few minutes Shawn and his friend came back to the bench. By now the offenders were on the bench. Shawn and his friend asked them to move. Without any warning Shawn was attacked with the machete. He was dead within a very short time of the attack. The offenders left the park. The offenders had gone to the park together at some point after the end of the school day. Before meeting the second offender, the first offender had retrieved the machete which was used to kill Shawn from under his bed at home. He had bought it the previous month from a friend for £40. It was kept under his bed so that his grandmother with whom he lived would not find it. He left his home with the machete hidden under the tracksuit he was wearing. After the weapon had been used to kill Shawn, the first offender took the machete away. It had blood on it. He went home and used bleach to clean the blade. The machete was found under his bed by the police. The offenders were arrested within a day or two of the murder. They were interviewed by the police. They answered no comment to all questions. The criminal proceedings The offenders appeared at the Youth Court on 17 November 2023. They were sent for trial at the Crown Court. They were arraigned on 8 April 2024. It was on that date that the first offender pleaded guilty to having a bladed article. The trial concluded on 10 June 2024. At the sentencing hearing the judge had a victim personal statement from Shawn's mother. She described her son's murder as tragic and senseless. She was utterly heart-broken. Her family had been devastated by his death. Whenever she closed her eyes all she imagined was her son's last moments and how scared he must have been. She described her son as humble, helpful and hardworking. He was a confident young man with a promising future. She struggled to come to terms with the fact that she would never see him again. In relation to the first offender there was a pre-sentence report and a clinical psychologist's report. The pre-sentence report said that the first offender had been diagnosed with ADHD in 2022. The assessment of the authors of the report was that he ""seems to function at a lower level than his chronological age both in terms of understanding and emotional literacy"". They reported that Children's Services had been involved with him and his family since he was very young. From his early years he had experienced violence within the family home. Those concerned with the first offender's welfare had been and remained concerned about the impact of his fractured childhood. They considered that developmental trauma was very likely to have affected adversely his cognitive development and his ability to regulate his emotions and to take informed decisions. The report described the first offender as having extremely complex needs. He had self-harmed in the past. The clinical psychologist concluded that the first offender was particularly vulnerable and immature. She assessed his verbal reasoning skills as being on a par with a typical 10 year old. There was evidence from the National Counter Trafficking Centre that the first offender was the victim of forced criminality. There was a conclusive grounds decision from the competent authority to that effect. The authors of the pre-sentence report confirmed this from their own knowledge. There was pre-sentence report in relation to the second offender. This indicated that he had had an unsettled childhood in that he had moved to the UK from the West Indies when he was very young and that his family had moved around within the UK once they had arrived. He had changed schools regularly. His parents had separated at one point. He had spent some time in a refuge. By the date of the sentencing hearing his family were more settled and he had their support. The authors of the report had met him three times before preparing it. They assessed his maturity in this way: ""Whilst he presents a resilient exterior and can display a maturity and sensitivity beyond his years as a 12-year-old he is unlikely to have the emotional capacity to process everything that has happened."" The report noted that the second offender was making very good progress in the secure accommodation in which he had been held since his arrest. In sentencing the offenders the judge said that she had to set the minimum term in relation to each offender by looking at them on an individual basis. She referred to the factors to be considered by reference to the Sentencing Council guideline Sentencing Children and Young People (""the Children guideline""). In terms of factors common to both offenders the judge found that the attack was carried out jointly by them. The fact that there were two individuals acting together aggravated the offence. A mitigating factor was the lack of premeditation. Dealing with the first offender the judge noted the conclusions of the reports as we have outlined above. By reference to those matters she determined that his emotional maturity and developmental age were less than his chronological age. He had suffered multiple traumas throughout his life. His culpability was reduced by these factors. Taking into account all that she knew about him, the judge found that the appropriate minimum term before any deduction of days on remand should be 8 years 6 months. In relation to the second offender the judge noted the various upheavals to his family which had disrupted his childhood. Although he was doing well in his secure accommodation, it would take time for him to mature emotionally and developmentally. The judge acknowledged that there was no evidence that his emotional maturity was not lower than his chronological age. Taking everything she knew about the second offender into account, the judge fixed the minimum term at 8 years 6 months. The submissions of the parties The Solicitor General was represented by Paul Jarvis. His core submission was, at the outset of determining the appropriate minimum term in a case of murder, the sentencing court must identify the appropriate starting point only by reference to the relevant part of Schedule 21 of the Sentencing Code. In the case of offenders under the age of 18, the starting points are in the table set out at paragraph 5A of the Schedule. Where an offender is 14 or under and the offence would fall within paragraph 4(1) of the Schedule if the offender had been an adult, the starting point is 13 years. Mr Jarvis submitted that, once the starting point is identified, there is no scope to modify it by reference to the offender's age, maturity or role in the offence. He said that the judge adopted this approach when she said (at 3H of the transcript) ""this case falls within paragraphs 5A and (iv) of the Code which means that as the defendants were 14 or under at the date of the offence the starting point is thirteen years. The starting point reflects the seriousness of the offence."" Mr Jarvis went on to argue that the judge's assessment of aggravating factors failed to include the fact that the murder had occurred in the presence of others. Shawn was killed in full view of his friend and of others in the park at the time. The judge also did not refer to the action of the first offender in taking the machete home where he cleaned it with bleach. That was an attempt to cover up what had happened. Further, the judge had referred to the lack of premeditation as a mitigating factor. Mr Jarvis submitted that this was of limited value. The offenders had gone to the park when they had a machete with them. They had created the circumstances in which the fatal attack was possible. In relation to the first offender Mr Jarvis argued that there should have been an uplift from the starting point of 13 years to take account of the aggravating factors before any reduction for mitigation. He said that the fact that someone was young and immature did not necessarily diminish that person's culpability for what they had done. In this case the judge was satisfied that there was an intention to kill Shawn. That meant that the first offender had a clear awareness of the consequences of his actions. Moreover, the judge mitigated the sentence to allow for the lack of premeditation. This accounted for the first offender's lack of ability to regulate his emotions. To use that factor to reduce culpability involved double counting. Taking all those matters into account, a downward adjustment of 4 ½ years was excessive. The resulting minimum term was unduly lenient. It was not a sentence reasonably open to the judge: Attorney General's Reference No 4 of 1989 [1990] 1 WLR 41. In respect of the second offender, Mr Jarvis submitted that his position was very different to that of the first offender. He was not immature for his age. He did not suffer from complex needs and developmental trauma. Whatever the position of the first offender, the minimum term in the second offender's case should have been greater. An individualistic approach to the sentencing of children may lead to different sentences for offenders jointly responsible for an offence. That ought to be the situation here. Even if the minimum term in the first offender's case was not unduly lenient, it was clearly unduly lenient for the second offender to be made subject to the same minimum term. On behalf of the first offender, Rachel Brand KC (who appeared at the trial) argued that the minimum term was fixed by the trial judge. She had heard all of the evidence. In her sentencing remarks she set out the relevant matters. It was not suggested that she had engaged in an impermissible approach at any point. Ms Brand stressed the immaturity of the first offender and the developmental issues affecting him. The judge was entitled to make a substantial downward adjustment from the starting point in paragraph 5A. She had a duty to impose the shortest possible minimum term. She did not fail in that duty. In her written submissions Ms Brand invited us to consider the eventual outcome in terms of sentence in relation to the two boys convicted of the murder of Jamie Bulger, namely a minimum term of 8 years. The second offender was and is presented by Paul Lewis KC. He adopted Ms Brand's submission about the overall approach of the trial judge. He met the suggestion that a distinction could be drawn between the respondents to the disadvantage of the second respondent by pointing out that the first respondent was responsible for purchasing the knife which he had chosen to bring to the scene. He also was the person who had taken away the knife and cleaned it with a view to destroying evidence. Thus, there was no proper basis for distinguishing between the two offenders vis-à-vis the minimum term to be applied. The legal framework It is important to remember how the starting points in Schedule 21 are to be applied. When the statutory starting points were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, it was a complete departure from the sentencing practice in relation to murder which had obtained hitherto. At an early stage this court explained how the starting points were to be used. In Jones [2005] EWCA Crim 3115 the then Lord Chief Justice said this: ""The guidance given by Schedule 21 is provided to assist the judge to determine the appropriate sentence. The judge must have regard to the guidance, but each case will depend critically on its particular facts. If the judge concludes that it is appropriate to follow a course that does not appear to reflect the guidance, the judge should explain the reason for this .. The starting points give the judge guidance as to the range within which the appropriate sentence is likely to fall having regard to the more salient features of the offence, but even then, as paragraph 9 [as it then was  now paragraph 8] recognises, ""detailed consideration of aggravating or mitigating factors may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), [emphasis ours] or in the making of a whole life order"". The starting points must not be used mechanistically ."" This explanation was given in relation to the starting points as they applied to adult offenders. The principles apply equally to young offenders. Until 2022 the only starting point in relation to offenders under 18 was 12 years. The Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Act 2022 changed the position for children convicted of murder. Paragraph 5A was added to Schedule 21. This created a sliding scale of minimum terms for children of different ages. The scale corresponded to the different levels of minimum terms applicable to adults. Where an adult has taken a weapon to the scene intending to commit an offence or to have it available for use as a weapon, the starting point will be 25 years. In relation to a child, the starting point will vary depending on their age. The lowest starting point on the sliding scale in those circumstances is 13 years which applies to offenders aged 14 or under. This court has considered the effect of the starting points in paragraph 5A. In SK [2022] EWCA Crim 1421 the court had to consider the sentence imposed on an offender aged 16 at the date of the offence. He had taken a weapon to the scene and had used it to kill someone. One issue was whether the starting point (which was predicated on age) also encompassed maturity of a young offender. The court stated that the principles set out in Peters [2005] 2 Cr App R (S) 101 remain valid, in particular what was said at [11]: ""Therefore although the normal starting point is governed by the defendant's age, when assessing his culpability, the sentencing judge should reflect on and make allowances, as appropriate upwards or downwards, for the level of the offender's maturity."" This was quoted with approval in Kamarra-Jarra [2024] EWCA Crim 198 . In that case the Lady Chief Justice went on to say: ""As has been said repeatedly, the starting points in paragraphs 2 to 6 of Schedule 21 are not to be applied mechanistically, but in a flexible way so as to achieve a just result."" Paragraph 5A would create serious problems if the starting points referable to those of different ages were to be applied mechanistically. Taking the starting points where the offender has taken a weapon to the scene as an example, there is a starting point of 23 years where the offender is aged 17, 17 years for those aged 15 or 16 and 13 years for offenders aged 14 and under. Was it intended that these starting points should not be subject to adjustment before consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors? That was not the conclusion in Hunt [2024] EWCA Crim 629 where the court said this: ""The issue which arises in this case is the divergence between the minimum terms for a 14 year old, albeit one close to their 15th birthday, and for a 17-year-old who has another six months to go until their 18th birthday. Applying paragraph 5A arithmetically leads to a 10-year difference in the minimum terms for a murder committed using a weapon brought to the scene. This divergence is not the result, as it used to be, of a single starting point for the minimum term applying for every offence of murder committed by an offender under 18. Rather, the divergence is the result of the statutory scheme designed to cure what was seen to be the potential injustice created by a single minimum term for offenders under 18 when the offence was committed. The proposition being argued in this case must be that the statutory scheme itself is unjust. In oral argument Miss Jones on behalf of Tyler Hunt invited us to find that the table in Schedule 21 paragraph 5A does not reflect a case where different age groups appear together. We do not accept that proposition. Very many, if not almost all cases of murder, involving those under 18 are cases where two or more such young people are charged together. The notion that Parliament set out this schedule simply to deal with cases where a single offender was being sentenced is not tenable. Had that been Parliament's intention it would have said so in clear terms. It seems to us that the answer to the conundrum is what was said in Kamarra-Jarra . A judge sentencing two offenders for an offence of murder where both were under 18 when they committed the offence must look beyond mere chronological age. We take the ages of Hunt and D as an example. It might be that the older offender took the leading role in the offence and demonstrated a level of maturity at or beyond his chronological age, whereas the younger offender played a subsidiary part in the offence and lacked maturity. In those circumstances it may be that little adjustment would be needed to the starting points in paragraph 5A, prior to the consideration of other aggravating and mitigating factors. Where the younger offender showed maturity and played an active role in the murder, as opposed to the lesser role being played by an immature older offender, the position will be different. It will always be a matter for the judgment of the sentencing judge to balance the different factors to achieve a just result whilst taking into account the statutory framework provided by paragraph 5A."" Mr Jarvis argued that these various authorities now must be subject to what was said in Ratcliffe [2024] EWCA Crim 1498 . We note that the judgment in that case was delivered by the Lady Chief Justice who also gave the judgment in Kamarra-Jarra. Mr Jarvis pointed to what was said at [57]: ""(1) If 20 years is the appropriate starting point in the applicant's case, having regard to the matters set out in paragraphs 3 to 5A of Schedule 21, it does not cease to be so merely because Scarlett's culpability was greater than that of the applicant. In those circumstances, the role played by each of Scarlett and the applicant in the murder would be a matter to be taken into account when considering the aggravating and mitigating factors. (2) In choosing 20 years as the appropriate starting point, the judge took account of the applicant's age to the extent provided for by paragraphs 3 to 5A of Schedule 21, since those paragraphs provide for different starting points in the case of offences of particularly high seriousness committed by defendants who are 18 or older (30 years), 17 (27 years), 15 or 16 (20 years) or 14 or younger (15 years)."" Once the appropriate starting point has been chosen, the offender's age and maturity may be a matter to be taken into account when considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, but they do not affect the choice of the appropriate starting point. As was said in R v Peters [12]: ""The first stage in the process nevertheless remains the prescribed statutory starting point. This ensures consistency of approach, and appropriate adherence to the relevant legislative provisions. Sch. 21 does not envisage a moveable starting point, upwards or downwards, from the dates fixed by reference to the offender's 18th or 21st birthdays. Nor does it provide a mathematical scale, The principle is simple. Where the offender's age, as it affects his culpability and the seriousness of the crime justifies it, a substantial, or even a very substantial discount, from the starting point may be appropriate. "" These observations were made in the context of an argument that, of the two offenders before the court, one was more culpable in terms of her instigation of and participation in the offence. The proposition was that this should have been reflected in different starting points. That proposition was clearly misconceived. There was no reason to apply a different starting point to an offender who was of a similar age and level of maturity as the offender said to be the leading light in the killing. The court in Ratcliffe cited Peters which remains the foundation of the court's approach to starting points when dealing with children and young people. The starting point with which we are concerned relates to all offenders aged 14 and under. It would be contrary to good sense and experience of how children change between the ages of 10 and 14 to apply a starting point of 13 years to every child from the age of criminal responsibility up to those about to reach their 15 th birthday. It may be that it is not a debate worth having given that the huge differences between a 10 year old and a 14 year old might be accommodated by dealing with them via mitigating factors. However, as a matter of principle and having regard to the way in which starting points in Schedule 21 are to be applied, we conclude that the starting point for offenders aged 14 and under must not be applied mechanistically. Cases in which offenders will be as young as 12 at the date of the offence will be very rare. That does not mean that the principle should not be applied properly. This principle should apply at all levels of the starting points in paragraph 5A. The application of the principles to this case We are not assisted by reference to the minimum term imposed in relation to two offenders who committed a murder in 1993. This predated the implementation of Schedule 21 by over 20 years. The sentencing landscape is very different in 2024. Minimum terms for the offence of murder now are generally far in excess of minimum terms as they were in 1993. That was the clear intention of Parliament when it enacted Schedule 21. Whether the legislature appreciated the effect that Schedule 21 would have on sentencing generally is not for us to say. We must reflect the legislative intention. Having said that, the introduction of paragraph 5A of the Schedule 21 recognises that, when an offender is very young, the appropriate minimum term will be dramatically shorter than that to be applied to an offender only four or five years older. The concept of a 12 year old offender being made the subject of a minimum term less than half of that which would apply to a 17 year old is consistent with the legislation. We do not agree with the submission that the starting point for the minimum term for an offender who was only just 12 at the date of the offence will be that identified in paragraph 5A for an offender aged 14 and under. Rather, it must be adjusted to reflect the age of the offender, namely barely 2 years over the age of criminal responsibility. In this case we consider that the judge would have been entitled to take a starting point of 11 years. In the case of the first offender his culpability was significantly reduced by the various factors set out in the reports available to the judge. The starting point required downward adjustment accordingly. We do not agree with Mr Jarvis's analysis on this point. The fact that the judge found that the offenders intended to kill Shawn does not mean that the first offender had any true appreciation of the consequences of his actions. Moreover, the absence of premeditation did not take account of the first offender's inability to control and regulate his emotions. However, we are satisfied that there were aggravating factors in respect of the first offender. Although the offenders were jointly in possession of the machete (as the jury's verdicts showed), the first offender was the one who had purchased it. He had gone home from school and taken it out with him when he went to meet the second offender. He had taken it away from the scene of the murder and cleaned off the blood. In consequence an uplift in the minimum term was appropriate. In our judgment the outcome ought to have been a minimum term in respect of the first offender of 10 years less time on remand. That would have reflected the balance of aggravating and mitigating factors. The second offender's minimum term could not reduced to the same extent as the first offender by reference to lack of maturity and the other matters set out in the reports concerning the first offender. Nonetheless, there was mitigation to be found in some aspects of his upbringing and in the way in which he had approached his time in custody. In respect of the latter feature, the judge was right to acknowledge this as something which required some modest reflection in the minimum term to be imposed. The aggravating factors which required an uplift in the case of the first offender did not apply to the second offender. As a result we find that the judge was right to apply the same minimum term to both offenders. Where we depart from her is in relation to the length of that minimum term. It should have been 10 years less time on remand for the second offender also. This was an enormously difficult sentencing exercise. We take into account that it was conducted by a High Court Judge who had seen and heard the offenders give evidence in the trial. The judge could not draw on any authority to assist her in identifying how and where the minimum term ought to be fixed. This was a case without parallel in recent times. We agree with the judge that an individualistic approach was essential. That was the approach mandated by the Children guideline which the judge was required to follow. Our view is that such an approach ought to have led to minimum terms greater than those she imposed. In a case where determinate terms had been imposed, a sentence of 8 ½ years' custody rather than 10 years' custody almost certainly would not be unduly lenient. This is not such a case. Each offender will have to serve the entirety of the minimum term. Moreover, an increase in the minimum term of 18 months is of real significance in the context of what are relatively short minimum terms by comparison with the great majority imposed pursuant to Schedule 21. It follows that we conclude that (a) the minimum terms imposed were unduly lenient and (b) we should not exercise our residual discretion to leave the sentences unaltered. Conclusion We shall quash the minimum terms imposed by the judge. In the case of each offender we shall substitute a minimum term of 9 years 50 days. This takes account of the time spent on remand which must be deducted from the period which otherwise would be fixed as the minimum term.

Two co-accused, Simon Williams and Neisha Williams, were acquitted of murder; Neisha was convicted of false imprisonment and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment; Simon Williams was acquitted of false imprisonment and a count which lay against him alone of kidnapping. The appellant's applications for leave to appeal against conviction were referred to this Court by the Registrar. We granted leave to appeal in the course of the hearing before us. The deceased was a woman called Katrina Taylor. Simon and Neisha Williams were brother and sister. The appellant Smith was the father of Neisha's children, and the appellant Scollan was his friend and flatmate. There was a serious burglary at Neisha's home and all four co-accused were anxious to find out who had committed it. They discovered that the perpetrators were the deceased, Katrina Taylor and two male associates. For several weeks the deceased hid. But eventually Simon Williams spotted her outside a hotel and persuaded her to get into his car and accompany him to his home where his sister Neisha was. She telephoned the appellants. They came to the house. The deceased remained in the house for several hours. Her body was discovered early the following morning, in a nearby churchyard. She had been stabbed through the heart. There was a cut-throat defence between the two pairs of accused. On the one hand, Simon and Neisha Williams, who said that the deceased had left the house with the appellants who had subsequently returned without her, and the appellants, who said that the deceased had left the house with Simon Williams who had subsequently returned without her. The facts in a little more detail were these. The deceased was a heroin addict. On 8th May 1996, together with a man called Laurie and another called Cosham, she broke into Neisha Williams' house, in Brighton, while Neisha and her children were away. A number of electrical items were stolen. Later, the burglars returned and, in the course of stealing the washing machine, flooded the house and also set fire to the furniture. The next day, Neisha returned. She was angry at what she discovered. She rang the appellant Smith from her sister's house and asked him to come down to Brighton from London. She said to her sister ""Whoever did this is dead"". Later that day, she was told that the deceased's sister Kerry knew who was responsible for the burglary. She asked that Neisha visit her alone. Neisha arrived 20 minutes later at Kerry's house, with Simon Williams and their brother Jason, the two appellants and two men called Wallace and Fleming. Kerry told them that Laurie had done the burglary, but she insisted that the deceased had had nothing to do with it. The group, particularly the appellant Scollan, were described as angry and aggressive. They demanded information as to Laurie's whereabouts and went off in search of him. There was evidence that, over the next day or two, an angry group, of which both appellants were part, searched for the burglars, including the deceased, generated fear and used violence, which included stabbing Cosham in the leg with a screwdriver. Thereafter, the appellants returned to London. But Simon Williams continued, over the next few weeks, looking for the deceased, and saying that he was going to 'get her'. Neisha had not reported the burglary to the police but the deceased's sister Kerry had. In consequence, Laurie was arrested and detained in custody. The deceased was arrested, but she was bailed to a hostel in Brighton. On 4th July the crucial events occurred. At that time, because of the damage to her house, Neisha had moved into her brother Simon's house, at 77 Centurion Road, Brighton. For about a week before 4th July, her children had been staying with the appellant Smith, in London, and on the 4th he brought them back to Brighton by train, accompanied by Scollan. Meanwhile, at about 6.00 pm, Simon Williams spotted the deceased sitting on the steps outside a hotel in Brighton. He stopped his car. He got out. The deceased ran away into the hotel. According to the manageress, she said ""that black guy is going to kill me"". Williams went into the hotel and the deceased said, according to the manageress, ""Don't hurt me, I know you're going to hurt me."" The manageress said in her police statement that Williams had dragged the deceased to the car. But in evidence she said the deceased had gone under her own steam. Williams' girlfriend, Sarah Jackson, gave evidence that, in the car, the deceased denied having had anything to do with the burglary and kept saying ""Don't do anything to me"". At all events, she went in the car to Centurion Road and arrived there at about 6.15. According to Sarah Jackson, she went in of her own volition. Neisha was inside. There were angry words between her and the deceased, the culmination of which was that the deceased admitted having sold a stereo system, belonging to Neisha, she, the deceased, having acted as lookout at the burglary. It was agreed that the deceased would pay Neisha for her losses at £10 a fortnight, out of her Giro cheque. However, within a very short time of the deceased having arrived at No 77, Neisha had made a telephone call to the appellant Smith, on his mobile telephone. At that time, he was on the train with Scollan travelling from Brighton to London. He got as far as East Croydon. Having had the telephone conversation with Neisha, he and the appellant Scollan disembarked from the train and returned to Brighton. They had been told that the deceased was at No 77. To that house they returned at about 7.30. Sarah Jackson described them as hostile. At one stage, she had gone upstairs. She said she heard Neisha come upstairs and say through the door, ""Trevor has got a knife out"". Sarah left that house at about 8 15; Simon Williams drove her home. Thereafter, apart from the deceased, there were only the four accused in that house. There was no direct evidence of what occurred between that time and the death of the deceased. It appears that her body, which was found in the nearby churchyard the following morning at 8.00 am, had not been there at 10.45 pm the previous evening. There was evidence of a disturbance, including screaming, in the churchyard, at around 11.15 pm the previous evening. The pathologist's evidence was that the deceased had been stabbed five times with a knife, and her death had been almost instantaneous following two stab wounds to the heart. The time of death was estimated at between 10.30 pm and 3.30 am. There were two possible scenarios, the pathologist said, as to how that death had occurred: either she had been held by one man from behind while another stabbed her from the front, or one tall, strong man had held her from behind with his left arm and stabbed her in the front with his right. She must have been restrained because there were very few defensive wounds to her hands and arms. There would be little or no bloodstaining on her attacker or on the knife. At about midnight, on the night of the murder, the appellants, who had missed the last train back to London, persuaded Simon Williams to drive them from Brighton to London Victoria. He then returned to Brighton. They caught the night bus to their home in Cricklewood. From there they went by taxi to Purley Avenue where their girlfriends were. They arrived at about 3.00 am, offering no explanation for being so late. Smith's girlfriend, Jennifer Ioannou, gave evidence. Her diary was exhibited. It had an entry purporting to show that Smith had spent the whole of the evening of 4th July with her. She gave evidence that both the appellants spent the weekend of 6th to 8th July at her home and they were ""subdued"". On 6th July, Smith telephoned a police station to contact Neisha, following the arrest of Simon Williams for the murder. On 9th July, Ioannou gave evidence of them all being together in a taxi when Scollan received a telephone call from his brother. As a result, she gave the appellants the key to her house while she went on to work. On the evening of 9th July, they asked if they could use her father's flat, which was some distance away. She agreed, and there the appellants lay low until they were arrested by the police on 24th July. Ioannou said they told her they were afraid of people who might be coming from Brighton, though she also said she knew the police had raided their home on 9th July and that they were hiding from the police. She gave evidence that she had had a conversation with both appellants about them going to Cyprus, and Smith had asked if extradition was possible from Cyprus, and passports had also been discussed. There was a further event on 9th July, in that Scollan told his girlfriend, Caroline O'Callaghan, that their relationship was at an end and he could no longer see her. There was evidence that Simon Williams disposed of the knife which was the murder weapon down a drain. It had come from No 77 Centurion Road. In due course he gave evidence of trying to destroy it with bolt cutters. The tip of the knife was found beneath the linoleum in the kitchen at No 77. Simon Williams was arrested on 6th July while he was driving Neisha and her children. He was told he was being arrested for the murder of the deceased. Telephone records showed that Neisha spoke to Smith that night. Smith was to maintain that he believed that Williams had only been arrested for kidnapping but the Crown contended that it was inconceivable that he should have so understood matters, because he must have known from Neisha that the arrest was for murder. The appellants were arrested at Ioannou's flat in Dutton Hall on 24th July, and Scollan said at that stage ""Who grassed us up?"" Neisha was interviewed on 6th July, as a witness. She lied in almost every respect. The following day she was arrested for murder and re-interviewed. On the advice of her solicitor, she made no comment. The judge described that advice as wholly bad and directed the jury to draw no inference adverse to her from her failure to answer questions. Simon Williams was interviewed on a number of occasions and told lies. He admitted having picked up the deceased on the seafront, but said he had let her go. He denied that she had been to his house and denied that the appellants had been there at the relevant time. He claimed, in evidence, that he had lied because he was frightened of the appellants. The appellant Smith was interviewed on 24th July. He said he dropped off his children on the 4th and had returned to London early in the evening and had not returned. He agreed he was looking for the perpetrators of the burglary about which he was angry; he wanted to beat them up. He claimed to have last seen the deceased the previous year. He claimed that he and Scollan had hidden from the police because they had cannabis plants at their home in Cricklewood, which they knew the police had raided. He agreed, eventually, that he knew because of a telephone conversation with Scollan's brother that they were wanted for murder. In evidence he accepted that he had told lies in interview but said that was because he realised Simon Williams must have killed the deceased and he was afraid that he too might be killed. Scollan was interviewed the day after his arrest. He refused to answer questions. He read a prepared statement to the effect that he was not guilty but he was extremely frightened and he would explain everything in court. Before the jury Simon Williams gave evidence. He agreed that he had chased the deceased into the hotel on 4th July, but said she had got into his car willingly. There had been a shouting match when they had first reached No 77, but it had calmed down once the deceased admitted responsibility for the burglary and agreed to repayment. He knew that Neisha had telephoned Smith and he said that when the appellants arrived they were questioning the deceased in a bossy manner, but later on everything in the house was quiet, when he took Sarah home. When he returned things were much the same. He and others had smoked cannabis. The deceased had stayed there until about 10.30, when the appellants had left to catch their train and the deceased had left with them. About half-an-hour later, the appellants had returned. Scollan had gone straight to the bathroom. Smith said they had missed the train and the deceased was dead. He had reluctantly agreed to drive them to London. During the journey very little was said, except that Scollan had said that he should get rid of the knife. He had returned to Brighton and had gone to bed. The following day he had gone to work as usual but he heard local news which reminded him of his conversation about the knife with Scollan. Having failed to destroy it with bolt cutters, he had disposed of it down a drain, as we have said. Neisha Williams gave evidence that she and Smith had lived together until 1995. She told him about the burglary because she wanted money from him to replace the missing and damaged items, and he had been extremely angry about the fact that the children might have been injured by the house being set on fire. On 4th July the appellants had brought the children back from London and then gone off to catch the 5.50 pm train from Brighton. Just after 6.00, her brother had brought the deceased to the house, and she had immediately telephoned Smith on his mobile telephone. Her explanation for that was that if he had discovered that the deceased had been in the house and he had not been told, he would have been very angry. She claimed that the deceased had remained in the flat throughout that evening of her own free will and no one had tried to stop her leaving. When the appellants arrived, Smith was very angry, shouting at the deceased and, at one stage, Scollan had fetched a knife from the kitchen which he held against the deceased's throat. She had gone upstairs at that stage to tell Simon what was happening. She said she was too scared to interfere. She learnt that the deceased was supposed to be back at her bail hostel by 11.00 pm. The appellants left with the deceased, and she Neisha noticed the knife was missing. But she had no idea what the appellants had in mind for the deceased. After some time the appellants returned. Scollan went to the basement, where the bathroom was. Smith appeared sweaty, edgy and frightened. She was not told that the deceased was dead. Later, during the journey of the three of them driven by Williams to London, she spoke to Smith on his mobile telephone. He told her to tell anyone who asked that he had not been in Brighton that day. Thereafter, Smith had telephoned her many times and reiterated that she was to say that. She stuck to that lie in the statement which she made to the police on 6th July. She had remained on affectionate terms with him until 4 months before the trial, when she discovered his relationship with Ioannou and, at that stage, she said she decided to tell the truth. The appellant Smith gave evidence that he had two previous convictions for robbery, in the course of which knives had been used by his co-accused. He described his relationship with Neisha, and admitted that he wanted to find out who the perpetrators of the burglary were and to beat them up. He described the telephone call during his train journey back to London on 4th July. He said he had agreed to return and persuaded Scollan to go with him for company. When they got to Centurion Road, at about 7.30, the deceased was crying and Neisha was shouting at her. Everything was resolved however by about 8.00 pm, and they sat around smoking cannabis and watching television. He checked that the last train was about 11.00, but he wanted some more cannabis and was waiting for that to arrive. The deceased said she had to be back at her hostel by 11.00 pm and Simon Williams went off with her. He returned after 40 or 50 minutes. He appeared perfectly normal and in due course he reluctantly agreed to drive them back to London. Smith agreed that he had made many telephone calls during the journey, including several to Neisha, but he denied that involved any discussion as to what had happened to the deceased. He went on to describe going to Cricklewood and events at Jennifer Ioannou's house. The following day he had again had many telephone calls with Neisha. That was quite normal; they were in relation to the children. He said, when he spoke to her on 6th July, she told him that Simon Williams had been arrested for kidnapping the deceased. Nothing was said of him having been arrested for murder. It was not until the morning of 9th July, when he heard about the police raid on his home, that he knew the deceased was dead. He feared that he was in danger from Simon Williams, whom he believed to be the murderer. He agreed discussing with Jennifer about going to Cyprus but that was just for a holiday. He agreed lying in interview, but that was because of fear of Simon Williams, and he denied persuading Jennifer Ioannou to make false entries in her diary with a view to providing him with an alibi. He agreed that, while in custody, he had written a large number of letters to Neisha, intended to 'keep her sweet' and to persuade her to stick to her story that he had not been in Brighton. He was cross-examined by Scollan's counsel, in terms to which we shall later come, as to the date when he first knew about the murder. The appellant Scollan gave evidence which accorded with that of Smith. In particular, he too said that he first knew about the murder on 9th July. He said, by reference to his comment to the police on arrest ""Who grassed us up?"" that he was referring to the disclosure of their hiding place. His reason for failing to answer questions in interview was his extreme fear of Simon Williams. We turn to the appeal. Not all the matters canvassed in the grounds of appeal of the two appellants were argued before us. Mr Nutting QC, for Smith, in four submissions, the first three of which were adopted by Mr Batten QC, for Scollan, contended, first, that there was no case to answer on murder and false imprisonment and the judge was wrong to reject a submission to that effect at the close of the prosecution case. The judge, having reviewed the evidence showing, as was conceded, that the appellants were part of a group, searching for the deceased, and offering violence to others believed to be involved in the burglary, was entitled to conclude that there was evidence of the appellants being party to an agreement to punish the deceased. But, submitted Mr Nutting, in the absence of any evidence as to who took the knife from the house and as to who knew it had been taken, the judge was not entitled to conclude that there was evidence that either of the appellants was party to an agreement to kill the deceased or cause her serious harm with a knife. Although there was evidence the deceased was being held against her will at No 77, there was no evidence that she had actually been injured there. In the light of authority since these appellants were tried, R v Powell and English [1997] 3 WLR, R v Appleby (unreported, 23rd January 1998) and R v Uddin (unreported, 19th March 1998), Mr Nutting submitted there were two issues for the judge to consider: was there evidence showing a joint enterprise to kill or cause serious harm? Was there evidence that the use of knives was foreseen or contemplated by those in the joint enterprise? He submitted that the judge's conclusion that ""all four must have realised, must have been aware that this girl was being taken from the house and that a knife was being taken at the same time"" was not supported by any evidence. Mr Batten QC added to this submission that the pathologist's evidence was that there could have been one, two, three or four involved in the stabbing, and although the knife came from No 77, there was no evidence as to the expectations of anyone remaining in the house when the girl was taken out. For the Crown, Mr Bevan QC submitted there was ample evidence to implicate both appellants in a plan to cause at least grievous bodily harm to Katrina Taylor by stabbing her. She had been kept in the house beyond the time when she was due back at her hostel; the knife which stabbed her was taken from the house beforehand and back there afterwards. Prima facie , the four in the house were party to the joint enterprise to stab. These events occurred against a background which included a burglary and fire effecting Smith's former girlfriend and his children, Scollan being a close friend and flatmate of Smith, both being part of a group seeking revenge against the burglars and both being present when Cosham was stabbed with a screwdriver. Katrina Taylor was petrified when she was spotted by Simon Williams and taken to No 77. When telephoned by Neisha, both appellants left their London bound train and returned to No 77, remaining in Brighton until after the last London train had gone. Eventually, following repeated telephone contact with Neisha during their car journey to London while driven by Williams, and having first paid a visit to their flat, the appellants reached their girlfriends at 3.00 am without any explanation. On 6th July, Smith had spoken to Neisha following Simon Williams' arrest for murder in her presence. On the 9th, following a further telephone call, the appellants had made arrangements to hide, and had discussed fleeing the country. On arrest, Smith had lied about when he had last seen the deceased and Scollan had said nothing in interview. In our judgment, when the terms of the very full ruling which the judge gave are read as a whole, he directed himself correctly in accordance with both the law, as it was at the time of trial, and the law in the subsequent authorities to which Mr Nutting referred: that is, that there must be evidence in relation to each defendant that he was party to an agreement to cause the death of or serious harm to Katrina Taylor by the use of a knife. See in particular the transcripts of his ruling at page 6F-G, 7E-F, 10B-C, 10G-11B, 12A-C, 14F, 15E-F, 18G-19A and 19D-F. Furthermore, we are satisfied that the circumstantial evidence identified by Mr Bevan afforded, cumulatively, a proper and sufficient case for the jury to consider against both appellants in relation both to murder and false imprisonment. The judge was therefore right to reject the defence submissions and ground 1 fails. Mr Nutting's second submission was that the judge's directions in relation to character were defective in four respects. First, he failed to remind the jury of the contents of an exhibited pink file which spoke of Smith's charity work. Secondly, he failed to refer to the evidence of a prison officer as to Smith's exemplary behaviour in custody. Thirdly, he failed to direct the jury that the appellants' previous convictions in relation to knives were relevant only to his credibility, and not to propensity. Fourthly, the credibility of Simon and Neisha Williams, whose evidence was crucial to the case against Smith and Scollan, was unfairly highlighted by the last minute direction at the end of the summing-up, prompted by prosecuting counsel, that the Williamses were of good character: the defence was therefore undermined. There is no substance in the first two of these complaints. The judge was under no obligation to rehearse all the evidence. As to previous convictions in relation to knives, the relevant passage in the summing-up is at page 129C-G. Having referred to Scollan's convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and carrying a knife, and to Smith's two convictions for robbery when knives were used, the judge said: ""The significance of that evidence that he had been involved in criminal activities when knives were used, as relied upon by Miss Woodley and Mr Kershen, is pretty obvious, but I need hardly say to you that you do not decide this case one way or the other on the existence or absence of previous convictions, you decide this case, as I have told you, on the evidence in this case. One of the basic principles of English criminal law, both of law and indeed of justice, is that we do not convict people on their records. You do not give a dog a bad name and hang him. The relevance of that evidence is to enable you to put into context the nature, character and personality of the persons who make these allegations against their co-defendants, enabling you to decide where you think the truth lies. It may also enable you to put into context the truthfulness or otherwise of Mr Smith's assertion that he made to Mr Bevan at the very outset of his cross-examination [that he was not a violent man]."" Mr Bevan accepted that the phrase ""the significance is pretty obvious"" was unfortunate. But he submitted, this passage, read as a whole, made it plain that the jury could only convict on evidence and not past record. We cannot agree. It seems to us that, the judge having first said that the significance of knives was ""pretty obvious"", he did not, as he might have done, remedy the situation by giving an express direction that the knives' convictions were of no significance, save as to credibility. This passage in the summing-up, in our judgment, amounted to a misdirection. The direction about the Williamses' character came about in this way. The judge having concluded his summing-up, Mr Bevan drew attention to the provisions in Archbold arising from R v Nye 75 Cr App R 247, and the circumstances in which a person with convictions might be entitled to present himself as being of good character. The point had not apparently been canvassed by anyone at an earlier stage. Mr Bevan said, at the summing-up transcript page 157A: ""Your Lordship will forgive me if I have this wrong. In so far as Neisha Williams is concerned I think the jury know the position so far as character is concerned; one shoplifting. [THE JUDGE]: One shoplifting. And you would be content I treated her as a woman of good character. MR BEVAN: I would. The same in the case of Simon Williams stealing a bicycle, and the same would apply. [THE JUDGE]: Very well. I will so do. Ladies and gentlemen, let me explain. Mr Bevan is content, because of the relatively minor nature of those convictions, that both Simon Williams and his sister should be treated as being persons of good character."" The judge went on to give what, if it was appropriate, was a full and entirely correct direction as to the effect of the Williamses' good character, in that it supported their credibility and made it less likely they would be involved in serious criminal activity than persons not having a good character. The jury then retired. In the context of a cut-throat defence between the Williams, on the one hand, and the appellants on the other, this direction, it was submitted, was highly prejudicial to the appellants, particularly in its timing immediately before the jury retired. Mr Bevan plainly prompted the judge from the very best of motives, with a view to being fair to the Williamses. But the subject, as it seems to us, merited much earlier consideration, if the judge was to be in a position to exercise his discretion properly, in deciding whether or not, in all the circumstances of the case, a good character direction ought to be given in relation to the Williamses. With time for argument and reflection, he might have decided not to give such a direction at all. Mr Bevan, with characteristic candour, accepts, with the benefit of hindsight, that perhaps he should not have intervened as he did. In our judgment, coming when it did, the judge's good character direction about the Williamses was potentially significantly prejudicial to the defence of the appellants, in that it bolstered the Williamses' version of events. Mr Nutting's third submission was that the judge gave no adequate warning as to the dangers of relying on Sarah Jackson's evidence because of the interests she might wish to serve as Simon Williams' girlfriend in minimising his role and maximising the roles of the appellants. This was particularly prejudicial because he gave such a warning in relation to the appellants' girlfriends Ioannou and O'Callaghan in these terms, at transcript page 93C-E: ""Jennifer Ioannou was still very sympathetically inclined towards Trevor Smith and regarded themselves as they told you, as being engaged, and indeed Caroline O'Callaghan still feels an attachment towards Mr Scollan in so far as she has been visiting them at High Down. So that if and in so far as you think any of that part of the girls' evidence was intended to cast aspersions on either Simon or Neisha Williams you may be inclined to the view, it is a matter for you, that there may be some element of favouritism in that aspect of their evidence and you may want to think about it and treat it with a good deal of reserve."" Mr Batten stressed that Sarah Jackson was a very important witness in favour of Simon Williams, in that she gave the alleged kidnapping a voluntary character, and against the appellants in describing a worsening atmosphere after their return to No 77 on the evening of the 4th. Mr Bevan drew attention to a passage earlier in the summing-up where, when dealing with witnesses generally, the judge referred to some of them having ""had some inclinations or associations that may have affected an even handed approach"". It is to be noted that in this passage the judge said he would ""look at it later on"". In the event, as we have said, he gave directions urging caution in relation to the appellants' girlfriends, but gave no such direction in relation to Sarah Jackson, who helped Simon Williams. In our judgment, this was a non-direction, giving rise to the possibility of prejudice against the appellants. Mr Nutting's fourth submission related only to Smith and was based on alleged inadequacies in the summing-up about the letters passing between Smith and Neisha which, it is common ground, were intended to 'keep her sweet' and which were said to show she did not fear him. We find no inadequacy in the judge's reference to the letters, which were all in the jury's possession. That ground was unarguable. Mr Batten made the running, supported by Mr Nutting, on a ground of appeal critical of the conduct of junior counsel, leading for Scollan's defence at trial. It is expressed in the grounds of appeal in this way: ""The convictions are unsafe having regard to the manner in which a crucial aspect of Scollan's instructions was dealt with by counsel during the trial."" Prior to the hearing of the appeal, this Court had been supplied with an affidavit by leading counsel for Smith, exhibiting certain contemporaneous documents and a confirmatory affidavit from his junior and explanatory letters, but no documents, from Scollan's counsel, who indicated, however, that relevant notebooks and notes were in existence. At the outset of the hearing before us, we directed that these notebooks and notes should be disclosed to counsel and the Court, and they were. They are detailed and, apparently, comprehensive. We mention these matters because they explain the way in which this ground, as pursued before the Court, particularly on behalf of Scollan, differed markedly from counsel's skeleton argument. This had been based on Scollan's own initial handwritten ground that his barrister failed to follow his instructions as to the date on which he first knew about the murder. In the light of the material in counsel's notes and following an adjournment to consult his client, Mr Batten accepted that this ground could not be pursued on this basis. It could not be said that counsel did something without foundation and was seriously at fault so as to support an allegation of flagrant incompetence such as the authorities describe. Despite Scollan's sense of grievance persistently expressed during the trial and subsequently, Mr Batten accepted that it was difficult to contend before this Court that there was more than a misunderstanding between client and counsel. However, he submitted, what occurred was within the terms of what Rougier J said in giving the judgment of this Court in R v Clinton (1993) 97 Cr App R 320 at 326. Having referred to R v Gautam [1988] Crim LR 109, R v Wellings (20th December 1991) and other authorities, all decided prior to the amendment of section 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 , Rougier J said this: ""We think that the proper interpretation of the cases to which we have referred is that the Court was doing no more than providing general guidelines as to the correct approach. The Court was rightly concerned to emphasise that where counsel had made decisions in good faith after proper consideration of the competing arguments, and, where appropriate after due discussion with his client, such decisions could not possibly be said to render a subsequent verdict unsafe or unsatisfactory. Particularly does this apply to the decision as to whether or not to call the defendant. Conversely and, we stress, exceptionally where it is shown that the decision was taken either in defiance of or without proper instructions, or when all the promptings of reason and good sense pointed the other way, it may be open to an appellate Court to set aside the verdict by reason of the terms of section 2 (1)(a) of the Act . It is probably less helpful to approach the problem via the somewhat semantic exercise of trying to assess the qualitative value of counsel's alleged ineptitude, but rather to seek to assess its effect on the trial and the verdict according to the terms of the subsection."" In our judgment, those observations are of continuing validity, despite the change of wording in section 2 (1), by virtue of the provisions of the 1995 Act. The particular passage in the judgment upon which reliance in the present case is placed is the reference to ""without proper instructions"". In the light of all the material before this Court, the following nine matters now seem plain: 1. Scollan's original proof stated that he first knew of the murder on the date the police raided his home, which was 9th July. 2. Scollan, as his counsel knew, was, throughout, most anxious that his defence should be run in tandem with that of Smith. 3. His instructions in conference with counsel on 16th July, repeated in further conference on 22nd July, were that 9th July was the date of his first knowledge. 4. During the conference on 16th July, Scollan's counsel had pointed out to him, in forceful terms, that the evidence, particularly in relation to the telephone call which Smith made on 6th July, following Williams' arrest for murder, to a police station where Neisha was, strongly suggested that Smith must have known of the murder on the 6th, and must have passed this on to his friend and flat mate Scollan. Scollan's response to this, recorded in counsel's note, was ""I can't remember if Trevor passed on this information to me, about Simon's arrest, but he must have."" 5. Smith having given evidence that he first knew on 9th July, Scollan's counsel cross-examined him, during the course of the trial on 23rd July, in these terms, transcript of evidence 2H: ""I want to put to you that Neisha told you on the 6th and possibly 7th July, more likely the 6th, that in fact Katrina Taylor was dead. A. That's not true. Q. And that you conveyed that information to Fergal Scollan? A. That is not true."" 6. That cross-examination evoked from Scollan in the dock immediate, apparent, dissent, in shaking his head as described by Smith's leading counsel in affidavit. It also caused consternation in Smith's legal team which led to vigorous exchanges between counsel for the two appellants, into the details of which it is unnecessary to go, save to say that each team came to believe that the other's client was seeking improperly to influence the conduct of their client's defence. 7. When Scollan gave evidence, he said that he first knew of the murder on 9th July. 8. At no stage did Scollan's counsel seek to give to the judge, jury or other counsel in the case, any explanation as to how the divergence between her cross-examination and his evidence had arisen. 9. That divergence formed the subject, as Mr Bevan told us, of vigorous comment by each of the leading counsel appearing for the two Williamses and by himself as counsel for the prosecution. The judge, in his summing-up, referred to the matter in this way, 147B-F: ""He [that is Scollan] also claimed that he also heard nothing about Katrina's death until his brother rang him on 9th July, and here is a second point, because as you were reminded about only yesterday, that is not what was put to Trevor Smith by Miss Belford on behalf of Mr Scollan. She suggested -- again it is suggested to you no doubt upon Mr Scollan's instructions, that they were told of Katrina's death on Saturday 6th July and not that he got to hear about it from his brother on the 9th, and the suggestion to you therefore is that here he has changed his story in order to conform to the evidence that Mr Smith had given everyone when he was in the witness box, and Mr Scollan heard him, and therefore you are invited to conclude that he also is not concerned to tell you the truth as he knows it to be, but to tell a story which so far as he possibly can conforms with that which Mr Smith has already said. It is a matter for you as to what you think about that."" We record as a matter of history, though it has no impact on the appeal that, on more than one occasion, including during the summing-up, there were conferences between Scollan and his counsel in which the merits of Scollan sacking her were discussed. In our judgment, in the light of these matters, Scollan is entitled to feel a sense of grievance that, for whatever reason, the cross-examination of Smith as to date of knowledge was not in accordance with his instructions. In itself this would afford no ground for appeal. But it is apparent, from the use made of this divergence by other counsel in the case and from the passage in the summing-up which we have read, that the divergence between the cross-examination on his behalf and the evidence which he gave, loomed large in the case, to the likely detriment of Scollan's credibility. Furthermore, as Mr Bevan rightly accepts, there was a serious knock-on effect so far as Smith was concerned. The prosecution case against him, that he had sought to persuade his girlfriend and Neisha to provide a false alibi for 4th July, that he was in the forefront of the group offering violence in the search for the burglars, and the evidence of Williams that they had lied to the police because of fear of Smith, would all have been supported if, as might well have appeared to the jury, Smith had been putting pressure on Scollan to change his account as to the date of knowledge. Furthermore, the judge rightly directed the jury that the cases of Smith and Scollan stood or fell together. In our judgment, highly unusual though the circumstances of this case on this aspect are, they give rise to concern that Scollan's apparent change of story, figuring in the case as significantly as it did, may well have prejudiced the jury against both him and Smith. The case against these appellants was formidable. The terms of the summing-up in relation to character and Sarah Jackson and counsel's cross-examination of Smith, would not, separately, have rendered these convictions unsafe. But their combined effect is such that we cannot be confident that, had the trial proceeded properly in relation to these three matters, the jury's verdicts would necessarily have been the same. It follows that we must regard the convictions as unsafe. Accordingly, the appeals of both appellants are allowed and their convictions are quashed. We should add that we have considered a letter from Scollan's counsel, dated 14th October, in which she makes an application for an order for costs in her favour, in relation to this appeal. All we propose to say is that, in the light of the judgment which we have given, such an order would not be appropriate, and that application is refused. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mr Nutting, is there any reason why there should not be a retrial? MR NUTTING: I have given that matter some thought, I am bound to admit that I can find no argument which would persuade, or might persuade, your Lordships not to make that order. MR DEIN: My Lord, we have nothing to say on the matter. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We shall direct that these appellants be retried. We direct that a fresh indictment be preferred, as soon as may be. Mr Bevan, so far as the place of retrial is concerned? MR BEVAN: That has concerned me. Your Lordship might appreciate, this trial was at Lewes. It attracted a considerable amount of local interest, press - I cannot speak about the media, but certainly a lot of newspaper attention. In my submission, it would be quite wrong for this trial to take place in that area, for that obvious reason. It is not very long ago. It was allegedly, or in fact, a nasty killing, whoever was responsible, and, in my submission, Lewes and that area is the wrong venue. I would respectfully submit that the Central Criminal Court would be the right court in this particular case. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Does anyone dissent from that? MR NUTTING: No, I was going to ask your Lordship for a section 4 (2) order. Contempt of Court Act section 4 (2) order, preventing publicity against the possibility that it was going to be tried in the area where publicity has been so necessarily and understandably current. But, in the circumstances of the application, if your Lordship is disposed to allow Mr Bevan's application, I do not think, in the circumstances, I need to make an application for that order. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We shall direct the trial take place at the Central Criminal Court. I expect legal aid would be sought for leading and junior counsel separately for each of these defendants on the retrial. We grant that. In the meantime, subject to any further application, they will remain in custody. MR NUTTING: Order for solicitors too. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, of course. In relation to both appellants. Is there anything else we need to deal with? I am told we ought to direct they be re-arraigned within a period of 2 months, and we do so direct. © 1998 Crown Copyright BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1998/2895.html","Scollan & Anor, R v [1998] EWCA Crim 2895 (15th October, 1998) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions FERGAL PATRICK SCOLLAN TREVOR WILLIAM SMITH, R v.

Two co-accused, Simon Williams and Neisha Williams, were acquitted of murder; Neisha was convicted of false imprisonment and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment; Simon Williams was acquitted of false imprisonment and a count which lay against him alone of kidnapping. The appellant's applications for leave to appeal against conviction were referred to this Court by the Registrar. We granted leave to appeal in the course of the hearing before us. The deceased was a woman called Katrina Taylor. Simon and Neisha Williams were brother and sister. The appellant Smith was the father of Neisha's children, and the appellant Scollan was his friend and flatmate. There was a serious burglary at Neisha's home and all four co-accused were anxious to find out who had committed it. They discovered that the perpetrators were the deceased, Katrina Taylor and two male associates. For several weeks the deceased hid. But eventually Simon Williams spotted her outside a hotel and persuaded her to get into his car and accompany him to his home where his sister Neisha was. She telephoned the appellants. They came to the house. The deceased remained in the house for several hours. Her body was discovered early the following morning, in a nearby churchyard. She had been stabbed through the heart. There was a cut-throat defence between the two pairs of accused. On the one hand, Simon and Neisha Williams, who said that the deceased had left the house with the appellants who had subsequently returned without her, and the appellants, who said that the deceased had left the house with Simon Williams who had subsequently returned without her. The facts in a little more detail were these. The deceased was a heroin addict. On 8th May 1996, together with a man called Laurie and another called Cosham, she broke into Neisha Williams' house, in Brighton, while Neisha and her children were away. A number of electrical items were stolen. Later, the burglars returned and, in the course of stealing the washing machine, flooded the house and also set fire to the furniture. The next day, Neisha returned. She was angry at what she discovered. She rang the appellant Smith from her sister's house and asked him to come down to Brighton from London. She said to her sister ""Whoever did this is dead"". Later that day, she was told that the deceased's sister Kerry knew who was responsible for the burglary. She asked that Neisha visit her alone. Neisha arrived 20 minutes later at Kerry's house, with Simon Williams and their brother Jason, the two appellants and two men called Wallace and Fleming. Kerry told them that Laurie had done the burglary, but she insisted that the deceased had had nothing to do with it. The group, particularly the appellant Scollan, were described as angry and aggressive. They demanded information as to Laurie's whereabouts and went off in search of him. There was evidence that, over the next day or two, an angry group, of which both appellants were part, searched for the burglars, including the deceased, generated fear and used violence, which included stabbing Cosham in the leg with a screwdriver. Thereafter, the appellants returned to London. But Simon Williams continued, over the next few weeks, looking for the deceased, and saying that he was going to 'get her'. Neisha had not reported the burglary to the police but the deceased's sister Kerry had. In consequence, Laurie was arrested and detained in custody. The deceased was arrested, but she was bailed to a hostel in Brighton. On 4th July the crucial events occurred. At that time, because of the damage to her house, Neisha had moved into her brother Simon's house, at 77 Centurion Road, Brighton. For about a week before 4th July, her children had been staying with the appellant Smith, in London, and on the 4th he brought them back to Brighton by train, accompanied by Scollan. Meanwhile, at about 6.00 pm, Simon Williams spotted the deceased sitting on the steps outside a hotel in Brighton. He stopped his car. He got out. The deceased ran away into the hotel. According to the manageress, she said ""that black guy is going to kill me"". Williams went into the hotel and the deceased said, according to the manageress, ""Don't hurt me, I know you're going to hurt me."" The manageress said in her police statement that Williams had dragged the deceased to the car. But in evidence she said the deceased had gone under her own steam. Williams' girlfriend, Sarah Jackson, gave evidence that, in the car, the deceased denied having had anything to do with the burglary and kept saying ""Don't do anything to me"". At all events, she went in the car to Centurion Road and arrived there at about 6.15. According to Sarah Jackson, she went in of her own volition. Neisha was inside. There were angry words between her and the deceased, the culmination of which was that the deceased admitted having sold a stereo system, belonging to Neisha, she, the deceased, having acted as lookout at the burglary. It was agreed that the deceased would pay Neisha for her losses at £10 a fortnight, out of her Giro cheque. However, within a very short time of the deceased having arrived at No 77, Neisha had made a telephone call to the appellant Smith, on his mobile telephone. At that time, he was on the train with Scollan travelling from Brighton to London. He got as far as East Croydon. Having had the telephone conversation with Neisha, he and the appellant Scollan disembarked from the train and returned to Brighton. They had been told that the deceased was at No 77. To that house they returned at about 7.30. Sarah Jackson described them as hostile. At one stage, she had gone upstairs. She said she heard Neisha come upstairs and say through the door, ""Trevor has got a knife out"". Sarah left that house at about 8 15; Simon Williams drove her home. Thereafter, apart from the deceased, there were only the four accused in that house. There was no direct evidence of what occurred between that time and the death of the deceased. It appears that her body, which was found in the nearby churchyard the following morning at 8.00 am, had not been there at 10.45 pm the previous evening. There was evidence of a disturbance, including screaming, in the churchyard, at around 11.15 pm the previous evening. The pathologist's evidence was that the deceased had been stabbed five times with a knife, and her death had been almost instantaneous following two stab wounds to the heart. The time of death was estimated at between 10.30 pm and 3.30 am. There were two possible scenarios, the pathologist said, as to how that death had occurred: either she had been held by one man from behind while another stabbed her from the front, or one tall, strong man had held her from behind with his left arm and stabbed her in the front with his right. She must have been restrained because there were very few defensive wounds to her hands and arms. There would be little or no bloodstaining on her attacker or on the knife. At about midnight, on the night of the murder, the appellants, who had missed the last train back to London, persuaded Simon Williams to drive them from Brighton to London Victoria. He then returned to Brighton. They caught the night bus to their home in Cricklewood. From there they went by taxi to Purley Avenue where their girlfriends were. They arrived at about 3.00 am, offering no explanation for being so late. Smith's girlfriend, Jennifer Ioannou, gave evidence. Her diary was exhibited. It had an entry purporting to show that Smith had spent the whole of the evening of 4th July with her. She gave evidence that both the appellants spent the weekend of 6th to 8th July at her home and they were ""subdued"". On 6th July, Smith telephoned a police station to contact Neisha, following the arrest of Simon Williams for the murder. On 9th July, Ioannou gave evidence of them all being together in a taxi when Scollan received a telephone call from his brother. As a result, she gave the appellants the key to her house while she went on to work. On the evening of 9th July, they asked if they could use her father's flat, which was some distance away. She agreed, and there the appellants lay low until they were arrested by the police on 24th July. Ioannou said they told her they were afraid of people who might be coming from Brighton, though she also said she knew the police had raided their home on 9th July and that they were hiding from the police. She gave evidence that she had had a conversation with both appellants about them going to Cyprus, and Smith had asked if extradition was possible from Cyprus, and passports had also been discussed. There was a further event on 9th July, in that Scollan told his girlfriend, Caroline O'Callaghan, that their relationship was at an end and he could no longer see her. There was evidence that Simon Williams disposed of the knife which was the murder weapon down a drain. It had come from No 77 Centurion Road. In due course he gave evidence of trying to destroy it with bolt cutters. The tip of the knife was found beneath the linoleum in the kitchen at No 77. Simon Williams was arrested on 6th July while he was driving Neisha and her children. He was told he was being arrested for the murder of the deceased. Telephone records showed that Neisha spoke to Smith that night. Smith was to maintain that he believed that Williams had only been arrested for kidnapping but the Crown contended that it was inconceivable that he should have so understood matters, because he must have known from Neisha that the arrest was for murder. The appellants were arrested at Ioannou's flat in Dutton Hall on 24th July, and Scollan said at that stage ""Who grassed us up?"" Neisha was interviewed on 6th July, as a witness. She lied in almost every respect. The following day she was arrested for murder and re-interviewed. On the advice of her solicitor, she made no comment. The judge described that advice as wholly bad and directed the jury to draw no inference adverse to her from her failure to answer questions. Simon Williams was interviewed on a number of occasions and told lies. He admitted having picked up the deceased on the seafront, but said he had let her go. He denied that she had been to his house and denied that the appellants had been there at the relevant time. He claimed, in evidence, that he had lied because he was frightened of the appellants. The appellant Smith was interviewed on 24th July. He said he dropped off his children on the 4th and had returned to London early in the evening and had not returned. He agreed he was looking for the perpetrators of the burglary about which he was angry; he wanted to beat them up. He claimed to have last seen the deceased the previous year. He claimed that he and Scollan had hidden from the police because they had cannabis plants at their home in Cricklewood, which they knew the police had raided. He agreed, eventually, that he knew because of a telephone conversation with Scollan's brother that they were wanted for murder. In evidence he accepted that he had told lies in interview but said that was because he realised Simon Williams must have killed the deceased and he was afraid that he too might be killed. Scollan was interviewed the day after his arrest. He refused to answer questions. He read a prepared statement to the effect that he was not guilty but he was extremely frightened and he would explain everything in court. Before the jury Simon Williams gave evidence. He agreed that he had chased the deceased into the hotel on 4th July, but said she had got into his car willingly. There had been a shouting match when they had first reached No 77, but it had calmed down once the deceased admitted responsibility for the burglary and agreed to repayment. He knew that Neisha had telephoned Smith and he said that when the appellants arrived they were questioning the deceased in a bossy manner, but later on everything in the house was quiet, when he took Sarah home. When he returned things were much the same. He and others had smoked cannabis. The deceased had stayed there until about 10.30, when the appellants had left to catch their train and the deceased had left with them. About half-an-hour later, the appellants had returned. Scollan had gone straight to the bathroom. Smith said they had missed the train and the deceased was dead. He had reluctantly agreed to drive them to London. During the journey very little was said, except that Scollan had said that he should get rid of the knife. He had returned to Brighton and had gone to bed. The following day he had gone to work as usual but he heard local news which reminded him of his conversation about the knife with Scollan. Having failed to destroy it with bolt cutters, he had disposed of it down a drain, as we have said. Neisha Williams gave evidence that she and Smith had lived together until 1995. She told him about the burglary because she wanted money from him to replace the missing and damaged items, and he had been extremely angry about the fact that the children might have been injured by the house being set on fire. On 4th July the appellants had brought the children back from London and then gone off to catch the 5.50 pm train from Brighton. Just after 6.00, her brother had brought the deceased to the house, and she had immediately telephoned Smith on his mobile telephone. Her explanation for that was that if he had discovered that the deceased had been in the house and he had not been told, he would have been very angry. She claimed that the deceased had remained in the flat throughout that evening of her own free will and no one had tried to stop her leaving. When the appellants arrived, Smith was very angry, shouting at the deceased and, at one stage, Scollan had fetched a knife from the kitchen which he held against the deceased's throat. She had gone upstairs at that stage to tell Simon what was happening. She said she was too scared to interfere. She learnt that the deceased was supposed to be back at her bail hostel by 11.00 pm. The appellants left with the deceased, and she Neisha noticed the knife was missing. But she had no idea what the appellants had in mind for the deceased. After some time the appellants returned. Scollan went to the basement, where the bathroom was. Smith appeared sweaty, edgy and frightened. She was not told that the deceased was dead. Later, during the journey of the three of them driven by Williams to London, she spoke to Smith on his mobile telephone. He told her to tell anyone who asked that he had not been in Brighton that day. Thereafter, Smith had telephoned her many times and reiterated that she was to say that. She stuck to that lie in the statement which she made to the police on 6th July. She had remained on affectionate terms with him until 4 months before the trial, when she discovered his relationship with Ioannou and, at that stage, she said she decided to tell the truth. The appellant Smith gave evidence that he had two previous convictions for robbery, in the course of which knives had been used by his co-accused. He described his relationship with Neisha, and admitted that he wanted to find out who the perpetrators of the burglary were and to beat them up. He described the telephone call during his train journey back to London on 4th July. He said he had agreed to return and persuaded Scollan to go with him for company. When they got to Centurion Road, at about 7.30, the deceased was crying and Neisha was shouting at her. Everything was resolved however by about 8.00 pm, and they sat around smoking cannabis and watching television. He checked that the last train was about 11.00, but he wanted some more cannabis and was waiting for that to arrive. The deceased said she had to be back at her hostel by 11.00 pm and Simon Williams went off with her. He returned after 40 or 50 minutes. He appeared perfectly normal and in due course he reluctantly agreed to drive them back to London. Smith agreed that he had made many telephone calls during the journey, including several to Neisha, but he denied that involved any discussion as to what had happened to the deceased. He went on to describe going to Cricklewood and events at Jennifer Ioannou's house. The following day he had again had many telephone calls with Neisha. That was quite normal; they were in relation to the children. He said, when he spoke to her on 6th July, she told him that Simon Williams had been arrested for kidnapping the deceased. Nothing was said of him having been arrested for murder. It was not until the morning of 9th July, when he heard about the police raid on his home, that he knew the deceased was dead. He feared that he was in danger from Simon Williams, whom he believed to be the murderer. He agreed discussing with Jennifer about going to Cyprus but that was just for a holiday. He agreed lying in interview, but that was because of fear of Simon Williams, and he denied persuading Jennifer Ioannou to make false entries in her diary with a view to providing him with an alibi. He agreed that, while in custody, he had written a large number of letters to Neisha, intended to 'keep her sweet' and to persuade her to stick to her story that he had not been in Brighton. He was cross-examined by Scollan's counsel, in terms to which we shall later come, as to the date when he first knew about the murder. The appellant Scollan gave evidence which accorded with that of Smith. In particular, he too said that he first knew about the murder on 9th July. He said, by reference to his comment to the police on arrest ""Who grassed us up?"" that he was referring to the disclosure of their hiding place. His reason for failing to answer questions in interview was his extreme fear of Simon Williams. We turn to the appeal. Not all the matters canvassed in the grounds of appeal of the two appellants were argued before us. Mr Nutting QC, for Smith, in four submissions, the first three of which were adopted by Mr Batten QC, for Scollan, contended, first, that there was no case to answer on murder and false imprisonment and the judge was wrong to reject a submission to that effect at the close of the prosecution case. The judge, having reviewed the evidence showing, as was conceded, that the appellants were part of a group, searching for the deceased, and offering violence to others believed to be involved in the burglary, was entitled to conclude that there was evidence of the appellants being party to an agreement to punish the deceased. But, submitted Mr Nutting, in the absence of any evidence as to who took the knife from the house and as to who knew it had been taken, the judge was not entitled to conclude that there was evidence that either of the appellants was party to an agreement to kill the deceased or cause her serious harm with a knife. Although there was evidence the deceased was being held against her will at No 77, there was no evidence that she had actually been injured there. In the light of authority since these appellants were tried, R v Powell and English [1997] 3 WLR, R v Appleby (unreported, 23rd January 1998) and R v Uddin (unreported, 19th March 1998), Mr Nutting submitted there were two issues for the judge to consider: was there evidence showing a joint enterprise to kill or cause serious harm? Was there evidence that the use of knives was foreseen or contemplated by those in the joint enterprise? He submitted that the judge's conclusion that ""all four must have realised, must have been aware that this girl was being taken from the house and that a knife was being taken at the same time"" was not supported by any evidence. Mr Batten QC added to this submission that the pathologist's evidence was that there could have been one, two, three or four involved in the stabbing, and although the knife came from No 77, there was no evidence as to the expectations of anyone remaining in the house when the girl was taken out. For the Crown, Mr Bevan QC submitted there was ample evidence to implicate both appellants in a plan to cause at least grievous bodily harm to Katrina Taylor by stabbing her. She had been kept in the house beyond the time when she was due back at her hostel; the knife which stabbed her was taken from the house beforehand and back there afterwards. Prima facie , the four in the house were party to the joint enterprise to stab. These events occurred against a background which included a burglary and fire effecting Smith's former girlfriend and his children, Scollan being a close friend and flatmate of Smith, both being part of a group seeking revenge against the burglars and both being present when Cosham was stabbed with a screwdriver. Katrina Taylor was petrified when she was spotted by Simon Williams and taken to No 77. When telephoned by Neisha, both appellants left their London bound train and returned to No 77, remaining in Brighton until after the last London train had gone. Eventually, following repeated telephone contact with Neisha during their car journey to London while driven by Williams, and having first paid a visit to their flat, the appellants reached their girlfriends at 3.00 am without any explanation. On 6th July, Smith had spoken to Neisha following Simon Williams' arrest for murder in her presence. On the 9th, following a further telephone call, the appellants had made arrangements to hide, and had discussed fleeing the country. On arrest, Smith had lied about when he had last seen the deceased and Scollan had said nothing in interview. In our judgment, when the terms of the very full ruling which the judge gave are read as a whole, he directed himself correctly in accordance with both the law, as it was at the time of trial, and the law in the subsequent authorities to which Mr Nutting referred: that is, that there must be evidence in relation to each defendant that he was party to an agreement to cause the death of or serious harm to Katrina Taylor by the use of a knife. See in particular the transcripts of his ruling at page 6F-G, 7E-F, 10B-C, 10G-11B, 12A-C, 14F, 15E-F, 18G-19A and 19D-F. Furthermore, we are satisfied that the circumstantial evidence identified by Mr Bevan afforded, cumulatively, a proper and sufficient case for the jury to consider against both appellants in relation both to murder and false imprisonment. The judge was therefore right to reject the defence submissions and ground 1 fails. Mr Nutting's second submission was that the judge's directions in relation to character were defective in four respects. First, he failed to remind the jury of the contents of an exhibited pink file which spoke of Smith's charity work. Secondly, he failed to refer to the evidence of a prison officer as to Smith's exemplary behaviour in custody. Thirdly, he failed to direct the jury that the appellants' previous convictions in relation to knives were relevant only to his credibility, and not to propensity. Fourthly, the credibility of Simon and Neisha Williams, whose evidence was crucial to the case against Smith and Scollan, was unfairly highlighted by the last minute direction at the end of the summing-up, prompted by prosecuting counsel, that the Williamses were of good character: the defence was therefore undermined. There is no substance in the first two of these complaints. The judge was under no obligation to rehearse all the evidence. As to previous convictions in relation to knives, the relevant passage in the summing-up is at page 129C-G. Having referred to Scollan's convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and carrying a knife, and to Smith's two convictions for robbery when knives were used, the judge said: ""The significance of that evidence that he had been involved in criminal activities when knives were used, as relied upon by Miss Woodley and Mr Kershen, is pretty obvious, but I need hardly say to you that you do not decide this case one way or the other on the existence or absence of previous convictions, you decide this case, as I have told you, on the evidence in this case. One of the basic principles of English criminal law, both of law and indeed of justice, is that we do not convict people on their records. You do not give a dog a bad name and hang him. The relevance of that evidence is to enable you to put into context the nature, character and personality of the persons who make these allegations against their co-defendants, enabling you to decide where you think the truth lies. It may also enable you to put into context the truthfulness or otherwise of Mr Smith's assertion that he made to Mr Bevan at the very outset of his cross-examination ."" Mr Bevan accepted that the phrase ""the significance is pretty obvious"" was unfortunate. But he submitted, this passage, read as a whole, made it plain that the jury could only convict on evidence and not past record. We cannot agree. It seems to us that, the judge having first said that the significance of knives was ""pretty obvious"", he did not, as he might have done, remedy the situation by giving an express direction that the knives' convictions were of no significance, save as to credibility. This passage in the summing-up, in our judgment, amounted to a misdirection. The direction about the Williamses' character came about in this way. The judge having concluded his summing-up, Mr Bevan drew attention to the provisions in Archbold arising from R v Nye 75 Cr App R 247, and the circumstances in which a person with convictions might be entitled to present himself as being of good character. The point had not apparently been canvassed by anyone at an earlier stage. Mr Bevan said, at the summing-up transcript page 157A: ""Your Lordship will forgive me if I have this wrong. In so far as Neisha Williams is concerned I think the jury know the position so far as character is concerned; one shoplifting. : One shoplifting. And you would be content I treated her as a woman of good character. MR BEVAN: I would. The same in the case of Simon Williams stealing a bicycle, and the same would apply. : Very well. I will so do. Ladies and gentlemen, let me explain. Mr Bevan is content, because of the relatively minor nature of those convictions, that both Simon Williams and his sister should be treated as being persons of good character."" The judge went on to give what, if it was appropriate, was a full and entirely correct direction as to the effect of the Williamses' good character, in that it supported their credibility and made it less likely they would be involved in serious criminal activity than persons not having a good character. The jury then retired. In the context of a cut-throat defence between the Williams, on the one hand, and the appellants on the other, this direction, it was submitted, was highly prejudicial to the appellants, particularly in its timing immediately before the jury retired. Mr Bevan plainly prompted the judge from the very best of motives, with a view to being fair to the Williamses. But the subject, as it seems to us, merited much earlier consideration, if the judge was to be in a position to exercise his discretion properly, in deciding whether or not, in all the circumstances of the case, a good character direction ought to be given in relation to the Williamses. With time for argument and reflection, he might have decided not to give such a direction at all. Mr Bevan, with characteristic candour, accepts, with the benefit of hindsight, that perhaps he should not have intervened as he did. In our judgment, coming when it did, the judge's good character direction about the Williamses was potentially significantly prejudicial to the defence of the appellants, in that it bolstered the Williamses' version of events. Mr Nutting's third submission was that the judge gave no adequate warning as to the dangers of relying on Sarah Jackson's evidence because of the interests she might wish to serve as Simon Williams' girlfriend in minimising his role and maximising the roles of the appellants. This was particularly prejudicial because he gave such a warning in relation to the appellants' girlfriends Ioannou and O'Callaghan in these terms, at transcript page 93C-E: ""Jennifer Ioannou was still very sympathetically inclined towards Trevor Smith and regarded themselves as they told you, as being engaged, and indeed Caroline O'Callaghan still feels an attachment towards Mr Scollan in so far as she has been visiting them at High Down. So that if and in so far as you think any of that part of the girls' evidence was intended to cast aspersions on either Simon or Neisha Williams you may be inclined to the view, it is a matter for you, that there may be some element of favouritism in that aspect of their evidence and you may want to think about it and treat it with a good deal of reserve."" Mr Batten stressed that Sarah Jackson was a very important witness in favour of Simon Williams, in that she gave the alleged kidnapping a voluntary character, and against the appellants in describing a worsening atmosphere after their return to No 77 on the evening of the 4th. Mr Bevan drew attention to a passage earlier in the summing-up where, when dealing with witnesses generally, the judge referred to some of them having ""had some inclinations or associations that may have affected an even handed approach"". It is to be noted that in this passage the judge said he would ""look at it later on"". In the event, as we have said, he gave directions urging caution in relation to the appellants' girlfriends, but gave no such direction in relation to Sarah Jackson, who helped Simon Williams. In our judgment, this was a non-direction, giving rise to the possibility of prejudice against the appellants. Mr Nutting's fourth submission related only to Smith and was based on alleged inadequacies in the summing-up about the letters passing between Smith and Neisha which, it is common ground, were intended to 'keep her sweet' and which were said to show she did not fear him. We find no inadequacy in the judge's reference to the letters, which were all in the jury's possession. That ground was unarguable. Mr Batten made the running, supported by Mr Nutting, on a ground of appeal critical of the conduct of junior counsel, leading for Scollan's defence at trial. It is expressed in the grounds of appeal in this way: ""The convictions are unsafe having regard to the manner in which a crucial aspect of Scollan's instructions was dealt with by counsel during the trial."" Prior to the hearing of the appeal, this Court had been supplied with an affidavit by leading counsel for Smith, exhibiting certain contemporaneous documents and a confirmatory affidavit from his junior and explanatory letters, but no documents, from Scollan's counsel, who indicated, however, that relevant notebooks and notes were in existence. At the outset of the hearing before us, we directed that these notebooks and notes should be disclosed to counsel and the Court, and they were. They are detailed and, apparently, comprehensive. We mention these matters because they explain the way in which this ground, as pursued before the Court, particularly on behalf of Scollan, differed markedly from counsel's skeleton argument. This had been based on Scollan's own initial handwritten ground that his barrister failed to follow his instructions as to the date on which he first knew about the murder. In the light of the material in counsel's notes and following an adjournment to consult his client, Mr Batten accepted that this ground could not be pursued on this basis. It could not be said that counsel did something without foundation and was seriously at fault so as to support an allegation of flagrant incompetence such as the authorities describe. Despite Scollan's sense of grievance persistently expressed during the trial and subsequently, Mr Batten accepted that it was difficult to contend before this Court that there was more than a misunderstanding between client and counsel. However, he submitted, what occurred was within the terms of what Rougier J said in giving the judgment of this Court in R v Clinton (1993) 97 Cr App R 320 at 326. Having referred to R v Gautam [1988] Crim LR 109, R v Wellings (20th December 1991) and other authorities, all decided prior to the amendment of section 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 , Rougier J said this: ""We think that the proper interpretation of the cases to which we have referred is that the Court was doing no more than providing general guidelines as to the correct approach. The Court was rightly concerned to emphasise that where counsel had made decisions in good faith after proper consideration of the competing arguments, and, where appropriate after due discussion with his client, such decisions could not possibly be said to render a subsequent verdict unsafe or unsatisfactory. Particularly does this apply to the decision as to whether or not to call the defendant. Conversely and, we stress, exceptionally where it is shown that the decision was taken either in defiance of or without proper instructions, or when all the promptings of reason and good sense pointed the other way, it may be open to an appellate Court to set aside the verdict by reason of the terms of section 2 (1)(a) of the Act . It is probably less helpful to approach the problem via the somewhat semantic exercise of trying to assess the qualitative value of counsel's alleged ineptitude, but rather to seek to assess its effect on the trial and the verdict according to the terms of the subsection."" In our judgment, those observations are of continuing validity, despite the change of wording in section 2 (1), by virtue of the provisions of the 1995 Act. The particular passage in the judgment upon which reliance in the present case is placed is the reference to ""without proper instructions"". In the light of all the material before this Court, the following nine matters now seem plain: 1. Scollan's original proof stated that he first knew of the murder on the date the police raided his home, which was 9th July. 2. Scollan, as his counsel knew, was, throughout, most anxious that his defence should be run in tandem with that of Smith. 3. His instructions in conference with counsel on 16th July, repeated in further conference on 22nd July, were that 9th July was the date of his first knowledge. 4. During the conference on 16th July, Scollan's counsel had pointed out to him, in forceful terms, that the evidence, particularly in relation to the telephone call which Smith made on 6th July, following Williams' arrest for murder, to a police station where Neisha was, strongly suggested that Smith must have known of the murder on the 6th, and must have passed this on to his friend and flat mate Scollan. Scollan's response to this, recorded in counsel's note, was ""I can't remember if Trevor passed on this information to me, about Simon's arrest, but he must have."" 5. Smith having given evidence that he first knew on 9th July, Scollan's counsel cross-examined him, during the course of the trial on 23rd July, in these terms, transcript of evidence 2H: ""I want to put to you that Neisha told you on the 6th and possibly 7th July, more likely the 6th, that in fact Katrina Taylor was dead. A. That's not true. Q. And that you conveyed that information to Fergal Scollan? A. That is not true."" 6. That cross-examination evoked from Scollan in the dock immediate, apparent, dissent, in shaking his head as described by Smith's leading counsel in affidavit. It also caused consternation in Smith's legal team which led to vigorous exchanges between counsel for the two appellants, into the details of which it is unnecessary to go, save to say that each team came to believe that the other's client was seeking improperly to influence the conduct of their client's defence. 7. When Scollan gave evidence, he said that he first knew of the murder on 9th July. 8. At no stage did Scollan's counsel seek to give to the judge, jury or other counsel in the case, any explanation as to how the divergence between her cross-examination and his evidence had arisen. 9. That divergence formed the subject, as Mr Bevan told us, of vigorous comment by each of the leading counsel appearing for the two Williamses and by himself as counsel for the prosecution. The judge, in his summing-up, referred to the matter in this way, 147B-F: ""He also claimed that he also heard nothing about Katrina's death until his brother rang him on 9th July, and here is a second point, because as you were reminded about only yesterday, that is not what was put to Trevor Smith by Miss Belford on behalf of Mr Scollan. She suggested -- again it is suggested to you no doubt upon Mr Scollan's instructions, that they were told of Katrina's death on Saturday 6th July and not that he got to hear about it from his brother on the 9th, and the suggestion to you therefore is that here he has changed his story in order to conform to the evidence that Mr Smith had given everyone when he was in the witness box, and Mr Scollan heard him, and therefore you are invited to conclude that he also is not concerned to tell you the truth as he knows it to be, but to tell a story which so far as he possibly can conforms with that which Mr Smith has already said. It is a matter for you as to what you think about that."" We record as a matter of history, though it has no impact on the appeal that, on more than one occasion, including during the summing-up, there were conferences between Scollan and his counsel in which the merits of Scollan sacking her were discussed. In our judgment, in the light of these matters, Scollan is entitled to feel a sense of grievance that, for whatever reason, the cross-examination of Smith as to date of knowledge was not in accordance with his instructions. In itself this would afford no ground for appeal. But it is apparent, from the use made of this divergence by other counsel in the case and from the passage in the summing-up which we have read, that the divergence between the cross-examination on his behalf and the evidence which he gave, loomed large in the case, to the likely detriment of Scollan's credibility. Furthermore, as Mr Bevan rightly accepts, there was a serious knock-on effect so far as Smith was concerned. The prosecution case against him, that he had sought to persuade his girlfriend and Neisha to provide a false alibi for 4th July, that he was in the forefront of the group offering violence in the search for the burglars, and the evidence of Williams that they had lied to the police because of fear of Smith, would all have been supported if, as might well have appeared to the jury, Smith had been putting pressure on Scollan to change his account as to the date of knowledge. Furthermore, the judge rightly directed the jury that the cases of Smith and Scollan stood or fell together. In our judgment, highly unusual though the circumstances of this case on this aspect are, they give rise to concern that Scollan's apparent change of story, figuring in the case as significantly as it did, may well have prejudiced the jury against both him and Smith. The case against these appellants was formidable. The terms of the summing-up in relation to character and Sarah Jackson and counsel's cross-examination of Smith, would not, separately, have rendered these convictions unsafe. But their combined effect is such that we cannot be confident that, had the trial proceeded properly in relation to these three matters, the jury's verdicts would necessarily have been the same. It follows that we must regard the convictions as unsafe. Accordingly, the appeals of both appellants are allowed and their convictions are quashed. We should add that we have considered a letter from Scollan's counsel, dated 14th October, in which she makes an application for an order for costs in her favour, in relation to this appeal. All we propose to say is that, in the light of the judgment which we have given, such an order would not be appropriate, and that application is refused. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mr Nutting, is there any reason why there should not be a retrial? MR NUTTING: I have given that matter some thought, I am bound to admit that I can find no argument which would persuade, or might persuade, your Lordships not to make that order. MR DEIN: My Lord, we have nothing to say on the matter. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We shall direct that these appellants be retried. We direct that a fresh indictment be preferred, as soon as may be. Mr Bevan, so far as the place of retrial is concerned? MR BEVAN: That has concerned me. Your Lordship might appreciate, this trial was at Lewes. It attracted a considerable amount of local interest, press - I cannot speak about the media, but certainly a lot of newspaper attention. In my submission, it would be quite wrong for this trial to take place in that area, for that obvious reason. It is not very long ago. It was allegedly, or in fact, a nasty killing, whoever was responsible, and, in my submission, Lewes and that area is the wrong venue. I would respectfully submit that the Central Criminal Court would be the right court in this particular case. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Does anyone dissent from that? MR NUTTING: No, I was going to ask your Lordship for a section 4 (2) order. Contempt of Court Act section 4 (2) order, preventing publicity against the possibility that it was going to be tried in the area where publicity has been so necessarily and understandably current. But, in the circumstances of the application, if your Lordship is disposed to allow Mr Bevan's application, I do not think, in the circumstances, I need to make an application for that order. THE VICE PRESIDENT: We shall direct the trial take place at the Central Criminal Court. I expect legal aid would be sought for leading and junior counsel separately for each of these defendants on the retrial. We grant that. In the meantime, subject to any further application, they will remain in custody. MR NUTTING: Order for solicitors too. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yes, of course. In relation to both appellants. Is there anything else we need to deal with? I am told we ought to direct they be re-arraigned within a period of 2 months, and we do so direct. © 1998 Crown Copyright"

On 7 June 2024, following a trial in the Crown Court at Nottingham before Turner J and a jury, he was convicted of murder. He now renews his application for leave to appeal against conviction following refusal by the single judge. A co-defendant, whom it is unnecessary to name in this judgment, was also convicted of murder. He was aged 13 at the time of the offence. His application for leave to appeal against conviction was refused by the single judge and has not been renewed. Because of the age of the co-defendant, the provisions of section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 are engaged in this case. An order under that provision was made in the Crown Court preventing any reporting of his identity, or anything tending to identify him. That order, we direct, extends to these proceedings as well, although it is unnecessary in fact to name the co-defendant for the purposes of this judgment. There is an application for an extension of time of 19 days in which to apply for leave to appeal, following the refusal of the single judge. No reason has been given for that. However, without treating that as a formality, we make it clear that if we considered that there was arguable merit in the grounds of appeal which have been presented, we would have extended time. In fact, we have concluded that there is no arguable merit in those grounds and therefore an extension of time would serve no purpose and we refuse it. It is unnecessary to set out the facts of this tragic case in any great detail. The deceased died because the applicant and his co-accused became involved in an argument with him, during which each of them threw pieces of brick at him, causing a fatal head injury. The applicant's case at trial was that he did not intend to cause really serious harm or to kill and that whatever he did was in reasonable self-defence of himself or of another. He gave evidence in support of that defence. He explained that he did throw the brick at Mr Edwards, but he said that he did not intend it to hit him or to injure him, and that he had no idea that his co-accused was doing the same thing at the same time in the same place. In those circumstances it was necessary for the judge to direct the jury about the element of the offence of murder which requires proof of an intention to do at least really serious harm. It was also necessary for the judge to direct the jury about the law governing self-defence. The judge prepared written directions and a route to verdict. The route to verdict contained five questions and is a model of clarity and analytical accuracy. The questions which the jury was required to answer are identified with complete clarity. The proposed grounds of appeal suggest that the conviction is nevertheless unsafe because: first, the judge did not include a ""focused self-defence direction"" in view of the applicant's age and characteristics; and second, the judge failed to provide assistance to the jury as to how the age and characteristics of the applicant might assist in their considerations. Those grounds seek to rely on the decision of this court in R v ZA [2023] EWCA Crim 596 , which is a decision about how the youth of a young offender ought to be dealt with in the course of criminal proceedings, in particular in relation to sentence. The single judge gave full reasons for rejecting those contentions. He quoted the relevant directions given by the trial judge in written directions to the jury, which included a completely standard direction about self-defence which was tailored to the case by including a direction that the age and characteristics of the defendant should be taken into account when deciding whether he had believed that it was necessary to use force and that the amount of force used was reasonable at the time when he did what he did. The trial judge reminded the jury that the applicant was 18 years old at the time and that he had a developmental disorder and autism. He said this: ""You will no doubt bear in mind that young people such as these two have not yet fully acquired the emotional control, restraint, awareness of risk, and the ability to appreciate the consequences of their own and others' actions, which is associated with mature adults. It is also known that educational difficulties and mental health issues negatively affect the development of those adult thought processes. You will apply these considerations to your assessment of all aspects of your assessment of the acts and intentions of these defendants, considering each of them separately, and I direct you so to do."" As the single judge concluded, that direction was entirely apt to deal with the particular circumstances of the case. It informed the jury and reminded them of the relevant matters which they had to consider when answering the questions which had been set out for them. In our judgment, the proposed grounds of appeal against conviction in this case are simply unarguable. The decision of the Court of Appeal in R v ZA is not a decision about how a jury should be directed in the case of a young person standing trial. It is of no relevance to the complaint in this case. For those reasons this renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction is refused, as is the application for an extension of time for the reason already given. _______________________________ BAILII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback | Donate to BAILII URL: https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2025/919.html","Howitt, R. v [2025] EWCA Crim 919 (17 June 2025) England and Wales Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) Decisions ] EWCA Crim 919 Case No 2024/02925/B2 ON APPEAL FROM THE CROWN COURT AT NOTTINGHAM (MR JUSTICE TURNER) [31CF1946423] B e f o r e : LORD JUSTICE EDIS MRS JUSTICE CUTTS DBE MR JUSTICE DEXTER DIAS ____________________ R EX - v - KAI HOWITT ____________________ Computer Aided Transcription of Epiq Europe Ltd, Lower Ground Floor, 46 Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1JE Tel No: 020 7404 1400; Email: rcj@epiqglobal.co.uk ( to the Court) ____________________ Non Counsel Application ____________________ ____________________ Tuesday 17 June 2025 LORD JUSTICE EDIS: The applicant, Kai Howitt, was born on 13 March 2005 and he is now aged 20.

The single judge gave full reasons for rejecting those contentions. He quoted the relevant directions given by the trial judge in written directions to the jury, which included a completely standard direction about self-defence which was tailored to the case by including a direction that the age and characteristics of the defendant should be taken into account when deciding whether he had believed that it was necessary to use force and that the amount of force used was reasonable at the time when he did what he did. The trial judge reminded the jury that the applicant was 18 years old at the time and that he had a developmental disorder and autism. He said this: ""You will no doubt bear in mind that young people such as these two have not yet fully acquired the emotional control, restraint, awareness of risk, and the ability to appreciate the consequences of their own and others' actions, which is associated with mature adults. It is also known that educational difficulties and mental health issues negatively affect the development of those adult thought processes. You will apply these considerations to your assessment of all aspects of your assessment of the acts and intentions of these defendants, considering each of them separately, and I direct you so to do."" As the single judge concluded, that direction was entirely apt to deal with the particular circumstances of the case. It informed the jury and reminded them of the relevant matters which they had to consider when answering the questions which had been set out for them. In our judgment, the proposed grounds of appeal against conviction in this case are simply unarguable. The decision of the Court of Appeal in R v ZA is not a decision about how a jury should be directed in the case of a young person standing trial. It is of no relevance to the complaint in this case. For those reasons this renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction is refused, as is the application for an extension of time for the reason already given. _______________________________"
